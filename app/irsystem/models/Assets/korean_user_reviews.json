{"0": ["It's quite an intense drama, with a bit of everything romance, murder, a lot of rather interesting lawsuits and a dash of supernatural. Actually, I really like super powers/fantasy/etc. but the mind reading in this story was a bit strange - we weren't suggested any explanation for it and it seemed to come and go for strange reasons (it appeared because of an intense trauma and then went away when the character lost his memories, only for him to regain his powers the moment he remembered the trauma in question). The romance is cute and all the characters are very entertaining, with strong personalities (even the small side characters manage to be easy to remember). Anyway... because I'm too lazy to write a long review I'm just going to say that I recommend this to those that can get into a pretty long story (the episodes are 1h long and A LOT of things happen all the time) with a bit of interesting debates on ethics (and law).", "I love this drama! I just watched in two days and just sleep 3 hours I'm a total sucker for Lee Bo Young romances and Lee Jong Suk, the writer knows how to touch our hearts! The plot arrangement was very very impressive and the characters combination was suitable with the storyline. Many messages that i got from this drama. After watching episode 18 learning the true meaning of Hearing people's voice, the feeling I got is something I have never felt before... Once again I have to give it to Korean story. Better than anything i have seen so far. Excellent performance by all the casts specially Lee Bo-Young. This is must watch drama", "This is the first drama I've watched where Lee Jong Suk was one of the lead actors. I was simply amazed and kept wanting to watch the next episode, no wonder they added a few episodes after they reached the initial announced number and of course I get now why the series received so many awards.Lee Jong Suk plays someone who has gained the ability to read minds, after he was involved in a car accident which killed his father when he was a child. The driver who hit the car, actually aimed at killing both father and child, however the main actress was present and even though she was intimidated into not going to court to testify whether the accident was no accident, she did go. The series starts basically from the point both main actors grew up. It is interesting how they meet, how they work together and how they protect one another. I would suggest this series to anyone as I believe it can match the tastes of any viewer.", "I have always loved court room dramas and legal thrillers- books, movies, soaps and sitcoms. I like those well written scripts that take advantage of the loopholes in law to build powerful twists in the plots, keeping the audience or viewers engaged till the end. 'I hear your voice' is a romantic comedy- my most favorite of Korean drama genres, with the right amount of courtroom cases, and a bit of fantasy. The episodes were an easy watch, interesting and entertaining. He is a high school kid who can hear people's thoughts. These extra voices in his ears make his world noisier. She is a lawyer- a public defender, quite a few years older than him. She is his first love. He admired her since she came as a witness of his father's murder to the trial 10 years ago. Searching for her when he grew up, he found her on the pages of a newspaper. Then as they became closer, from just acquaintances in a case, he starts helping her during trials- by reading everyone's minds; and she takes the responsibility of his guardian. It's just fun to watch them \u2013 when she tries to hide her humiliations and embarrassed thoughts from him, but he reads them anyhow. I like the plot twists a lot. The prisoner of 10 years is now released, who holds a grudge against the public defender, as she had been a witness to that murder, and threatens to kill her. But her protector is there to save her from every mishap with all his might.I'm loving it!!! It's one unconventional love story...", "It is so enjoyable, kind of sad, funny, and romantic. Although I'm not a fan of fiction in drama I literally enjoyed everything; the characters, the acting, the plot, the court scenes, and the cases were so realistic and touching. I cried in many scenes, got angry and disappointed in some. But I was satisfied with the ending.", "my second lee jong suk drama.

Maybe I was expecting too much out of it. The story is okay, with the big case with the vilain and everything, but it gets tiring after a while. The drama uses cliches like amnesia as twists, but overall, it was just okay, with a so so romance, as the characters didn't have chemistry. The cases though were interesting to follow, but often the main story took over and left them in the premisses to fill in the gaps. Now, the performances were okay, especially from the actor that played the bad guy, who was excellent.

The stories of the characters seem different from one another, but they come together in the end, painting the picture of the story as a whole.

Its really too bad the director though the movie needed more 'action scenes', when the suspense and storyline provides more than ample amount of excitement! South Korea is proving to be one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world, but this entry just barely lives up to that title. There are FAR more exciting and well put together SK movies out there, such as, 'Oldboy', 'Memories of Murder', 'Mother', 'I Saw The Devil', and quite a bit more.Full Review at: www.simplefilmreviews.com/2014/05/confession-of-murder-2012.html", "In Korea, the serial-killer Lee Du-sok (Shi-hoo Park) has killed ten women and there is another one missing that the police department believes he is the responsible for her disappearance. After fifteen years, the statute of limitation expires on his last murder and Lee Du- sok publishes a book describing each murder in details. Detective Choi (Jae-yeong Jeong), who was in charge of the investigation of all the ten murders, chases Lee Du-sok and challenges him to tell where the eleventh victim is. Meanwhile, Han Ji-Soo (Young-Ae Kim), who is the mother of his last victim, seeks revenge with her family and friends. The owner of a sensationalist television network invites Lee Du-sok and Detective Choi for a debate live. Out of the blue, a man with the alias \"J\" calls the TV during the debate and tells that he is the real killer and Lee Du-sok is a fraud. Who should be the real killer?\"Nae-ga sal-in-beom-i-da\", a.k.a. \"Confession of Murder\", is an engaging South-Korean thriller with a great story. The performances are top-notch but the main twist is predictable and explains the behavior of Choi, despite surprising many viewers. There is also a criticism to the behavior of the media and public in general, worshipping a serial- killer because he is handsome. The only remark is the excessive and exaggerated action scenes; however they are part of the entertainment. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Confiss\u00e3o de Assassinato\" (\"Confession of Murder\")", "This movie was a strange mix of cartoon-funny, thriller, noir and drama, all packed in an adventure.There are some twists you don't see coming, and when they do, they come down pouring. Some may find them predictable but considering the pacing of the movie I do not deem most of them predictable, except the first one, and this is not actually good all because of timing. Since I do not intend to share any spoiler here, it will be hard for me to explain my point of view, but I will give it a try: The movie twist-bombs you during a single scene of confrontation up until which you had time to dwell on possibilities but wouldn't, in my case at least, because I was too busy savoring the rich performances, an already gruesome and captivating story, and even if I saw a twist coming and try to wrap my head around it, it was hard for me to let the next twist sink in amid all the empathy the story and some of the performances forced me to experience. The shockers in this movie are serious in content and this crowd of twists causes a desensitization in the viewer that doesn't let the whole thing sink in. Where there could be a punch, these are like successive little slaps in your face.I find the cartoonishly unrealistic scenes in the movie to be a treat. It was nice to watch but it also had a function: it gave a glimpse of the new characters that were introduced, the way a caricature does.The social commentary is where the perfectly executed noir steps in. A great satire to public perception of psychopathy and how it is engineered by media. Might give some insight to those clueless people out there who haven't yet realized how we transitioned from denouncing behavior that exudes lack of empathy to glamorizing it, condoning the criminals it breeds, because, you know as well as I do how much we are attracted to people in Wall Street as they speculate and kill our future with a single phone call because of all that sexy hair and slick outfit and their \"intelligence\". Well, there is no \"high functioning\" psycho in the movie, but the commentary nails it nonetheless.It is the pacing of the later twists with respect to twist content that led me to give this one an 7. The punch vs slap thing, in other words.It is a great thriller tainted with abundance of stuff at the cost of more important stuff. The actors in this movie did a great job and character development could have been much better had the script allowed room for it. Come to think of it, this movie should have been at least half an hour longer. As it is, it feels like they crammed it all in 1.5 hour so as not to cut it short.If you are binge thriller watchers, watch this one. It is a nice Korean thriller by all means. If you look for more in a movie, then I think it is still worth to give a shot. My guess is that you will be both delighted and disappointed but you will be nowhere near \"what did I just watch?\". No. This one's better than that.", "I don't know exactly where to start. What I do know, is that the movie is incredible! Korean cinema has brought a lot of talent forward and they have made some incredible movies over the last 10-20 years. This just continues in that same line. Don't get me wrong, not every movie from Korea is phenomenal. But this one (that will clearly get a US remake sometime soon) has to be in the category of the great ones.I don't want to spoil too much (the title does give you a hint, where this movie is taking you), but you will get more than just a question about morality here. There's also entertainment and suspense and a subplot that works pretty well. You might not understand some character motivations while watching it, but you will get it eventually.I guess there is only one minor thing that you might be able to complain about. It's the fact that the movie could have ended a bit earlier. It seems that they \"stretched\" the ending. I still liked it, but I can see why people would have wanted it to end 10-15 minutes earlier, when \"all is said and done\" (though as it turns out, not everything had been done)", "The bad: Really highly improbable car stunt and other action scenes that had the likelihood and ludicrousness of comic book writing. People jumping from rooftops; out of moving vehicles onto hospital gurneys or tops of other cars while fighting as if no more dangerous than on a kitchen table top, etc. I wasn't sure if it was meant to be spoofing movies that go cheaply overboard in that direction, or not. Decided not, that they were serious. A sadly laughable distraction that lessened the intelligence of the storyline. The good: As others will state it has a novel crime thriller twist and turn structure not seen elsewhere. Kudos for that. Overall score = 6.", "The latest Korean action-thriller to hit theatres in Singapore, 'Confession of Murder' is a gem of a film that can be compared to the likes of 'Old Boy' and 'Memories of Murder'.At the heart of this movie is the tale of Detective Choi, whose quest is to capture the one thing that evades him. It's a very human resolve and one that is particularly relatable to the people of our time. We're not all cops searching for a suspect, but very much like Detective Choi, we have that one answer that we seek our entire lives and work hard to find out. The prevalence and influence of the media, plastic surgery, as well as blind devotion to a public figure have all been gracefully written into the script, and so surrounding that story is a context so rooted in reality that it could very well be our own daily lives.The performances in this film are truly commendable, particularly those of the stuntmen for the deadly accurate execution of the stunts. In particular, the main actors brilliantly brought in the subtle aspects of their characters, in order to bring humanity to a larger-than life drama, effectively giving a hook for the audience to relate to the movie on a deeper level.There is also dark humor in the movie, which brings some levity into an otherwise dark world that the audience becomes immersed in. One almost feels guilty for laughing, which is a testament to the irony of the humor. What makes the situation on screen so humorous is how exceedingly close it is to what would happen if such a thing were to take place in real-life. Such a thing is almost never portrayed in films for the sake of cinematic impact- but by doing the opposite, 'Confession of Murder' turns itself into almost a satire and criticism of popular culture.This is one film that defines 'order in chaos' and does so with a great deal of style. The makers of it have taken a complex plot and planned it out with such precision that even to the non-Korean speaking viewer, the story being told is clear and concise. There is no beating around the bush with this film. The pacing is just right such that Confession of Murder never loses the audience's attention, and even at the most tumultuous times of this film (such as one of the many fast-paced dialogue exchanges), details are never lost. Even the action sequences have been tightly-choreographed in order to mould into the complex camera-work and it shows on screen as a beautiful and graceful wedding of skills from both cast and crew. The twist at the end is also a reminder of what great cinema is and is capable of doing, i.e. shocking the audience by leaving out one aspect of the story and then revealing it at the end only to change the audience's entire perspective of what has happened all along. It is making the audience feel like they should have known better. It also proves the uncomfortable truth that we are capable of being fooled, and that reality as we perceive it is often imperfect.In this film, the peripeteia then leads to a startling climax which fulfils the purpose of every character in this film before moving down into a resolution which leaves no loose ends untied. Indeed, 'Confession of Murder' is a film indeed worth watching and a tale highly relevant to our celebrity-obsessed times.", "There are no lack of examples when it comes to very sterling specimens of solid psychological crime thrillers to come out of South Korean cinema in recent years, and it's no different that Confession of Murder also belongs up there with one of the best the country has to offer in the genre. Written and directed by Jung Byoung-Gil, whose earlier film was the documentary Action Boys, he has shown that he's not all just about action, but has the knack in crafting a taut thriller with its fair share of twists, turns, and more importantly, providing it with such a tormented soul that will allow you to feel sympathetic for the victims involved, and root for retribution on the culprit. If that can be found out.At first glance, the story seems simple enough, with Detective Choi Hyung-Goo (Jung Jae- Young) losing his opportunity to nab a masked serial killer who had claimed more than 10 victims in a random killing spree, with that obsession spiralling his life downwards with the ultimate insult added to injury when his mouth got slit by the killer's knife, leaving a deep scar he bears as a symbol to his failure. Fast forward to some 15 years, and with the Statute of Limitations expired, Lee Doo-Suk (Park Si-Hoo) comes out in the open to admit he is the killer responsible for the spate of deaths, and now releasing a book as a memoir and confession to his dastardly deeds. A little bit of an artistic license here I believe, since the Statute of Limitations is only for civil cases and not criminal ones like this, but let's not quibble and accept that it does pose an intriguing proposition, something like double jeopardy.So begins the cat and mouse chase of trying to prove, or disprove that Lee was indeed that man more than a decade ago who had shattered the lives of many family members with his killings, and now arrogantly living the high life of a celebrity, no thanks to celebrity culture that we cannot understand fully, where cult followings grow out of the most bizarre of situations, and those who are good looking are automatically assumed improbable to doing the most wicked of deeds. With bodyguards in tow and the law shackled by its own statutes, there is little that Detective Choi can do except to sit back and witness media adoration, and rocket sales of a book that shouldn't have been published in the first place.Similar to Park Chan Wook's Sympathy for Lady Vengeance, the events that unfold her include that of the impact to family, and how family decide to take it upon themselves in vigilante style to execute their brand of justice when the law gets paralyzed. In between the more emotional, dramatic moments where their pain get experienced with Lee's sheer audacity of a public appearance and confession, director Jung felt it was perhaps appropriate to inject extremely light comedy to diffuse heavier moments that were dangerously close to stagnating the narrative, with a wee bit of action for good measure as well. Something's not quite right, and there's more than meets the eye of course, when yet another man comes out to claim notoriety and responsibility to the serial killings, throwing everything you'd assume into disarray.Which is a good thing of course, especially for the jaded amongst us who constantly think we have seen it all. What the story, also by Jung, did was not only to lapse into providing red herrings that were obvious, but to really invest an audience's time and emotions into the story. We learn about a select group of victims, and how their unnatural passing causes inexplicable pain to their closest ones, and the brilliance here is to make it really personal as well for Detective Choi, with vested interest to want to bring the murderer to justice, yet hampered by the same law he is sworn to uphold as an officer.This primary dilemma, plus what I thought was the ultimate twist, followed by the obligatory finale pursuit, and emotional closure, was what made Confession of Murder a carefully thought out crime thriller, in a genre that's becoming increasingly challenging to have novelty and originality, but Jung showed there's still substance in the tank on top of having very polished and stylish production values rewarding the patient audience. Having the right cast was also half the battle won, with Jung Jae-Young as the detective and Park Si-Hoo the confessor sharing good chemistry opposite each other in this high stakes cat and mouse game. A definite recommendation!", "Featuring an intriguing premise, cleverly plotted for the most part & portraying a very unsettling side of society, Confession of Murder is another impressive outing from South Korean cinema that continues the Asian film industry's trend of delivering one solid revenge thriller after another without showing any signs of fatigue and even though it's not amongst the finest examples of its genre, it's a good one nonetheless.The story of Confession of Murder concerns a police detective who is haunted by his failure to capture a serial-killer 15 years ago when, after the expiration of statute of limitations, the killer publishes an autobiography describing each one of his murders in gruesome detail through which he claims of repentance for his crimes. But his authenticity is soon questioned when another person claiming to be the real killer turns up.Directed by Jung Byung-gil, this is his mainstream feature film debut & even though the story suffers from few scenes that are far too outstretched or predictable, it's a solid start to his mainstream career. Screenplay is another fine aspect as the twists are nicely timed & events unfold in a steady manner, camera-work shows a dynamic range from frequently edited cuts to lingering shots & music also has a nice vibe to it.The performances are good with both lead actors constantly challenging each other but the one problem I have is with some sequences that seem unnecessarily exaggerated, not to mention the CGI elements which look mind-numbingly horrible. Yet, the best part is the society it portrays where the supposed serial killer becomes a media sensation due to his good looks & gets his own fan following despite the unforgivable acts he committed.On an overall scale, Confession of Murder might be predictable despite its twists n turns and isn't further helped by its non-linear narration which doesn't contributing much to the cinematic experience anyway but it's another fine addition to the long list of dark thrillers South Korea has been churning out since the dawn of the new century. It is no masterpiece, not even close to one, but the final ride still feels more satisfying than a mere disappointment.", "I can't tell anything from the movie, because everything would be spoiler. I was just amazed by the feeling of this movie.It's a little bit faster, has more action involved, than most of the slow Korean thrillers. Maybe there is a little bit of Hollywood in it. The storyline is just amazing, the only bad things are some illogical, meaningless action scene, but I couldn't give other then 10 points because of that. I will be interested in the rating of this film, after hitting the theaters...I recommend this to everyone, who likes original, interesting situations and story, and wicked twists.", "This is actually a really good thriller, mainly because of the creative twist near the end. But even the build up is nicely done. Korea has this law where if they can't solve a case for 15yrs they dismiss it. And even if the person that committed certain crimes is revealed, the authority can't do anything about it. In Korea they changed the law to more then 15yrs. But anyways it's about what if that person that committed a atrocious crime such as murder reveals himself to the public. And a cop is right on his tail to get even with the guy, because he has a major beef with the culprit. I thought it was going to go in that \"Law Abiding Citizen\" sort of direction but am glad that it's actually far from it. It does have some goofy scenes that takes away from the seriousness. But it doesn't take away from the movie as a whole much. Park Si-hoo is just excellent playing the role of the murderer, especially because of his soft and gentle-spoken voice and his taunting smile. But currently he is in a very bad situation for himself in real life which will tarnish his reputation and probably even destroy his career.7.8/10", "I've said it countless times, the quality of Movies coming out of South Korea is incredible.This movie is one of my favorites. Firstly, I love Jae-yeong Jeong in this. All the acting is brilliant, all the characters are great.Secondly, I love the pace of this movie. The speed is great. Even though maybe a little improbable the action scenes really liven the movie up.Thirdly, the ending.This is a great movie. If you love South Korean movies, why have you not seen this one. If you have not seen any South Korean movies then start watching South Korean movies and start off with this one.", "First 10 minutes.I feel shocked because this movie started spontaneously with action, which it is too cool and make all audiences mute while their eyes watching all the movement carefully. One thing popped up in my mind, ''This is what I want, not some talking mouth before action but this is it!''.In the middle of nowhere.After that, the momentum down, really really down just after the moment of the confession. All clich\u00e9 from everyday korean movie come, flamboyant power rangers action, illogically scene such as empty traffic in the middle of the day of the busily korean city, unnecessary temper, unfunny comedy. At this part, all things move too fast as rushing, if they slow it down it will be better and not to ruin the audience's mood. But must be careful because many hint showed.Last 40 minutes.When my mood keep going down, it grab its momentum back with a really really good twist that's unthinkable and unpredictable. The momentum rise back and make all the audience cannot leave their seat, ever to yawn. If I'm the president of south Korea I will just change the law and catch the murderer if he just confess like that. But I'm not korean so I don't know their law. However, in this part all my curiosity answered and prevent me from going to give this movie such a low rate. This is a not a good movie but enjoyable and can satisfy all the action-packed-thriller lover. Try this!", "This is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a really long time. I Loved it. I've seen some reviews saying that it was over acted and unbelievable stunts performed but I honestly thought the acting and stunts were on point. They were intended to convey the irrationality of wanting and trying to do anything to get the revenge. Not only that though. It was even more irrational due to the statute of limitation being up and the inability to ever have justice unless they got it themselves. My only complaint is that I wish they would've discussed what the victims had gone through. It would've help in understanding the rage that the loved ones were feeling.", "Wow, impressive opening scene. The film is so well made and with the serious plot, it is a pity some of the scenes were made as comical as they did. The comic relief seemed completely out of place for this type of film. Thankfully, they abandon this during the second half of the film. After the halfway mark, we're hit with twist upon twist - and its both fascinating and shocking. Shi-hoo Park was excellent in his role. Notably, Yeong-ae Kim was also excellent as Victim's Mom.When the big reveal comes about who really wrote the book, a lot doesn't really add up and some of the character's actions are questionable, but that aside, this was one of the most intriguing Korean films I've seen. The action scenes are so well made, it feels as if you're part of the action. The film's final moments are indeed a heart pounding adrenaline rush.", "Don't watch the trailer, go in blind. That's my advice before seeing this movie.\nI can't explain the plot, it will ruin the movie.It's a great thriller in my opinion, where it falls short is the forced and Hollywood-esque action scenes, there is no need for them and they feel out of place.I would have given this movie a higher score if the director had pulled back on the action scenes, the story and the characters are great. I really enjoyed this movie overall. It's a thriller that needs to be seen!", "This definitely reeks of OJ, but is so much more entertaining.Is there seriously a Statute of Limitations in Korea (or anywhere, that is) which allows people to confess their crimes after a certain amount of time with no repercussions? Okay, #1, real or not, you'll have to buy that to watch this movie and #2, I'm on the next flight there.Well, once again, Internet Channel and Horror-Wannabe-One-Stop Shudder led me to believe this was horror. Perhaps their purchase negotiator saw \"Murder\" in the title and snatched this up without reading a single synopsis. This is not horror. BUT, it is a REALLY good movie.It's more action, comedy and mystery. It's also one of the most original movies I've seen recently. Man those Asians, specifically, in this case, Koreans, know real storytelling. That Asian market of films is making me completely turn my back on my own country. While our country is focused on bucks from remakes, reboots, caving in and shameless knockoffs for even more money, Asians are making Art.I digress...Confession of Murder is a delightful revenge thriller with a ton of action, comedy and heart. It's brilliant with its twists and turns and red herrings - only these are for the plot and not characters. You truly think it's going one way, and a sharp left makes you humble. I clicked on this movie with the simple icon of the movie poster with two Korean men and the title. It was a part of my Shudder subscription, so as a fan of horror, I obliged. So, when I offer the synopsis, I want to be as simple as possible so you can enjoy this roller coaster of great storytelling as I did.The movie begins with an incredible chase scene in the rain from an obvious cop and a more obvious intelligent bad guy. No spoilers, as this is just the synopsis and is only the first 5 minutes of the two-hour movie, the bad guy gets away and years later \"comes clean\" with a memoir of all the murders he's committed in a nice, neat novel. He's allowed to due to a Statute of Limitations (SOL) law that states if not charged with a crime following a certain amount of time (15 years,) he/she cannot be charged with the crime. And now...let the mayhem begin with these \"confessions of murder.\"Again, that's just the first 5 minutes or so. So, I didn't spoil much. Besides, maybe I get an SOL-discount since the movie came out 6 years ago and surely by now, I'm free to talk about 5 minutes screen time of a movie.The movie's two biggest flaws are: the runtime and suspension of disbelief. The grand majority of Asian films I stream have to be right at the 2-hour mark, close to it or way above it. They certainly do not know how to edit, or are too terribly arrogant with their art. In most cases, it definitely can be cut down some, but that might be just this ole American guy used to shorter movies.Oh, and that second point? Suspending our disbelief. Well, aside from the SOL issue, there's a few great action sequences that reminded me of many more movies, such as The Matrix Reloaded, Lethal Weapon 3, Captain America: Civil War / Black Panther, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Death Proof and The Transporter films...and is just as unrealistic. Sure they're fun to look at and get into the action, but to believe one moment, is to totally live in a fantasy world.Nevertheless, I had fun with the comedy that made me laugh out loud a few times, tear up with the heart of the victims, marvel at the action that was well choreographed and most of all, LOVE the script that kept evolving and keeping me glued to the edge of my seat. Well done. Well done.***Final thoughts: So, just for fun, I, right now, watched the trailer to see if gave anything away. Amazingly, it did not. It perfectly gave enough to the audience to see this movie and like I did above, provided the few seconds of the movie to evoke interest. Man...stop making me hate Hollywood so much in lieu of wonderful Asian cinema! You guys/gals do it so much better!", "Asian thrillers have always fascinated me. This one is no exception. Although the climax could be much better. There are plenty of twists in the movie to keep you guessing.Overall, a 6 1/2 out of 10 movie. The hero of the movie has actually done pretty good acting. The movie could have been shortened a bit. Running at the length of 1.54 minutes is a bit long. Although Korean movie \"Memories of murder \" is highly rated than this film. I suggest you to watch that also. Korean movies are always a delight to watch. Had to watch this with subtitles as my native language is not korean. Overall ratings: Direction 7/10. Story 9/10. Acting 8/10.", "i just finish watching the memory of murderer, so my expectation for a Korea serial movie is sky-high. but how am i wrong, the plot is lacking and it sadden but it can be develop into powerful story , the villain seem to be more powerful than god, he can be hit by a car, by a crane, fell from building and been shot at but still alive. the chemistry between casts was not on par. the mom and her lackey should not been there at all. they just added an unnecessary plot and conflict, it create a confusion, how come the killer can leave the scene of his murder unscathed but our unneeded hero can't even walk on a stair for 10 step before 5 police car come out from nowhere.", "Starts with a bang, with a great chase sequence, only slightly marred by some bad CG.After that, it settles down for awhile, but it's a pretty engaging story, some real interesting stuff. Got a little Big Bad Wolves going on. But then the INSANE tonal shifts start cropping up and also one of the worst action sequences I've ever seen, this car chase that is absolutely terrible.It looks like something out of a soap opera, the way it was shot, all flat and weird and then there's the CG that looks like it fell out of 1993 and the editing is a nightmare. It's just an incredible garbage presentation.And\u0085OK, let's go to Spoiler Town, Population: The Whole Damn MovieSo there's two bits early on that let me figure out what was going on. The dude jumping to his death and then the fake killer whispering in the Lt.'s ear. I figured, huh, OK, I see where this is going. But that's fine, right? Because, initially, it was an interesting trip.But as it was happening, I started thinking about it, and that's the movie's fault. It would stop being engaging enough or have too much garbage and I would be distracted by the plot. Why the hell is the plan to have this happen literally minutes before the statute of limitations is up? The Lt. clearly has the leg up with that recording. And while, obviously, being a serial killer, J is arrogant enough to agree to this interview but like how incredibly lucky was the Lt. for it to happen an hour before he can't be prosecuted!?! OK, and so fine, whatever. Then there's this terrible, overly cg'd chase where the serial killer has broken like 20 other laws, enough to get his ass locked up for forever. But they're still going on about only a couple of minutes and then they can't prosecute again. Dog! He just stole like 4 vehicles, took people hostage, wrecked everything\u0085I'm pretty sure his ass is going to jail FOR THAT!And then, the cherry on this poop sundae is the maudlin (and for some reason, first person) flashback leading up to his lady getting offed and I mean, come on. We get it. We got it earlier. If you're trying to give us some reason for him killing J, it's no surprise. It's just maudlin, sappy trash. Ugh.I had gone from enjoying the movie to being incredibly mad at it, all within the last 35 minutes or so. It started off as a solid enough, Seven kind of thing (but like if Seven had a scene where Brad Pitt goes to the zoo and has wacky, Adam Sandler-esqe antics or Morgan Freeman has to take a dump while fighting a sewer alligator) and just devolved into another garbage-ass thriller.", "With South Korea emerging as one of the strongest sources of great thriller/action cinema, Confession of Murder certainly wasn't born into easy water. While Director Jeong Byeonggil delivered on gritty action sequences, the movie as a whole fell short from measuring up to its industry-setting predecessors.To be fair, the story structure wasn't half bad. Everything was accessible and easily entertaining. However, the problem lies in the plot draped over the structure. The whole story was pivoted on ideas and themes that have been honed in once and again by the genre\u2014statue of limitations, family relationships, revenge, that innocent lover, foul-mouthed detectives seeking redemption\u2014and all of them tie together in a rather unoriginal manner. Enough hints were dropped by the first half of the movie for the second half to be a yawn. Of the few twists in the movie, most were fairly interesting, some spotted coming from fifty miles away, but none enough to salvage the movie from what is basically a remix of a remix of staple K-thriller tropes. Not to mention, the ending was anticlimactic to the fiercely dark tone the movie had developed and the script a hodgepodge of trite lines/scenes that multiplied through the runtime.Jung Jaeyoung's performance was fair\u2014given, it isn't an easy task playing a 2D character that has probably shown up in every other mainstream thriller\u2014and Park Sihoo demonstrates that he's still got a long way to go.One saving grace from all of this mediocrity is the action sequences. There were a couple scenes which had been especially creative. Though at some points they suffered from lengthiness, overall they were highly entertaining and it was a pleasure seeing some practical martial arts mixed into the choreography.In no way will Confession of Murder be a milestone in Korean thriller, and it clearly wasn't intended to be all that original, but at least it had met the ruined cars quota for it to be a decent action flick.And by the way, Jeong Byeonggil, your tribute to Park Chanwook has been duly noted.", "8\u2605 Korean-GoodA serial killer, after years of killing, is publishing a book about his doings. All his victim's relatives are willing to put an end on the life of the one that made them suffer. The society is divided between those who consider him a pop star, those who want justice and those there are just there to watch with no real side on this battle. Revenge, hatred, inconvenience and a lot of action. As always, everything is a little exaggerated, but its the Korean style, which I really enjoy. Questions, blame, shame and a plot full of twists, just like they like it.---------------Things I've learned with Confessions of Murder:If you have the chance of killing the guy you want, it's always better to just let him scape. Why I would finish the movie half an hour earlier?If I can head shot of a snake in motion with a crossbow, I can always miss a guy running. Cuz' it's always harder to shoot something bigger.A fire extinguisher can flip a car.", "CONFESSION OF MURDER is the latest in a long line of excellent serial killer flicks from South Korea; some particular highlights of that list are I SAW THE DEVIL, THE CHASER and MEMORIES OF MURDER. This particular outing is slightly more unusual than most in that the actual killings are crimes of the past and thus the murderer is now unable to be brought to justice as something called the \"statute of limitations\" has now expired.However, in all other respects, this is par for the course for the genre. Jae-yeong Jeong (WELCOME TO DONGMAKGOL) plays the hard-bitten detective hot on the trail of a slimy killer (played with relish by Shi-hoo Park) who's now become something of a media personality in a satirical sub-plot poking fun at the modern world's obsession with celebrities.CONFESSION OF MURDER is unwieldy in places in its willingness to throw almost everything into the movie. It kicks off with an electric foot chase reminiscent of THE CHASER and closes with a motorway stunt lifted from TERMINATOR 2. Along the way there's some decent action which riffs on the BOURNE films along with a couple of unwelcome missteps into slapstick comedy.Despite some oddball situations this remains compelling and engaging for the most part. The acting is strong, as is the direction, and the script doesn't disappoint. It's also unusual enough and tells a unique enough story to make it a worthwhile addition to this inventive and suspenseful sub-genre.", "Movie: Confession of Murder (18)Rating: 4.5/5Who doesn't like surprises? Especially the ones in a film? The genres themselves promised surprises in this South Korean action thriller CONFESSION of MURDER starring Jung Jae-young and Park Si-hoo. The film is so unpredictable, smart & intelligent that after watching it, you'll officially salute its makers, especially the one who scripted this masterpiece!CONFESSION OF MURDER is the best of its kind. A film full of thrilling surprises and mindblowing action sequences, it's the perfect South Korean film I had been looking for. It easily proves that films and filmmakers in South Korea are nothing short of being branded as genius. Visually, this film is an absolute masterpiece. The screenplay is the best thing about the film, as you won't have seen or heard such a brilliant screenplay before, ever. The action is another major strength, as are the two lead actors Jung Jae-young and Park Si-hoo: they keep you glued to the screen for the entire duration, and there's not a single moment in which you'll feel bored or distracted. Jung Jae-young delivers a sharp and intense performance, while Park Si-hoo keeps the viewers engaged with his solid expressions.The film is gripping from its very first sequence. From here it won't be difficult to predict that the film's going to be unpredictable. Mark my words: UNPREDICTABLE. And I seriously mean it.CONFESSION OF MURDER benefits a lot from the intelligent and watertight screenplay, but suffers slightly due to the editing, which often slows down the film's pace occasionally. But happily this doesn't happen for long and what you get at the end of the show is a cinematic masterpiece. Full marks to its director and writer Byung-gil Jung for such a well executed film, and a salute as well, for bringing out the best of the two lead actors as well as giving such a great film not only to the Korean but also the world audience.

Unlike other K dramas, the romance doesn't get all cheesy and cute, but stays within reasonable levels, most of the time anyway. Also the love triangle is well managed. The characters change throughout the series, and you grow to like them, then dislike them, then like them again. And that, I think, is the best part about this series and it makes it unique. Also, it keeps the interest high, as, unlike other dramas that the story concludes at about the 14th episode, cheese in the trap keeps it interesting till the end, with a nice final episode that doesn't stick with the patterns of tacky romance. And because of its originality, I think that Cheese in the trap is definitely one of the k dramas to watch.", "I love the story really and I find Hae-Jin's manipulative character very fascinating. Go-Eun's understanding character for Hae-Jin's is another story. I love their chemistry and the flow of the story. The ending is so disappointing though like that's it?

I am demanding for season 2 because I am a viewer seeking for satisfactory", "JUST DON'T TURN BACK BECAUSE YOU READ THE ENDING IS BAD, BECAUSE HONESTLY, ITS PERFECT. AND IT IS A HAPPY ENDING IF YOU'LL SEE THE COMPLETE ENDING. I don't know why did everyone said the ending was bad? I cried the whole episode literally! But I was totally satisfied. It was to realistic. As much as it was about Yu Jong and Seol's love, it was about the growth of their characters. Not just their but Baek In Ha and Baek In Ho too. The story was more realistic than anything that I have ever seen. Honestly, I was all tears the moment I realized he was going to leave her for her own sake but somewhere I understood him probably because I identify my nature with Seol way too much. Just like her, I had hope it will work out and he will come back. Till the very last moment I somehow managed to tell myself that it was fine even if they don't meet because they have grown up and has learnt so much and somehow I managed to put up a smile because of Bak In Ha but I truly broke down into tears the moment I heard \"Seol-a\" in the end. It felt like I got my boyfriend back. I don't why people think the ending isn't good and that it isn't solid enough because if you'll look at it in a different light, the second male lead had a strong character because his story is equally important and thus, the story isn't just a love story or a love triangle, it was about the growth of people who contained their anger, who contained their feelings and who felt alone and never told anyone. The story wasn't about \"LOVE CONQUERS ALL\" it was about \"ACCEPT YOUR TRUE SELF\".I was so happy when Seol hugged Yoo Jong after that Sang Chul incident at the company when the guy had tears in his eyes that was so real. I kind of really think that this someone's real story because you can't nail such emotions so well. Like the way Yoo Jong behaved when Seol first bought gift for him, He was so surprised and touched that he couldn't understand how to react and was so taken aback in his own feelings and then when he hugged her it was just so pure. I really love this drama. I am so happy I got over my feeling of being scared of a sad ending an watched this.", "Frustrates me no end to see that the rating isn't higher for this show.

I would definitely recommend this show to any one who loves a good drama.", "The plot and resolution for this would have been acceptable for a movie, but for an entire TV series it's just too much. If you like watching the lead character make excuses for a psychopath boyfriend who ruins other people's lives for her you may like this; otherwise go watch something else. The writers must like bad things happening to good people, as that's the majority of what happens here.

It was a really fresh idea to place zombies during the Korean middle ages(Joseon era) a direct contrast to most zombie films we see today, located at the modern urban landscape. The decision to do that breaths new life to the so far tired zombie genre.Moreover, what I found incredibly interesting is the \"subtle\" commentary on the extremely hierarchical korean society, which is the actual disease that has consumed the nation. Look no further than where the disease started (the king is patient 0) and the way that the society tries to deal with their dead; seperating the bodies of the rich from those of the poor, giving proper burial to the rich whereas burning the poor. Instead of dealing with the actual situation they choose to focus on formalities even when those can endanger the living. Not only that but the Confucian principles of not harming the body(burning,cutting etc) are only to be applied to the rich. The society is so much plagued with an archaic system of principles and conduct that they fail to see it for what it actually is, the disease itself, in that sense not only the zombies are infected but everyone.Btw no guns and slow zombies in this one like the Walking Dead. Here zombies RUN, no time to waste and the living ones have to use whatever tools they find, mainly tools used in agriculture and farming!In terms of visual aestetics the series looks stunning!

I think it was George A. Romero, who once said that Horror was a way for him to make a social statement and guess this series somehow delivers that in a great way (in one episode there's a strange- and quite actual- discussion on what to do with the bodies of working and high society people). There's also the long and neverending question between slow and fast zombies. After Train to Busan we got a peek to what South Korea seems to prefer, and I'm glad with this, but if you add the fact that these zombies share also some similarities with vampires (the fact that they're scared/damaged by light) it just climb up to other levels of awesomeness. I would like to say that what most attracted me to this series is the fact that the zombie Genre had long been quite unexploited and Kingdom is a rare gem because not only it's an era drama/horror series but also all the things I've stated before. I see it as a genre disruption (which for me is a good thing).", "Has to be one of the best series in 2019 by netflix, I know I know its only january just now. But what a beginning to the year. You cannot miss it. Just wrapped up the season its brilliant all the way through. Beautiful costumes, amazing cinematography , brilliant gore, hints of comedy, good balanced action. Not too much of anything and not too little. Great gripping storyline throughout with an amazing lead role.\nNot a spoiler ***** i died laughing at the head-cuffs scene ***** u'll know when u see it.", "I just finished binge-watching Kingdom. I'll now explain my headline lol. Here is my review. The story takes place during Korea's medieval Joseon period amongst a mysterious plague. The shows pacing is perfect. The acting is impeccable and all the actors and actresses did incredible. The action was absolutely epic af. No exaggeration. Blood and Gore galore. The battles are the Koreans version of GOT. Korean anything in cinema is my absolute favorite. I feel like they reinvent the wheel constantly for outdoing their previous entries all the time and that \"us\" as American Filmmakers can learn a thing or two from them. The money they invested into this show definitely shows with each episode costing a tad more than 1.78 million dollars. The cinematography is to die for literally lol. The shots in both the action scenes and dramatic yet everyday scenes that were filmed are superb. The tension of the shots is evident at every angle. If you never liked reading subtitles prior you need to fix that crap immediately because this show is so worth it. I hope and pray that they make a season two because as it stands this is my favorite show of 2019 and it's only January and this will undoubtedly remain my new favorite show. Netflix was smart to invest in this show. Horror done right. The zombie design was magnificent in the most grotesque way possible lol. The few plot twists they had in season one were definitely unexpected to say the least.", "I waited for a long time for this one and boy it didnt disappoint..great show", "Kingdom on netflix was exciting. Can't wait for season two!", "I only checked this out of curiosity but got pleasantly surprised how good it was and ended up bingeing. Every episode is full of action and there's no dull moment.

This one's a six-part Netflix miniseries that explores a zombie outbreak during the Joseon dynasty. The series is a strong mix of GAME OF THRONES-style political intrigue and plotting with plenty of zombie action; the zombies themselves are fresh and frightening, thanks to some twists with the mythology and 28 DAYS LATER-style speed and ferocity.Netflix have really gone to down with the production values here and many of the visuals are good enough to make framed prints. The scenery and sets look luxurious and the costumes are brought to life in glorious colours. A small but distinctive cast, including Doona Bae, play characters with depth and humanity. In between the zombie attacks there's endless plotting, twisting and oodles of suspense, while the stand-out set-pieces in episodes three and four are among the best I've ever seen.

Expect a lot of over the top humour. Although this series doesn't shy away from drama either but it's not the focus of this series, neither does it follow a specific arc... it's just a funny show about the daily life of an artist.

There's a sci-fi element that makes this series worth watching. The concept is so original and even the love story is compelling. After each episode I couldn't wait to see where the story was going next so of course I ended up binge watching it over the weekend.The acting is great, the production values are top notch, and the characters are very likeable. Even when they do something questionable, you still want to root for them. The main character does some very shady things but that never seems to make him less likeable.

I knew this was for me because I'm so down for Sci-fi series. Usually, there's not much sci-fi in Korean dramas but this one is outstanding. The beginning of the show is so attracting. It hooked me from the first ep.The idea of bringing AR game to real life is brilliant. So creative, you could hardly imagine. Movie pace is pretty slow for viewers to catch things up easily. (I wish it was faster like US shows). They did an overwhelming great job on VFX!!\nThe casts in this drama are good as well (they are famous for their great acting). I'm especially impressed by Chanyeol's acting (plays SeJu).But from Ep.13 til the end, it's full of \"flashbacks\". They put together cutscenes from previous episodes, which is a waste of screen time. It shows they lack of storyline for the ending. And that's why the ending is very disappointing.Could've rated 6/10 but because I love the idea, the VFX, and how they film is really cinematic, so 7/10.", "The story is very unique i've never seen anything like it before ...the one hour episode flies very quickly plus i really love the chemistry between the lead actors", "This is my first K drama and I have to say it did blow my mind at a few occasions, however the hype just petered out as the show progressed. What impressed me the most was the plot development at the beginning, how well the whole story was kicking in and grooving me into it, but the amount of plot holes there were in the story ruined my interest as it went on. The non linear style of direction was certainly eye catching but the repeated use of this for every episode made my it too boring. After the surreal idea of a story, the next best thing about this show would be the actors. Both the leads absolutely nailed their roles. The side characters were also portrayed very well by their actors. And then comes the music of the show. The background music added the perfect amount of intensity and emotion to the scenes, especially the scenes with plot twists and tension. The first part of the show was really worthy of praise. However this was the extent of the positives in this show. One of the biggest problems with the show is the lazy writing of the plot (ironic since the idea of the plot was the best part of the show). At times the plot devices used felt too convenient, like how the male lead just had to be the bug in the game while every other bug in the game, were the characters who diedplaying the game. And nobody knows what happened to the bug of the character Marco. How the male lead had to complete the quest in order to free the creator of the game who put himself in that 'dungeon' while its unexplained as to how the male lead freed himself out of the dungeon when no one else completed the quest to save him. Also how the game was affecting certain characters who played it directly, in real life. It's never told 'convincingly' why certain characters like the main lead and his allies, Dr. cha, Marco and Se ju were having real life injuries and deaths due to the consequences of the game while others users were not. Why only they were able to see the NPCs even after logging out (basically how they were the only ones getting affected by the bug of the game). Why Only few users were killed by the game while many other users still lived even after being defeated (the ones from Seoul). These are only a of the few mistakes I found that were either completely unexplained or were too conveniently told. The other big issue I had with the show were the characters. The female characters felt too one dimensional, lacking any depth in their character. And the female lead's character was confined to an overly worrisome and crying woman. The first ex wife's personality and past were too shallow to form an understanding. And the second ex wife's character felt like her presence was just to spice up the male lead's distraught life, as she was only represented as a meanie and nothing more. The humour in the show was well timed in certain occasions and at the same time, felt too forced in other occasions. The romance felt completely out of the blue and didn't really fit in well in this story(not to mention the repeated use of that same song whenever the female lead was crying in agony). But at the same time, they represented many emotions nicely. So in conclusion, I can say that this show has issues but is still an enjoyable experience if watched with low expectations.", "This is a series where they show you something amazing and explain its mystery little by little.\nIt's about a super realistic Augmented Reality game. It's fun, but there is a problem.\nI'm a technical person myself and I understand they want to keep it mysterious and interesting, but throughout the series I was continually making comments like: A programmer wouldn't do this, this isn't correct, why don't you check the servers, debug your program, ...\nBut the worst part is that the series often violates the logic they created themselves. The first season ended with an open ending leaving many questions unanswered. I wouldn't want to go through a whole second season just to see the unanswered questions answered, since I feel they messed up the \"mystery logic\" too much.\nI would want to see a satisfying ending in the form of a movie tho.", "Hyun Bin, Park Shin Hye and the rest of the cast did a phenomenal job in this brilliant and exhilarating piece.

This girl can show so many emotions and you could tell from your very heart and soul how much her character loves Jin Woo.I hope and pray there's a special episode or a season two for these two.

Every time Hye Kyo had tears in her eyes, she made me cry(and i never cry watching dramas btw).

The whole drama is one dimemsional and is not rich in content. The Cuba setting can just bring excitement for the first two episodes.A foreign setting and a supersar casting is not enough to make a good drama. Especially for this drama Song is older than Park, there will not be many kisses and romantic scenes like typical love drama. I expect the writer would add something special to compensate for the age gap. Like Mr Sunshine the age gap are compensated with beautiful shooting, great war scene, amazing costume.

The story is a bit exaggerated with a mum loses her life because of this. But a bit of exaggeration does keep the story interesting to follow.The supertutor in the story causes the breaking of a family because she malteach tbe son of the family. In reality, this is not too possible. But i would say many of the tutors in my place are doing bad jobs and cause their students' failure to be admitted to universities. These tutors are simply too lazy to perform for what they have been paid, and destroy the futures of their students without any guilt at heart.I hope the supertutor in the drama would be punished because of her deed.Fathers of the families are all acted by familiar faces. The interpreter in Mr Sunshine, the site supervisor in DOTS and the assistant in KMHM. They light up the whole drama with their super acting skill.This drama reminds me of another drama Investigation Couple. A student jumping down from a building because of illusion caused by taking of medication to boost his spirit for studying. The pills are supplied by his mother. Again a tragedy because of unreachable goals on children education.Both drama give reminder to parents not to exert excess pressure on their children.Seeing up to epd 14. below is the updated commentsHye na is the best actor among the lads. She is cunning, full of plan to reocover her identity. Among the mums, writer mum is the worst. Her facial expression has no much difference in every scene.Twin mum's response to her lying daughter is adorable. This forgiving mum is our role model. Character of lads can still be reshaped. It is unwise to be too harsh with their foolishness.2 daughters' mum is too obssessed with academic results of her children, thus making too much compromise for an effective tutor. One thing is that she like to throw water to someone whom she feels doing wrong, including the super tutor. In our society, we believe that we should not make extreme reaction to a person who is obviously wrong or cheating you. This would only arouse unreasonable hatred and retaliation.It is amazing how the writer makes up an education thriller. No beautiful female lead. No handsome male lead. No romance. All are middle aged roles. But still achieve the highest seeing rating in korea. Unfortunately it is not on netfix. Foreign watchers simply miss this fascinating drama.After watching epd 15 and fast forwarding epd 16, i am a bit disappointed with the drama. I feel that the end of the drama is rotten. I have to lower the score from 8 to 7.The plot turn unreasonable. The supertutor is not God. How can she plot the death of hya na and frame woo jin as killer, just being a tutor and has just one assistant. The parent meeting and fight is utterly unnecessary. It makes the series a soap drama.Rumour says that the drama is extended from 16 to 20 epd. That is probably the reason behind why the story suddenly turns unreasonable and elongated illogically.Like Secretary Kim, i just cannot figure out why seeing rate is so high. I hate unresonable storyline my self. Perhaps i am more demanding than average audience. But epd before 15 is perfectly ok. So it still score a rating of 7.Updated\nHappy ending. It is my cup of tea.

It's easy to invest oneself in the protagonist's difficult situation, but the female lead (played by the excellent Hyo-joo Han) is given just as much (if not more) attention in terms of character development. This really taps into the difficulties of dating someone whose appearance changes completely on a daily basis. There's some very good, everyday humor as well \u2013 which makes this film more pleasant than one might think. The bizarre premise allows for a number of different actors and actresses to contribute. Melodramaticism is tempered nicely, with a tone that is very realistic and romantic.The previous IMDb reviewer complained that more ground was not covered by the film, but I felt that the script benefited from maintaining a focus on the relationship between the two main characters - and how the man's \"condition\" affects that relationship. A few other internet reviewers complained that social issues were left unaddressed, but I can only imagine how unbearably preachy that tactic would get.This is based on an American television mini-series.", "First off, consider that aside from these scant reviews the film has a very respectable 7.1 rating from 659 viewers.I've been hooked on K-dramas for some time.

Just viewed the series which has six episodes, some 4 minutes long, so that the total run time is only about 30 minutes. I feel this feature film version is far superior to the mini-series.I so enjoyed most all aspects of the film that I immediately watched it a second time. Interestingly there is no single male lead actor. The female lead, Yi Soon, was spot on perfect. The hook: How can any relationship get off the ground, let alone succeed, when the guy Yi Soon meets will look like a virtual stranger (man/old man/young woman/old woman/child/handsome/ beautiful/ ugly) every day.I love how the film tackles Woo Jin's (male lead)logistical challenges i.e. different shoe sizes, eyesight good to awful, clothes, hair, make-up etc. etc.Very good screenplay which rises to the challenges.

He changes into any human, various ages and nationalities to different sexes. But there is something that is the same about him, his character, personality and his name.

The only problem is that she is as pretty as a model and it is hard to suspend your disbelief to think she could be single at 29.", "I wanted to check this movie out mainly because of the premise. The trailer didn't give away much, but I thought the premise seemed interesting. Which was about a guy that has a different face and body each time he wakes up. I was wondering how they were going to go about this premised. Well it turned out to be a a romance movie about a guy that changes physically every time he sleeps. And I will say, besides the guy changing physically every time he sleeps, this is a very very very generic romance movie. The lead actress in this is Han Hyo-joo who I wasn't really a fan of. Let's just say even after watching this, she still didn't stand out to me. I think she should stick to being in old historical films and movies. This movie started off pretty promising, but the most drawn out and least interesting part started when the lead character hooks up with the girl. There was thousand of different possibilities this movie could have gone, but it chose to most boring and generic route possible. There was no emotional impact, even during scenes where they tried to bring it out from the audience. I just simply didn't care. Also besides the supernatural part about this movie, the interactions and direction just seemed so far-fetched and not believable. I guess the story is about how it's more about the inner beauty over the outer beauty, but it falters.

The idea of waking up every day in a new body is intriguing and offers all sorts of possibilities. Will you inherit the psychological features that accompany the physical features? If you wake up looking like a gangster, will you equally be surly? Or if you wake up as an old woman, do you have the physical problems? You get the idea. An endless list of interesting and potentially funny or touching scenes, almost none of them examined in this film. Instead, regardless of how he looks, Woo-Jin wakes up as the same basic person. Yet even this contrivance is violated because we rarely get a look at a consistent person inside all the physical changes.The one good aspect of the film is Woo-Jin's girlfriend played by Hyo-ju Han, and his best friend (Lee Dong=hwi) Han is delightfully delicate and hwi is delightfully obnoxious.(Note : Apparently this film is based on a 2012 mini-series that I didn't see)", "First of all I understand some negative reviews. Indeed many possibilities are disregarded but this is not the message of this film. The movie primarily focus on a relationship or a possible relationship with someone who every day physically is a different person. Is it possible? Is the way we look so important to us? I like how by the end the movie shifts perspective. This is very typical to Korean cinema so I wasn't that surprised. There are always at least two versions of the same story and we get a chance to see them both.\nIt is also one of the very few movies where adding the voice over/narrator makes a perfect sense. Simply because we get used to the sound of his voice so we get at least one chance to be familiar with the protagonist. Something that the main heroine will never get.", "If you watch this, I think you definitely bring the recent 'The Cobbler', 'The Deaths of Ian Stone' and many other high-concept films into the frame. Yep, it had a zero innovation, but smartly redesigned to bring a different outcome. Actually, it was based on the online film/series (aka social film) of the same name and also heard it was very similar to the book 'Every Day' by David Levithan. My thought is, it did not stand up to my expectation, but very easy to follow and overall, I think it was not a bad movie.If you are a fantasy film fan, then you should try it. A very fascinating fictional movie, that associated with romance. That means it's not your regular emotional-romantic-drama from Korea, but well pitched over all the complication in a relationship when a person is suffering from such a strange disorder. Just like the films 'The Time Traveler's Wife', '50 First Dates' and other similar ones about relationship problems.The first one hour was so good, like everything happened in that period itself. From a simple introduction to a few of fun stuff, until the romance track takes over. The next half was kind of a drag, none any interesting events take place other than keep going blindly like it lost its way out. In those stages, most of the scenes would appear as you are anticipating. Somewhat weaken its strength in storytelling. Since this theme was atypical, on that basis, it makes a vast difference to keep us to stick with it.\"People say true beauty lies inside, but first impressions are equally important.\"Anyway, once you begin to watch an unusual love story like this, definitely you can't end it in the middle without knowing the conclusion. I feel, the end was okayish, no twist as you will know in the earlier itself, where it is heading. So nothing special at all, but it finishes it off quite a simple way. The only annoyance is that it was a 2 long hour movie, should have not exceeded more than 90 to 100 minute mark. What I'm saying is not an issue of falling into the boredom, but a stretch that should have remained short and sweet for a lovely film like this.The actors were excellent, but the interesting thing among them was those who are all played the most important role, Woo-Jin. I have seen plenty of high-concept flicks, but I have never seen so many actors (definitely more than 100 actors) playing a same role in a one movie. The appearance was kept changing, but the director did a good job to keep them all at the same pace and intensity to bring Woo-Jin as a single character in behaviour.These days, there's a high expectation for the movies coming out from the Korea. There are vast people around the world who follow either staggering crime-thriller or the sweet romantic- comedies from this region. I know when they take this up, they expect it to better Hollywood and European films. In that perspective, it will disappoint them, because I felt it was a great concept that fell into an ordinary for a few reasons. If you keep your mind narrow, then it might make your time worth spending for it. Personally, I liked it, but my only concern was the third act and a bit lengthy.6\u00bd/10", "The Korean man who directed this movie made a big splash at Cannes? I haven't heard that piece of news yet, but surely it was an interesting film. This romantic love story will positively make young people want to fall in love with somebody. It is an important message to young generations since I've heard people rarely fall in love nowadays. Being in love is thought of as wasting time and money it maybe that there are some substitutes, 2jigen \u4e8c\u6b21\u5143\u3001two-dimensional girls/boys, therefore people don't need real women/men anymore. That's what I've heard, and that it is one of the big social problems with contributing to the declining birth rate in Japan. It was such a romantic and freaky film that would never occur in real life, but the funny thing was that all the reactions the people have taken and what happened to the others except the leading characters were all too normal like a real life situation. For example, Yi-soo is a pretty woman who fell in love with Woo-jin, being well aware of his weird disease that his face transforms to any kind of face daily; her mental condition worsen as the time passes. She has hard time getting used to it and having anguished days. Also there has been a bad rumor that Yi-soo is such a slutty woman that she has been dating with a different guy everyday, and that she doesn't even hesitate to do so. The rumor depressed her, but I wonder why she would care about such a rumor. If she had not had a real resolution on her part, she would have never been able to meet Woo-jin outside where they might be witnessed by colleagues. This part was one of the contradictions I found in the story. This kind of highly improbable situation is such a hard thing to keep up with that only those who either are numb in their sensitivity or who are well in anticipation of now and then should deal with, and that she should only get in touch with him once a week or so and should take it only as a special matter besides her everyday's normal life. If a woman of her fragility come to this situation, and get involved too much, she'd definitely die by mental disorder. By the way, Woo-jin is a genius upholsterer, who mainly creates original custom-made woodworks. They were so beautiful. Just looking at all those furniture Woo-jin made, I get full of joy since I love wooden furniture so much! The actress, Hyo-ju Han is beautiful. Her type of woman is hardly seen in Japan for some reason. She is one romantic girl that I found her befuddled look so breathtakingly beautiful. She was also a skillful actress that acted fragile and elegant woman in the film. Another point to notice is that \"Yi-soo\", the girl's name means \"chair\" \u6905\u5b50 in Japanese I believed was not a pun, but could be a pun since Ueno Juri\u4e0a\u91ce\u6a39\u91cc(Nodame, my icon), a Japanse actress was starring in the film as one of the Woo-jin's most important transformers. In this context, the director could be said to be a Japanophile. Maybe or maybe not.", "While this remake remain true to the English versiom for the first hour of the film, I find it refreshing that they look at the psychological impact on carrying this kind of secret in a relationship. Also forces us to face reality...which most of us are taught, that beauty should not be skin deep, but how does a person really love another person.", "The concept of the movie is very new, yet I would only give it a 7 - 8. It's beautiful and decent. No drama. No third wheelers. Just two people meeting, falling, struggling then learning to embrace their happiness.However, I still give it a 10. Partly, because Han Hyojoo smoothly transformed into her character. It's not a difficult role, but she's my favorite actress so I guess I can be quite biased. But the main reason why I give it a 10 is due to the cinematography. Shots are taken in the angles that can capture the perfect light and perfect scenes, giving it a dreamy, heaven-like feels, sometimes even very picturesque. The color of the film is of a vintage beige tone that matches my type perfectly.", "South Korea is no stranger to putting some really good and entertaining movies out there, and \"The Beauty Inside\" (aka \"Byuti insaideu\") is definitely a movie that fits into that description.Now, I wasn't familiar with the movie or its storyline prior to happen to come across it by sheer luck, and of course with my love for the Asian cinema I just had to give it a go. And I am very glad that I did, because \"The Beauty Inside\" turned out to be a rather interesting and beautiful movie.The story in all its simplicity is Woo-Jin who wakes up every day in a different body; a change that spans both gender, nationality and age. One day he may be a Japanese middle aged man, only to wake up as an African teenage girl the next, and so on and so on. He falls in love with a salesperson at a local furniture vendor, and lets her in on the secret of his life, and she falls in love with him in return.The storyline is quite different and unlike anything I have ever seen before, and that really was a great and refreshing change of pace. The storyline in \"The Beauty Inside\" is nicely paced and really well composed by writers Seon-jeong Kim, Jeong-ye Park and Kyung-hee Noh. And director Jong-Yeol Baek really brought the story to life so well on the screen.\"The Beauty Inside\" has a very expanded list of actors and actresses, most of which portray the Woo-Jin character. I will say that this diversity was really well handled by the numerous actors and actresses that performed in the movie.While the storyline is beautiful and touching, then I don't see this as a movie that you will be likely to watch more than a single time.

A guy wakes up every morning in a new body, whether that's a woman, man, child, elder or even foreigner (in which case he has to talk in the language of the body's nationality). He tries to make the best out of his situation, when he falls in love with a girl who sales furniture. But his strange condition makes it nearly impossible to date her, let alone make her fall for him, as he changes faces every day. The theme, as I said, it's interesting and entertaining. Though, I couldn't help it but await for the guy's condition to eventually (miraculously) change. But, as the hero says (short of), love can change things but can make things difficult as well. The girl was amazing in her performance, as she displayed perfect chemistry with each actor that played her partner. Plus, some of the actors were really good (exapmle, the girl who performed the scene where the mother confesses her secret to her son). Still, however, it felt like it needed something more, maybe some twist or something more powerful. But all in all, a nice love story, so 7 out of 10.", "The concept of this movie is really unique and interesting, so the narration at the very beginning helps the audience understand the extent of Woojin's condition. All of the characters treated Woojin realistically enough, but it initially felt like Yisoo was too easily accepting. I continued feeling this way until close to the end of the film.Yisoo was so kind and open-minded throughout almost the entirety of the movie, to the point where it seemed like Woojin was being too selfish and taking her kindness for granted. But it made sense, seeing as Woojin seemed to have this insecurity to the point he blamed a lot of things on Yisoo.Woojin's best friend, Sangbaek, was a fun addition to the movie and had the most practical, realistic perspective.I valued the ending the most because it finally revealed that Yisoo was struggling to deal with Woojin's condition too and how it eventually took a significant toll on her mental health. So much so that she even decided to leave him. Of course, as someone who liked the leads' relationship dynamic, I wanted them to be together but I liked that Yisoo was honest with herself and Woojin, rather than continuing to disregard and hide her feelings. Because she left, it felt more rewarding when the leads got back together at the end.", "1. One the most powerful scenes in the history film is the blackout scene in HERE COMES MR. JORDAN.

Mind putting 1 more coin to call the cops? No you do not call them. You tell someone on the road to call the cops? Nope ! You go to your house where the bad lady is in. At the entrance there are people. You tell them to call the cops? No you don't. The cops are at the entrance because they found a dead body. You inform them ? No again. You go in your house. You are in the kitchen. There are like 10 knives. Do you want to be wolverine ? No bare hands are better. You are again in the kitchen. 10 knives in front of you but yeah just take the lighter cause yeah it is obviously a better choice. You are the wife. You manage to hit the bad lady barely unconscious.

The guy is a super wimp. Nothing against guys that are physically weak. But the guy was so annoying to watch on screen. Even his wife and kids have more balls than him. No wonder why girls dislike wimpy guys that can't fend for themselves. Now the character decisions. Sure, when it comes to horror movies there is usually a lot of characters that make some really bad decisions. But since the characters are frantic all the way through while making really bad decisions which made it even more annoying.

The driver who hit the car, actually aimed at killing both father and child, however the main actress was present and even though she was intimidated into not going to court to testify whether the accident was no accident, she did go.

Just reading a review and the synopsis of it made me want to watch it. It's mostly about inner beauty which is the most important thing. It doesn't matter how beautiful you look on the outside, it's whats inside that counts and that's the moral of this show. It teaches us lessons that we can use in life especially in this day and age. I highly recommend it, only plight was two annoying characters that try to cause trouble for our main leads. Other than that it's really enjoyable and if you enjoy dramas this is worth watching."], "101": ["Your Honor is a law drama with an interesting plot about twin brothers that change places in a way. Of course the performances were great, and therefor the shots with the \"twins\" were nicely made and the producers pulled it off without making it cheap. Also, some cases were entertaining. In addition, the family drama was intense and explained in depth. Though, the drama was weak at some points. For exaple, the criminal twin took his brother's place with no knowledge about how to be a judge and he actually pulled it off without raising suspicions. Also, the drama got a bit boring at times. But, overall, it was enjoyable."], "102": ["About time introduces the viewer with a new concept, the ability to see your time of death.

And it did. Unfortunately, the musical parts were tiring, the story started getting boring and the twists were just too predictable to entertain. Those things killed the romance, that was so strong and emotional at first.

The romance was very cute, as the couple had chemistry. Also, the characters were entertaining and funny and the actors did a great job potraying them.

Very interesting script. Kudos to the entire team.\nEvery scene was so crisp, did not find any scene boring in all the 32 episodes. Very few scenes were a little\nI loved the fact that unlike most serials which would end with episode 30, this serial will always stand out for producing episode 31 and 32.", "Well, how about \"wonderful\" ? or even a simple \"wow\" ? Please let me expand/explain....\nSince I started watching K Drama about 7 months ago, I've gradually wondered if I'll ever get to see a perfect show. A ten out of 10, if you will.\nYes, I've seen the acknowledged fan favourites ( Weightlifting Fairy, Secretary Kim, I'm Not a Robot, W, Strong Woman ) and though there is brilliance in all of them, none warrants a perfect score.\nI don't use the word \"euphoria\" very often regarding the media ( probably, for TV, during the heyday of the sublime \"Breaking Bad\" ) but It's certainly apt for how I feel about \"30 But 17\". Entwined with that feeling is the emotional impact : I find myself thinking of certain scenes and tearing up because they're so well written/acted. Basic equation : Great Art = Exhilaration !\nI recall trying to watch \"Sister Is Alive\" recently & giving up after 2 episodes because most of the characters were horrible. With \"30 But 17\", all the main cast are lovely & it's so enjoyable to spend time with them.\nPivotal to everything is the charming & wonderful Shin Hye Sun as the talented young violinist Seo Ri, stuck in a horrific traffic accident who wakes from a coma at the age of 30 with her youth stolen and a virtual orphan. Yes, the scenario is somewhat manipulative yet the story is intriguing and touching nonetheless. It's a truly heart-breaking yet nuanced performance and I constantly wanted to reach through the screen and give her a hug ! The boy who might've saved her but for random chance is unfairly devastated by guilt from then on, though when she re-enters his life he has no idea of who it really is and Yang Se Jong as the adult man is equally great as poor Mr Gong. It does hurt when he speaks to her harshly early on yet we know why and don't hate him. He's in a zombie-like coma of sorts, and to see him come out of his shell as his affection for her deepens is profoundly satisfying.\nSuperb support cast ? Check ! Ahn Hyo Seop as Gong's nephew Chan is sweet and caring with a huge heart ( his 2 rowing friends are also good value ); Ye Ji Won is terrific as Jennifer the eccentric housekeeper & even Seo Ri's musical rival is not the one-dimensional horror she might've been in another show. And....the people playing the leads as teenagers are delightful.\nThat said, the script is the engine that drives any movie or TV show and this one is extremely impressive on various levels. Pacing/symmetry is tip-top. It's also very creative, skilful and thoughtful in terms of action & dialogue and carefully building the central relationship. Many scenes are supremely memorable ( eg Choco Pie, onions, fountains, Seo Ri \"moving out\" to name just a few ), plus there's ample humour & a pleasing affection for the joy of music. There are feints and trickery, and I was pleasantly surprised with the choices made in certain scenes. Above all, I felt that the writers really loved the characters and I'm sure the actors responded to that. Much love flows from many scenes and the sight of Seo Ri's surrogate \"family\" taking shape is a sight to see and cherish.\nTISSUE WARNING ! chances are very good that you will cry; I cried a lot, since many of the events are sad yet some have a positive impact too. Anyway, fans of K Drama know full well that you have to go through Hell before you get to Heaven. And though the inevitable tsunami of revelations in the final third produces an ocean of tears, it's bearable because the main couple's, um, \"love boat\" is seaworthy ( anyone for an aquatic metaphor ? sorry ! ) & you know they can handle anything.\nNow, having built my Cathedral of Praise, I do have ( sigh ) a couple of very small complaints. The gorgeous ex-model Jung Yoo Jin ( so under-used in \"W\" & suits, please give her a show of her own ! ) does a good job here as CEO Kang, yet could've done SO much more. We see her dismounting from a big motor bike on one occasion ( such fertile ground for development ! ) so make her cute young assistant have a crush on her. Maybe he comically fantasises about rescuing her from a bunch of thugs or cooking her a lavish dinner ? Or, dressed in tight pants or shorts, she might get off that bike & toss her hair in sexy slo-mo, then we see him removing his helmet in slo-mo with just a little scooter next to him. Why not even have them discover a shared interest & start real dating ? Chan's big solo swim race also annoyed me slightly because I wanted him to put his cocky opponent DOWN ! And you don't really need words : just let him offer a little sly smile when he's taunted & follow it with a wink. But, I should mention the tech side as a balance, since the show is nicely shot and quite beautiful at times ( thanks DP ). So, my gripes are obviously minor flaws & I'm feeling a bit disloyal now !\nAlright, time for some more acclaim ! I'm so grateful to the cast & crew for creating this excellent show. A beautiful work of art can be admired for its construction and for the way it connects with our emotions. This one combines both. When you're down and thinking, \"what's the point ?\", art like \"30 But 17\" can bring real pleasure and make a difference to someone's life.\nBack to the \"P\" word I used at the start ( & don't worry, I'm almost done ! ). I suppose I can't really award a 10 by traditional measures ( those little gripes, argh ! but I'll go with a 9.9 ), yet this is most definitely a towering achievement and I do urge you to watch it. True, I've made this review an epic but we excitable humans have to spread the word when we fall in love. And at a time when the Internet allows brave, anonymous idiots to revel in being cruel and vicious, I think there should be a place for something positive that's from the heart.", "I really enjoyed this drama. The story is REALLY interesting and to my suprise it was way more suspensful than I expected it to be. I was sitting on the edge of my chair sometimes because of excitement.Regardless I got a tiny little bit bored because I felt like the story wasn't really moving on. You'll find out about everything at the VERY end. This drama has a slowly developing story which makes it suspensful on the one hand and sluggish on the other hand. So if you're looking for something fast and short, this is not it.The characters were all so likable, the actors had amazing chemistry and their performances were just great. It's really hilarious, I laughed out loud so many times and it had me replaying some scenes over and over again.\nThe romance was very cute and genuine. Really good character development.The only thing I really didn't enjoy that much was the end for many reasons. It felt rushed and weak and unfortunately left me with a bad impression because it's the most recent and last part you will watch.However I really recommend this drama if you're looking for something light and REALLY funny. 8/10.", "I really enjoyed this drama to the point where I felt some kind of withdrawal when it was over, mainly because I was attached to the characters. Indeed, all of them are sooo likable, especially Chan (I loved him). It was funny, entertaining and I really found that the characters were having chemistry - all of them. The couple was great together, and their connection felt genuine. Because of that, I cried a lot during this drama, but I also had my fair share of laughs. I recommend it if you are looking for something light, funny and cute.P.S. : Try not to have a crush on Mr. Gong..."], "105": ["Risky romance is a medical drama with no medical cases. The story like to focus on the relationship between the two protagonist and to built a romance that didn't really make sense. The male lead was too violent and childish, making it hard to imagine him with the girl. His condition, moreover, was used only when needed and they just forgot about it when it wasn't aiding the plot development. The ending, in addition, was rushed and didn't conlude everyones' stories well. At least this drama wasn't boring to watch."], "106": ["This is one of the best films I've seen in my life, with beautiful cinematography, excellent acting, and most importantly, a great script. It's sad to see that some of you are too busy critiquing the lack of complexity in the plot, because it is this simplicity that makes this movie so beautiful. Since many of you have already reiterated the plot, i'll just cut the chase and try to clear up some confusion, hopefully.First of all, to understand why he let the girl go and turns against his boss, the flashback towards the end is very crucial. When she plays the cello, he smiles, and as he is dying, he smiles as he listens to her voice. These are the only two occasions in which he smiles throughout the entire movie. Whether this is love, attraction, or because he was thankful that she made him feel good, is open to interpretation. Given that he is an extremely straightforward and honest character(and also given that in this movie, everything is what you see on the screen- there are no hidden motives, twists, whatsoever), I assume that the reason he doesn't answer (or CAN'T answer) when asked why he did it by his boss is because he doesn't know himself. I think the key to understanding this movie is the title, and the narration at the end of the movie (something along the line of a disciple telling his master that he cries after a sweet dream because he knows it can't come true). For Sunwoo,the girl and his belief(?) that he can kill everyone else and still live are sweet dreams that cannot come true. The reason why he unrealistically gets by after getting shot and stabbed so much, is not simply because he is the main character, but because everything he does after meeting the girl is like a sweet 'dream', a surreal reality(yes, an oxymoron, just like the title- a 'bittersweet' life). The morbid ending is also very fitting- as sweet as the dream was, the more bitter it is when he \"wakes up\" from it and faces reality(once again relating to the last narration).", "This masterpiece comes from the director of Tales of Two Sisters and he delivers an epic tale of revenge.I can't urge you enough to see this movie. The gun battles are reminiscent of Scarface, the martial arts are gritty and realistic, the poignancy of unrequited love is painful, there is a deep philosophical current that underlies this film, and the camera work is superb-but that's not what carries the movie. The actor who plays the main character is what sets this magnificent movie apart from the trash put out by Hollywood. He's a man's man-sharply dressed in well tailored suits driving in a BMW sedan (like the transporter)through beautiful Seoul (showing what a beautiful, spotless, and vibrant city it is). He reaches the point of no return and his vengeance and determination are a tour de force.Magnificent. Bravo. South Korean films reign supreme.", "I could sit here and start this review off any number of ways to make this film sound ultra important. I could say, once in a great while a film comes along, blah, blah. Or, Only a select few films ever have reached this, blah, blah. Or I could say, if you see one movie this year, blah, blah. You know the drill. These are the opening sentences the big-boy critics use when they really want you to see a flick and when they want a particular review to really stand out. Well, films that deserve this kind of \"special\" praise really do only come around once in a great while. Unbelievably, I have seen two in only six months time. The first was what I like to call the first real 21st Century film, and that was Oldboy. And the second film of this status also comes from Korea, believe it or not, and it is Bittersweet Life.Bittersweet Life is probably one of the most simple, most streamlined modern films I have ever seen. It is lean, mean, and like its lead male, a damn ruthless fighting machine. The film beats along with its Raymond Chandler-like screenplay with all the jazz and style of early 90's John Woo and with the energy and themes of Quentin Tarantino's grind house 70's. Life plays with your emotions, making you care for the bad-guy hero even though he is a vicious killer, and causes one to release tension through laughter when the blood starts gushing like a dozen ruptured fire hoses. Wholesale death, blood by the gallons, broken bones and multiple beatings with humongous pipe-wrenches, two-by-fours, and lead pipes are on order, right after a heaping dish of innocent love and a guy trying for once to do the right thing.The plot, well you see, it's like this: you can see everything coming a mile away, the movie plays it straight, and follows the exact path you know it will and the exact path you hope it will. There are no twist endings, no complicated triple crosses, no hidden motives for the characters. Everything on screen happens the way you see it, and everything thing ends exactly the way you picture it. And this is a good thing. The film is so on track that it doesn't need a twist or a swerve to make you pay attention. It starts at A, ends at E, and hits B, C and D on the way there. Life is so steeped in its genre tropes of noir character and themes that the ending is know to all of us before it even starts. However, it's the journey that matters, and I'll be damned if you can find a better-looking, more brutally violent journey anywhere.As much as I try to analyze the film, nothing comes to mind. And this is the purest of all compliments. The film is as shallow as the pools of blood splattered in the hallways, alleyways and run down exteriors of the sets. Often times a director feels the need to bog a simple story down with twists, and a deeper meaning to hide the fact that they are afraid to just let things happen because they need to happen. Bittersweet Life is not one of these films. It exists with its soul laid bare for all to see, and when the carnage is complete, you thank the film for being honest with itself. As the final credits roll you might find yourself asking, \"Is that it?\" Yes, that is it\u0097cinematic perfection. It is all it needs to be: pure and simple, boisterous and calm, bloody and drenched in gore and an honest movie with nothing to hide. --genrebusters", "This is my first review on here, only because I felt compelled to tell someone about this film\u0085 When I say \"coolest,\" I don't mean it in a that-movie-was-really-cool kind of way\u0085 Coolest, in this case, means that it is the smoothest, well-crafted, stylish, and beautiful films I have ever seen. Everything about the film has a you'll-never-be-this-cool feel, like Jules and Vincent from Pulp Fiction. Not to mention the fact that it has the same sort of humor.Now, I am a film student who has actually gotten a lot of praise from students and teachers and whatnot for my first film project\u0085 That's great and all, but after seeing this film I am reminded of what Steven Spielberg said after he saw The Godfather; \"I guess I should quit now, because I will never make something this good.\" I am, in no way, comparing myself to Spielberg, I'm just describing the feeling of, \"holy s***, this is amazing,\" and \"wow, I could never do this ever\u0085\"See this movie before you die\u0085 Or before it gets remade.", "For director Kim Jee-woon, humor is a basic element of films. And he says no matter how dark and moody it may seem, his new film ''A Bittersweet Life (Talkomhan Insaeng)\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af is no exception.''This movie basically deals with relationship breakups resulting from small communication breakdowns,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af Kim said during a news conference Monday after the preview screening of ''A Bittersweet Life.\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af Without calling it comedy exactly, sometimes audiences have to laugh at very serious or ironic situations, Kim said.Kim has shown his unique morbid sense of humor in previous movies such as ''The Quiet Family,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af a black comedy about a family who kill visitors to their cottage, ''The Foul King,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af a comic drama about an amateur wrestler, and one horror contribution work for the omnibus film ''Three.\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af Kim is also behind ''A Tale of Two Sisters,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af the psychological horror film that became a summer hit in 2003.''A Bittersweet Life,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af starring Lee Byung-hun from ''Everybody Has a Little Secret\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af and Shin Mina from ''Madeleine,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af portrays the desperate and brutal revenge of Sun-woo (played by Lee) after he is expelled from his gang and comes close to being killed by his boss.Lee Byung-hun is a hit-man who falls for the girlfriend of his boss in the stylishly violent \u00a1\u00b0A Bittersweet Life.\u00a1\u00b1 Conventional ideas of causation are put into doubt in director Kim Jee-woon's twist on film noire. ''A Bittersweet Life (Talkomhan Insaeng)'' is what Korean critics are describing as ''Action Noire.'' In it, he tweaks the traditional Korean gangster story line, presenting a work with film noire undertones and stylish cinematography.Sun-woo (Lee Byung-hun) is a revenging dark angel dressed in black. Gang leader Kang (Kim Young-cheol) assigns Sun-woo, his right-hand man, to watch after his nubile girlfriend/professional cellist Hee-soo (Shin Mina) while he is away and find out about the other guy with whom he suspects she is messing around.The plot is complicated by Sun-woo's existential decision to stray from the explicit instructions with which he is charged. He is cryptically told time and again to make good on a promise, but he never exactly know what that is.Much of the action occurs in the long shadows the sprawling megapolis Seoul casts. Here, the gangsters wish they were too cool to be killed. No friend can really be trusted as the good guys are not so good and the bad guys can be down right evil. Importantly, the motivation of his tormentors is shrouded in mystery.But the movie has been labeled ''action noire'' for a good reason. The stylistic ultra-violence of director Kim is superb. The creepy fisherman killer represents a unique Korean twist on the classic film noire villain. Our hero is not a good, good guy either, and I loved that about him. He is not only tough, but also a stone-face killer _ a tribute to both the director and actor's character interpretation.After all, gangsters should fight to kill, and that means sometimes going for the knees and other joints, hitting low and dirty to take the guy out quick. In general, the fight scenes were creative. Watch for the face-dragged-across-the-cinderblock-wall scene, perhaps a first for cinematic violence.", "I had the luck to watch this gem at the Fantasy-Film-Festival in Frankfurt yesterday. It was shown in a theater with about 600 seats and against my expectations the room was packed with people.In comparison with Oldboy or Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance the story is not as deep and goes more straightforward to the pure revenge theme. But this does not make the movie less enjoyable. The cinematography is brilliant and the main-character delivers a great performance. It contains beautifully choreographed martial-arts and gunfight scenes with references to masterpieces like Taxi Driver and Kill Bill. Despite the fact it is very harsh in some scenes the humor does not come to short. The scene with a discussion of Korean-Russian wannabe-gangsters made me nearly wet my pants.", "I had the opportunity to watch this brilliant movie at home, while translating it from English to Greek for the viewers of the Thessaloniki Film Festival in November, 2005.I was impressed by the stunning performance of the leading actor, as well as of the other actors. The music of the film was also wisely selected.Some -few- funny moments in the film help the viewer lighten up and get ready for what I saw as brilliantly directed fighting scenes, that neither bored me nor made me look away.At the end of the film, when the desciple was crying for \"a dream that can never come true\" I was absolutely sure that what I saw was nothing less than a true work of art.", "Everything is believable, from the small things like the way in which the main character first falls in love with his boss's girlfriend because of the delicate curve of her neck and the way the main character fumbles with a gun for the first time while he tries to put it together, to the theme of revenge that this films is propelled by.The main character (Sun-Woo) has lived most of his life serving his 'Hyong-Nim' (Korean for boss in the gangster underworld). He has in fact dedicated 7 years of his life to him, taking care of the dirty work his dirty work. His boss (Mr.Kang) sees Sun-Woo as one of his most trusted 'Ah-Ho' (Korean for underling), and this is where you recognised that family-based element of the gangster underworld. In Korea, the society is largely based on a strict hierarchal system, where you must respect your elders and demand respect from people younger than you. Although right now, Korea is slowly moving away from convention and traditions, the underworld of gangs stills strictly upholds this hierarchal system. The theme of revenge stems from this, as Mr.Kang feels like a betrayed father, with his underling, Sun-Woo protects his boss's girlfriend from getting caught cheating. Mr. Kang follows the protocol of the underworld and decides to punish Sun-Woo who has been like a son to him. Before Sun-Woo suffers the punishment, Mr.Kang asks him why did he betray him, to which Sun-Woo replies, \"I thought if she promised never to cheat on you, everything would be back to normal... I thought everything would be OK.\" To this, Mr.Kang says, \"No, its OK, tell me the truth... It's because you fell for her, isn't it?\" Sun-Woo cannot lie as he stays silent, confused. As he kneels down in the mud in this scene, you see on the main characters face the realisation that after all this time of never falling in love with anyone, the one girl that turned his head was his boss's girlfriend. Earlier in the movie, there is a scene where Mr.Kang and Sun-Woo have dinner together as father and son in a family of the underworld, where Mr.Kang says that he hates being lied to and that if Sun-Woo caught his young girlfriend cheating, that Sun-Woo should kill her. Mr.Kang contradicts himself here, as he is in fact married with a wife who he is cheating on by being with this new younger girlfriend. Mr.Kang believes that in the underworld of gangsters, if your boss says something and he is wrong, you must still agree and follow his lead. There is a Japanese gangster saying, \"If your boss says black is white and white is black, you must agree. If he says there is no sky, then to you there is no sky.\" Mr.Kang punishes Sun-Woo for what he says is betrayal of the code of master and disciple hierarchy. Sun-Woo almost loses his life as he refuses to be punished, fighting against gangsters that he was once the general of. This is where the main character's 'Hamlet-styled' contemplation of revenge takes place. As the story shows the audience Sun-Woo breaking away from tradition and convention by refusing punishment set down by his elder, we also see the main character breaking away from the tradition of close quarter combat as he tries to acquire firearms. To the main character, his boss's actions confuse him. Sun-Woo spent 7 years of his life serving Mr.Kang, and in the final scene Sun-Woo confronts Mr.Kang with this fact. Sun-Woo screams, \"I rotted away serving you for 7 years! Were you really going to kill me?!\" To Sun-Woo, Mr.Kang's actions were too severe. Ironically, this time its Sun-Woo asking Mr.Kang \"No, its OK, tell me the truth... Tell me why you really tried to kill me.\" At this moment, we see that Mr.Kang chose to punish Sun-Woo, not because he wanted to uphold the law of the underworld, but because he was simply jealous of Sun-Woo, of Sun-Woo's youth. Mr.Kang's reason for cheating on his own wife with a younger woman may also suggest Mr.Kang's thirst for youth. Sun-Woo points pistol at his own boss, his father his mentor and I truly expected him not to fire, but I was totally wrong. As Mr.Kang's character may symbolize tradition and convention, Sun-Woo strikes him down as a unpredictable force of chaos and revolution. The way in which we try and control our lives could be seen as the convention of the hierarchal system where humans try to uphold peace and order. Through the main character, this story depicts how bullshit the 'system' is and that life can prove to be utter chaos the more we try to control it and bring order to it. The most powerful scene in this movie I thought was really breathtaking was the final scene where after having been shot numerous times and barely breathing, the main character calls the girl he has recently fallen for. As she picks up, he drops the phone and can only hear her voice. Comforted only by her voice saying \"Yeo Boh Sae Yo?\" (Korean way of asking who is it on the phone) he looks up to see wind blowing in the leaves of a tree. He then seems to be lost in a dream, in his final moments of living. But then his dream is cut very shot, ALL OF A SUDDEN by a single shot to his head. It almost as if he was dreaming and then woke up to see his life, to see nothing.", "Sun-Woo is the manager of sleek modern restaurant in uptown Seoul called La Dolce Vita, but that's not his only employment. He is also the errand-boy of underworld Kingpin Mr Kang. A job he fulfils ruthlessly and efficiently, until the day Mr Kang takes off for a week, leaving Sun-Woo to mind his much younger girlfriend Hee-Soo to make sure she doesn't sleep around. If she does, he is to execute both of them. Hee-Soo cheats. Sun-Woo almost sentences them to death, but has a sober moment and realises that letting them go is the right thing to do.In Mr Kang's absence a rival crime syndicate, headed by President Baek and his over-confident son is becoming more and more impatient to force a business merger with Kang. Despite Kang's reluctance to go through with this deal one of his own men, Sun-Woo's cohort, Min-Gi welcomes the business with Baek and his son and complicates matters.Upon Kang's return he figures out Sun-Woo's failure to carry out his orders and demands he be killed unless he apologises. At this moment, Sun-Woo is about to be tortured to death by Baek Jr. but is returned to Kang on the promise that he will do business.It's out of the frying pan and into the deepest pits of fiery hell for Sun-Woo. Already bashed and bruised and beaten he is cast down in the mud during a heavy rainstorm and forced to apologise. He resists. His hand is crushed with a massive wrench he is buried alive.He survives and breaks through the loose soil. Sun-Woo and the audience breathe a sigh of relief. But it's far from over. Min-Ji and a large group of thugs are still waiting by the shallow grave. They drag him into a old building and give him 15 minutes to call Mr. Kang and beg for his life. Still he refuses. And when those 15 minutes are up Sun-Woo unleashes an incredibly lethal and jaw-droppingly furious ass-kicking like you have never seen. He goes through about 20 men like they weren't even there and dishes out agonising, blood-soaked punishment in one of the most nail-biting escapes you'll ever see.It's now time for Sun-Woo to plan his revenge. And that he does with lovingly violent detail.A Bittersweet Life comes in 3 large acts that make the 120-minute running time pass in a breeze. The set-up and story are so simple and honest that you can literally start-watching the film at any point and still become immersed in the action. But, I feel that many viewers may be missing the twist at the end.By 'twist' I mean after Sun-Woo's death the film goes back to the beginning, revealing that he only fantasised the whole thing. He says the cruelty of any sweet dream is waking up to find yourself back in the real world. He is still in his restaurant and when no one is looking, insecurely looking over his shoulder to make sure, Sun-Woo shadow boxes for fun or curiosity. Hardly the kind of behavior you would expect from a man who has just annihilated 50 baddies.But, regardless of the final outcome, it's the high-octane journey you take to get there that really matters right? And A Bittersweet Life is one movie you'll want to watch over and over again.", "After Tale of Two Sisters, Ji-woon Kim's new movie has been eagerly anticipated. In his previous film, the marks of originality, intellectual challenge and superb visual style hailed the possibility of a brave new voice in Korean cinema.A Bittersweet Life commences with similarly awesome photography and ambiance. The wind in the leaves of a tree - Is it the leaves or the wind that moves? asks the disciple of the master. Neither, he replies, it is your mind and heart that moves. Cut to La Dolce Vita, the swish bar restaurant which we are to discover is also the gangland stronghold of Sun-Woo. A single tree in the centre of the restaurant's sky lounge. The colours red and black, glossy and visually forceful in the lounge - they not only play heavily in the film but make any small deviations stand out. Lushness or delicacy is easily conveyed later in the film by colour, a respite to the bloodshed that will almost swamp us. A tinkling piano (Chopin is used as part of the score) adds a delicate counterpoint to what we know will surely be an overload of violence and mayhem.Sun-Woo has served his boss, President Kang, faithfully for seven years and is now manager of Dolce Vita as well as Kang's right hand man. Background profits, and gang competition, focuses on innocuous little sidelines like the supply of guns or dancing girls, and which countries these should come from. Kang has a secret lover from the 'normal' world, a cellist who is much younger than he, and whom he suspects of infidelity. Kang entrusts Sun-Woo to sort it out and show no mercy. The warfare that follows goes beyond honour, beyond profit, beyond vengeance, . . . beyond any rational point in fact.Sun-Woo is the ultimate cool bad guy. Indentured to a world of violence and expert in the use of martial arts, knives and guns, he is almost a humanised Bruce Lee who's woken up on a Tarantino set. It sounds almost too good to be true and it is. The story lines are formulaic and derivative, consisting largely of how to engineer more ingenious punch-ups, torture or revenge posturing. Light humour afforded in the contrast between suave topdogs and bumbling henchmen has been done so many times, and many of the entertaining debacles could have been borrowed from Kill Bill. But entertaining it is, on an undemanding level. Sadly it is not the work of the Master that we might have expected from Two Sisters. \"The dream I had can't come true,\" laments the protagonist, and ironically the dreams Ji-woon Kim's fans may justifiably had don't quite come true in A Bittersweet Life, but this otherwise elegant shoot-em-up is still reasonable 'boys night out' night fare.", "When you sit back to watch this film, be prepared for a film that will open your mind,a film that will make you question humanity, and be prepared to be floored by a visual masterpiece which is rare by gangster movie standards.From the first few shots we are feasted with beautiful shots, angles and little references that are simply delightful. The story unfolds showing the brighter side of life, the sweet side if you like. This is portrayed by Sunwoo eating a desert in the opening scene and then more food as the first half continues. The film then plays out to its darker half and we are shown the bitter side of life, which i wont go into and destroy for you.Everything about this film just...Works, even the martial arts scenes are well edited and seem clever, rather than tricking us with quick camera cuts, we get a raw and violent slice of brutal gangster revenge, which again simply delights in a strange bitter way.Simply put, A bittersweet life is simple plot, filmed and played exactly how it is meant to be, exactly how you want it to be. Every scene is fresh with humour or suspense which is so rare by todays standards.This films plays out exactly how you want it to, with the exact camera angles it should, with the perfect music to back it all up. This film is a dark and visual spectacle that must be seen to be believed.9/10", "This was possibly the greatest film I have ever seen. It was superb on so many different levels. The script, the fighting, the special effects all mould the perfect film. Within the first ten minutes i knew this film was going to keep me on the edge of my seat. I have never been so excited by action scenes before and never laughed with so much shock at the extent of brutal fighting. It is a genre of its own as it has none of that Hollywood business where the bad guys always fail and the main character is invincible and although love is a factor it is not overplayed. This film is electrifying to say the very least. It has more fist action than all the ROCKYs put together, more blood than Goodfellas and is as exciting if not more than a Tarantino film.", "... but not only. At the beginning there is a clear homage to a french movie (an almost exactly reconstructed camera move/set-up)! But this movie is more than just the sum of it's parts! And the clue is in the beginning ...A Korean friend of mine told me (Randy N.) that the story reminded him very much of a tale, the \"Tale of \"Jo-Shin\" (Dream of Jo-shin)\" or again in his words \"This tale is one of the most famous Korean tale(And there are many similar tale in Asian culture...).\" So if you listen to the monologue at the beginning and at the end, you will get the movie and what it means. Because this is more than just an action flick. But don't worry, there's plenty of action here to enjoy also. Maybe even too much action for some to stomach! Not for the faint of heart, believe me, or for those who can't stand the sight of blood! It's very philosophical and it has action in it. Highly recommended!", "South Korea has lately been raised as the promised land of cool action movies. And not without a good reason. Oldboy showed us how surprising, daring and gritty Korean movies can be. A Bittersweet life fits the formula otherwise, except its story is age old.An assassin is hired by a gang boss to find out if the gang boss's girlfriend is having an affair with another man. If so, the assassin has to kill both of them. But, as it happens, the assassin falls in love with the girlfriend himself. With violent results. And then he goes out to revenge. In Hollywood, they probably would've made a boring Steven Seagal movie, that follows the same pattern seen a million times already. But in Korea even an old story like this can be made to look cool and refreshing. The result is so good, you can feel it in your stomach. It all works out fine. The actors, the action, the direction. Even the love story is oddly touching. Highly recommended especially to those, who haven't yet seen any korean action movies.**** The best part: (minor SPOILER) The race to load guns at the Russian arms dealer", "usually i don't go for movies when i have college and work both in my hands, thats why when i first started on this movie(recommended by a friend) i was thinking \"why am i wasting my time watching this?\" After seeing this for while i realized that everything is going to get more interesting as the movie proceeded. The action literally took me out of my seat, I've seen a lot of action movies but this one had the simplicity and also the brutality of a fight when it happens in real life. Some movies you just see and realize its good and then you carry on with whatever you're gonna do next. But this movie got me thinking deep of how beautiful and innocent love is........a movie i would recommend to all who r always in search of good movies....", "Very stylish and very bloody, A Bittersweet Life may not be the 'classic' that some have hailed it to be, but it is a very good addition to the Asian gangster genre that is well worth watching. Director Kim Jee-Woon has given us a gripping tale of revenge that treads a well worn path, yet does it with enough panache and style for us to forgive the occasional clich\u00e9.Byung-hun Lee plays Sun-woo, cooler-than-cool right-hand man to crime boss Kang, and manager of a swish hotel. Kang asks Sun-woo to keep an eye on his young girlfriend, Hee-Soo, who he suspects is seeing another man; in the event of his suspicions proving to be true, Sun-woo is to kill the girl and her lover.But when Sun-woo does eventually discover Hee-Soo with another man, he grants the young couple mercy. Angered at Sun-woo disobeying his orders, Kang instructs his men to hunt him down and make him pay for his treachery.They catch him, and submit him to mental and physical torture but, before they are able to kill him, Sun-woo escapes. An extremely miffed Sun-woo then sets about exacting revenge on those responsible for trying to bump him off.With a plot that is neither as fresh or as clever as that other recent great Korean revenge drama, Oldboy, Kim Jee Woon's movie owes a lot of its success to lead actor Byung-hun Lee who puts in a confident performance that is the epitome of cool: dressed in a snappy suit, this hard-as-nails gangster is an unflappable fellow, even faced with what seems like certain death.As one would expect, there is plenty of violence, which slowly escalates until the inevitable final showdown between Sun-woo and Kang. These scenes are handled with aplomb and will go down well with fans of action cinema.With an ending that is open to interpretation by the viewer, A Bittersweet Life leaves one thinking about the film long after the credits have rolled. Despite its occasional flaws and peculiarities (I still don't understand why the majority of the Korean gangsters don't have guns?), I recommend fans of Asian cinema seek this one out, before the inevitable Hollywood remake rears its ugly head.", "It's seems like there is no stopping Korean cinema, as the year isn't yet over and they've already released a handful of spectacular features. Aside from Sympathy for Lady Vengeance, A Bittersweet Life was the second revenge driven film I was eagerly awaiting. I kept my expectations at a reasonable level, even though I was well aware of Kim's reputation, his eye for capturing detail and his strength at creating eerie atmosphere.And the atmosphere here was felt right from the start. Byung-hun Lee plays Sun-woo, a hotel restaurant enforcer and a trusted henchman to a powerful crime boss. From the initial glimpse, Lee carries heavily confined mannerisms and easily achieves seriousness and believability. The action, although a bit reminiscent of the Far East style, is intense yet touches the limits of implausibility, much like the ending. I must say that it wasn't the action that held my interest at first, but Lee's character who was sharply followed by the camera through the nights of driving and contemplating. He vacantly lives from one day to next, feeling strongly disconnected from the world around him, but still manages his duties to perfection and to much praise from his boss Kang.That's until he gets entrusted by Kang to carry out a short task involving his young mistress. The female character had some potential in the beginning as she evoked some elusive feelings in our gloomy lead, but she was abruptly shelved. The story makes the turning point as his mission goes awry, but before I was able to question the cause and effect, next came the brutally unprecedented fight between Sun-woo and the thugs. This helped the story quite a bit, since it showed how something small and avoidable could turn into something big and ugly.This surprisingly fills approximately half of the film. The remaining time offers few black comedic elements, fistful of rapid shooting sequences and even hints at a possibility of a Mexican standoff. Not to nitpick or complain, but purely for the sake of conversing and since the movie is labeled as a \"real life\" actioner, there are moments when you think just why weren't these gangsters carrying guns at so many instances? And no, I didn't ask the same question with Kill Bill.In the beginning of the film, Sung-woo recited; \"Master, are the branches moving or is it the wind?\" - \"That which moves is neither the branches or the wind...It's your heart and mind\". I'm no expert at this or a big fan of decoding messages, but I think that it could simply mean that Sung-woo (or the audience) never meant to know what specifically cradled his life into such reveries, nor was Sun-woo able find any grounds of communication with his former boss who sometimes looked at him as if he was his own son.Regardless, could seven years of being a loyal servant to a respectful boss really have pushed both parties into such desperate measures over this? Perhaps he was too stubborn or jealous of Kang to reveal his cause, but why did he decide to help Hee-soo in the first place? Maybe he wanted her to go back to Kang and make him happy. After all, he was such a calculating person that didn't desire love. Maybe it was just because she found him boring and ethereally played cello? Sun-woo's final quote suggested his envision of a dream or its demise. He failed to achieve what he desired. I failed to fully grasp what he desired as well. Perhaps he wanted a more ambiguous finale that gangsters rarely get afforded in reality, but the one he received was pretty dubious on its own. I ask these questions not in vain or to mercilessly critique this film, but because I genuinely wanted to know more about what drove these characters and wouldn't have minded if the movie was longer. After all it was because of Hee-soo that Sun-woo got to travel on a different path in life. If you'll omit such speculations or enhance the plot by filling in the subtleties of Sun-woo's motives then I'm sure you'll find this film very uncompromising and intense from the first reel up until the final hodgepodge of a bloodbath.Overall this was a fairly decent noirish piece with a prosaic story, glossed by few slick action sequences that will likely get some fans rallied. Although the film shares few similarities with OldBoy, it doesn't compare nor achieves the brute straightforwardness seen in such films as Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Peppermint Candy. It was stylistically directed with pleasant music and cinematography, but it ultimately left me unaffected by the underdevelopment of characters leading up to the final showdown. Maybe it was its intent to come off this way, but at the end of the day I am merely a film fan looking for characters to empathize with, be they cold hearted rapists or washed out ex silver medalists on a bad luck streak.Nevertheless, this film is still recommended and is much better than what Hollywood puts out there most of the time. Give it a try and hopefully you'll find it more overall satisfying than I did.", "Beautiful and brutal. Close to perfect. A hit-man, hired to watch over his boss's mistress, is unable to carry out an execution when he uncovers information concerning the mistress. As a result, he signs his own death warrant. \"Bittersweet Life\" is influenced by Woo's \"The Killer\" and \"Bullet in the Head\", although the pic's nihilism has stronger parallels in Johnny To's masterpiece \"A Hero Never Dies\". The violence is bloody and balletic, exquisitely choreographed and ultra-graphic. There is a melodramatic tone to the drama that imbues each scene with enormous tragedy. It becomes difficult to watch a man suffer so much for simply being a man. Like \"Hero...\", the film has many fantastique elements and can not be judged along traditional lines of dramatic logic. In one sequence, our hero escapes from a muddy grave that no average man could possibly breach. In another, our bullet-ridden hero ignores his physical disintegration in order to complete his mission. Ultimately, this is the story of a lost man who finds his true self via an act of selflessness. And the price one must pay to stand alone.", "I first stumbled upon this film from an Asian website. After its release on DVD, almost everyone on that site was discussing the main character, \"the smile\", and most importantly, his bittersweet life. Starting with the film's visual aspect, it definitely sets the tone of cool, almost like the grayish gloomy tones in Le Samurai(If you loved this movie, you must see Le Samurai) by Herman Melville. His hotel room lacks emotion and appeal, just barren and simple like Sunwoo. The Dolce la Vita bar sways the mood of Sunwoo into this absurd, fragile yet dangerous atmosphere of the Korean gangs. All the blood reds, jet blacks and pure white symbolizes the world of Sunwoo to us, professionally pure yet ruthlessly violent. The acting in this film was superb and extraordinarily done. All the characters only display primary emotions, happiness, anger, fear and dismay. I know this might turn you off as saying there is a lack of extensive creativity, in the world of thugs, creativity can not exist. Mun-Suk was damn fine as an incompetent yet super suck-up to Mr.Kang and he proved it until the end as a backstabbing usual thug. President Kang, well, he won a best supporting actor, and you'll damn get a kick out of him, his raunchy thuggish snarls to his straightforward astonishing violent attacks. Everyone else is simply brilliant and worth watching. In terms of violence, this is the most COOOOOOOOLEST gun scenes you'll ever see. Nothing flashy pansy, this movie god damn rocked. Hurray for Lee Byung-Hun and his astonishing and amazing career, hope to see more of his movies.A BitterSweet Life by Kim Ji-Woon, 10/10", "I'm writing this mostly to put thoughts into order on the idea of a film manipulating the audience. It comes up on film forums now and then and I can agree in principle because I recognize it from personal experience, that some films enable the viewer to experience a feeling while other films demand it of him, but watching KJW's film made it more clear for me. The formula of the revenge film is put in full practice here as a plot, in the first half we get the cruel injustice, in the second half the furious vengeance, yet KJW believes he's making more than a revenge film. The trouble here is that stock characters are put through the motions of living stock feelings and the bodyguard ordered to watch his boss's girlfriend falls in love because the film demands it of him. The film opens with a shot of trees blowing in the wind and a quote of the most banal philosophy (-\"is it the branches moving or the wind?\" -\"it's your heart and mind\"). This is trying to resemble a Wong Kar Wai film with the crucial difference that the sadness and longing feel artificial, not the result of personal conviction but rather that these ideas would look good on the film. That may be because KJW relishes the bloodshed. No other part of the film receives the care and attention of the scenes of violence.Yet by the end of it, KJW isn't satisfied with a crime flick where blood gushes out of bullet holes (of which it's a good one), he wants emotion to pour out of the finale. For all this to work for me, for me to be able to acquiesce to the experience as something worth opening myself to, I need to hear the film play itself. Like a music instrument, a film that plays itself is music to my ears, good or bad at least it's an effort. I want to be able to see the film absorbed by its music like it doesn't even matter I'm there. KJW's film wants to play me, to use me as the music instrument to create emotion. A melancholy piano tunes in the right moment, we get a shot of the protagonist shedding a tear, this fabricated emotion is then cut by the loud bang of a pistol. To get back to what I wrote above, some films let me determine whether I will be sad or angry, A Bittersweet Life anxiously expects it of me, it's like the film is studying my reactions to see will I shed a tear. To the degree that all films are artifice, it could have something to do with different levels of transparency to that artifice.I don't know if KJW's problem is that he doesn't have obsessions as a filmmaker. This is the third of his films I've actively disliked and all three of them are vastly different to each other. He's good with technique but, like Tarantino, he seems he doesn't have anything personal to share. In place of nothing to exorcize, he seems to pick every time a different genre to stave off boredom. As though anxious to prevent that same boredom in his audience, he fills his movies with passing thrills. At the same time he aspires to more than passing thrills, yet when the time comes for his film to express a conviction that the world is a certain way we get banalities.", "After seeing thousands of Asian films, the tendency for the average viewer is to become jaded. How many revenge movies can one see until the premise get's old? How many Asian \"shocks\" does it take before being the jolts become normal? That being said, every once in a while, a film comes along that rejuvenates my faith in Asian cinema. A film that takes the simple and tired old formula and spins it into a masterpiece of epic proportions. A Bittersweet Life is one of those films. A masterwork of Korean Cinema that doesn't fail to impress even the most jaded viewer and at the same time, doesn't leap into a formulaic revenge flick.The story is simple, Kim Sunwoo is an enforcer for a Korean Mob Boss Mr. Kang. One day, Mr. Kang announces that he'll be leaving for a few days and asks Kim if he'll watch over his mistress while he's gone. Mr. Kang suspects that his mistress has taken another lover and asks Kim to watch over her, and if he happens to catch her in the act, to immediately call him or \"take care of them\". Kim eventually does catch the mistress cheating with another young man. Instead of following his boss' wishes, Kim decides to let them go. When the boss comes back and realizes he's been lied to he tries to have Kim killed. He is unsuccessful and soon all hell breaks loose.A Bittersweet Life is a masterpiece of contemporary Korean Cinema, on par with that of Park-Chan Wook's Oldboy and Bong Joon-ho's Memories of Murder. The central reason for this, would obviously be Kim Ji-Woon's expert direction. Just as he revitalized the Korean Horror genre with a Tale of Two Sisters, he does so with the Korean Gangster flick in A Bittersweet Life. Kim Ji Y also does an excellent job bringing Kim Ji's vision to life and many of the shots in the film border on breathtaking. In particular, the shots filmed in the rain, of exiled Sunwoo, surrounded by a cloud black umbrella's held by Mr. Kang's syndicate are incredible.Another of the film's big strengths is the score. The film's music features Spanish-inspired guitar pieces, techno, pseudo classical violin pieces, and jazzy/salsa influenced guitar riffs and all work perfectly with the film ever changing moods. Indeed, the film's music is almost as important to the whole package as Byung-hun Lee superb performance.And speaking of Byung-hun Lee, he really is the glue that holds the production together. Towards the beginning of the film he plays the role of Sunwoo as a very quiet and subdued, almost pathetic (except for when he has to kick some major ass, which he does in style) but an event about halfway through the film hardens him and he is resurrected into a monster of sorts, one hell-bent on revenge for his former boss.Oh, and who could forget the action? A Bittersweet Life is full of hard, brutal action (the kind I love so much). The film's action is spread liberally throughout the film, unlike much of the other Korean Gangster films which usually only have spattering of violence here and there. Jung Doo Hong's action scenes are no nonsense. There's no flashy Kung-Fu sequences, just brutal realistic fights and gun-play (although, some of it is a bit over the top). The last 20 minutes of the film features a balls to the wall finale, as Sunwoo singlehandedly takes on the entire syndicate in a sequence strongly reminiscent of Brian Depalma's Scarface.Bottom Line- A Bittersweet Life is an unabashed masterpiece of Korean Cinema.", "This is a revenge movie, pure and simple. When it comes to this genre, the protagonist usually has some injustice (loosely used here) done unto him, and therefore unleashes hell upon those who incurred his wrath, who of course, failed to finish him off in the first place.Sun-woo (Lee Byung-hun) is a hotel manager. Or so he seems. On the surface, he's calm, cool and collected. But step out of line, he brings upon his fury without remorse, and without sympathy. His cockiness earns him no admirers, but he gives his utmost loyalty towards his boss, President Kang.He leads a lonely existence without friends, and in his latest mission, strikes a forbidden friendship with his prey that led to his ostracizing from the clan he belongs to. Relying on his personal judgement, in contradiction with his boss's, he consciously interpreted his mission ambiguously, and this led to his downfall. In the mob, as a servant, you do not think, but carry out orders like a faithful dog. Such is his life for seven years, until now.As with revenge films, those who go against you must die, and you soon find yourself up against impossible odds, and with incredible luck. At times the movie stretches its realism to the limit, but for the purpose of good violent fun. The violence is gratuitous - shootings up close, bleeding by the buckets, hand-breaking, fist-fighting, at times making the audience cringe at too much crimson.But thumbs up for the action pieces, which were well choreographed, especially the escape fight scene (you must learn, never to give a few minutes to a hit-man), and the climatic shoot out finale. Poetry in motion some might add, at times shot like John Woo's slow-motion style with classical music in the background. Various bad characters are up for our anti-hero's dispatch, and you'll find yourself rooting that he does so with as much pain as possible.On the other end of the spectrum, this film also had incredible amounts of silence and non-action, which punctuated between the action sequences well. Sort of like a breather - the calm before the next storm.The relationship element between Sun-woo and Hee-soo (Shin Min-a) however was never fully explored. It was hinted that the cause of the rift between servant and master was the woman, but because of the lack of explicit narrative and dialogue, this was never brought across in a clear manner, and left open to interpretation. Another element that somewhat fell flat was the forced attempts to inject humour with bumbling characters. Felt a bit out of place and the pacing suffered a tad bit.Nonetheless, as a revenge movie, this film delivered. But there's somewhat a nagging thought in me that it could, and should have reached its full potential given the superb cast, stylish action and of course, bloody violence.", "This movie delivers on gangster action and torture scenes but flops on the love side of the story and the plot twists. This is a linear movie where you almost know the end before it starts and are just watching to see the details of how it goes. It's well shot, well cast but no story to speak of that would keep your attention. What I liked in this movie was some of fight scenes were a bit rough and crude and not as dance-like while others were very slick- it gave a good feel for the different ways a fight can go down.PLOT: A man's world goes all to crap in the gangster business and he can't seem to figure out why even though the answer is so obvious. Asian fight scenes and automatic weaponry with a fetish for knives abounds. Other movies do the same thing better such as \"hard boiled\"- one of the classics. Sure I think that was Chinese and not Korean but.. hey.. bullets is bullets.", "A Korean gangster flick that excels in every aspect. It deals with a right hand man who is supposed to follow the boss's girlfriend and report any suspicious activities. He catches her having an affair and doesn't say anything. Another crime family is persisting that he apologize for beating some of their members. These things all come to a head resulting in one hell of a showdown.The same director who did I Saw The Devil (2010) brings us this masterpiece. It has John Woo type action with an incredible score. It does have an Oldboy feel and near the end you can see the influences of Scarface (1983). Clocking in at two hours this is one fast paced ride full of imagery. You won't find much wrong with this one so enjoy.", "This is how mafia films should be and how I love them. Since its Korean obviously a little raw,sharp Round the edges and leaves you with a sour taste in taste in your mouth. Along with the obligatory oh what did I just watch moment. Haven't seen such a fine mafia film for a while, while Hollywood tries to turn Mafia films in summer block busters Korea is still doing it right. The difference between a modern Hollywood thriller and Korean cinema is that you question yourself is he going to live, is he? And often you are (un) pleasantly surprised.The film follows a crime boss and his enforcer, who happens to be a man of honor in his own sense and not a big fan of well words. The film is a single story line but branches off, rivalry between different mafia houses, the chiefs girlfriend, the enforcer, love, revenge, a whole lot of kicking ass and broken bones. But simply put its a story about doing what's right and love, more importantly this still is a better love story than twilight. Not a lot of films in this genre leave a big smile on your face when they end this with its irony does.The other major difference would be feeling empathy, while Sundance and other festival showcase the hard hitting dramas of Hollywood, pick a Korean action film and it still would make you feel something.The cinematography is phenomenal it doesn't go crazy with color tones and doesn't care much about CGI its all really nicely thought out shots and well done stunts. There are some gorgeous frames that you don't see everyday and the way they show you something happening without explaining the whole thing or body is just beautiful.Bonus points for gangster film with no nudity and well there is gore lots of it, you don't like blood? This one isn't for you.The action is paced really nicely there are buildups and then serene moments. If raid is action films headliners done right this is raid without the red bull. Music is a bit of a let down but makes up for it with a great sound mix.This one definitely goes in my must watch list. Also won't watch it again list just because of the sheer intensity of the film."], "107": [], "108": [], "109": [], "110": [], "111": ["Do not let the cheesy title of this series fool you. This is extraordinary from many points of view. Historically, it is based on an actual setting, something very few people in this country would know about Korea, Japan and the USA. Within that framework, the clash of cultures, where values are different and honor prevails. The aesthetics of the production are something to marvel at. And then, the characters, who behave in accordance to strict rules surely strange to us behaving in ways that are, ultimately, quite fascinating. The love relation develops strangely, slowly and far from any courtship you could ever imagine. That gets performed by the two main characters in rather fascinating fashion as well. I do not recall seeing a picture where a still face and a minimal movement could unload so much expression. Actress Tae-ri Kim packs more beauty and feeling in still silence than any actress I can recall; she deserves stardom just for such incredible skill.\nI have seen five episodes, and I am mesmerized.", "This is an epic drama loosely based on the history of Korea from the perspectives of different but engaging characters. It is set in the time where Joseon (Korea) is fought over between different countries with America and Japan. The main character is played by Byung-Hun Lee, who is a phenomenal Korean actor and opposite of his role is Tae-ri Kim who is a newer actress. Byung-Hun Lee has many years of experience and is a well known Korean actor and he has appeared in numerous American films such as G.I. Joe and R.E.D. Both the actors bring fierce intensity to their roles with their well acted scenes and show such emotion through their lines, looks and even their stares. The supporting cast is also superb as they tell their own stories in this conflicted time. All in all the drama has great production value and truly keeps you mesmerized through it's weekly episodes. If you are a fan of Korean dramas or even if you aren't familiar with them, then this is a great series that you can watch.", "I am a huge fan of Korean shows, and this one is no exception. It is a beautiful story, with just as beautiful cinematography and rich characters. As others have written, the first episode kind of goes all over the place, but it is worth sticking around, because you basically figure out who is who in the second episode.", "Im ABSOLUTELY loving it. The writers did an amazing job with the casting( loved everyone role)and the scripts. It was, emotional, funny, educational, exciting, passionate, just a little of it all. The cinematography was absolutely breathtaking, the slow action parts bonus. First time I ever watched a Korean series with subtitle and it won't be my last. I can't say enough, but to give a chance, and watch it, and see for yourself. Thank you for a great series and thanks to the writers and actors. Wish you many more successes.", "The show is set in early 20th century Korea, few years away from being occupied by the Japanese Empire. The ruling Joseon dynasty has finally opened up their ports to Western powers and modernization is happening at an unprecedented pace for historically xenophobic Koreans. The setting is a playground for showmakers to flaunt the beauties of multiple cultures: Korean, Japanese, and Western. And they flaunt them masterfully, coupled with the beautiful Korean geography. For every episode I was overtaken by the aesthetics of the show.The show is also a subject of interest for history buffs. As Westerners watching the show, Korean history is probably the last thing we would be interested by. It is interesting to see how the show portrays adapting Korean people and how foreign involvements in Korea during the period played out. Also, the main character features a Korean-American Marine Corps captain. Sounds far-fetched? Surprisingly not, I have found. And, of course, the romance. I should not say too much, but I will say that the show will make you cheer for the male and female leads. In sum, this show offers no other show has to the greater international audience. I found Netflix to be quite dull when it comes to recent originals. But Netflix really outdid themselves this time around.", "Haven't watched such a good series in years!

His portrait as a U.S. Marine is absolutely incredible. I'm highly impressed on how much his English has improved over the years. This show is a must watch.

The cinematography work is stunning, the battle scenes are well choreographed and realistic, and there is some great acting in this show. The story line is shaping up to be an interesting one. There is a lot going on in this first episode, and you may find yourself frustrated at first, trying to figure out the timeline and characters, as there are flash forwards and more than one story line, but it looks at least for now, that they will start merging fairly quickly.

It's worth binge watching over and over again.", "To the writer, director, cast anf everybody who made this series possible, thank you for this beautiful work of art. It has given me hours of joy watching a memorable story unfold and each scene showed a lot of hard work and dedication and is a product of love from everyone behind this series.

My wish would be for it to be in English. But my fear is that it would ruin the consistent poetry of the Korean language. It's eloquent even as it uses contemporary expressions in the subtitles. It would be interesting to hear the story in its historical context. For example, the series Deadwood uses such language that matches perfectly with the expressiveness of the language used during the pioneering era in the American westward expansion. The whole soul of a language is so very important and difficult, and Shakespeare proves that easily. There are long pauses in the dialogue which tries to emphasize the subtextual meanings in both the language as well as the scene itself. And the cinematography is elegant and filled with gracious wisdom, making the long pauses worth the wait/weight of the meanings between words. It is both an intellectual and spiritual experience. Some may say it is soap opera, but this is a masterpiece of historical costume drama with the most eloquent balance between all aspects of making a film work. The actors are so perfectly matched as they experience one another in character. My favorite balancing act in the project is the consistent humour that I've begun to recognize in great epic Asian film projects. Jackie Chan comes to mind when a dramatic moment astonishingly becomes the Keystone Cops and the wonder of Charlie Chaplin. The character actors are genius as their dialogues expand the story using the most powerful and long-lasting aspect of film theory/storytelling. These moments are climactic and as such get us ready for the next constellation of plot structuring. I guess I'm trying to say that I feel the intensity of effort and belief going into the project, and that alone makes it worth watching.", "Elements of Japanese and Korean culture colours and beautiful photography sets!

Byung-Hun Lee does an outstanding job with his acting, in three languages to boot!", "I just finished watching the last episode and am already wishing it hadn't ended. The show was beautifully done, whether the acting, costumes, music or the best, cinematography. Episode 1 was a little confusing but you quickly settled into the story and characters in episode 2 and from then on, you are enthralled and transported to the turn of the century, Korea. I surely wish the title of the show was something a bit different especially as it had no real meaning. It may keep others from watching. It would be their loss. Perhaps the story is somewhat biased in making the Japanese characters to be so evil but certainly from Korea's perspective, it is understandable. And that antagonism is critical to the heart of the story. Lee Byung Hun did an absolutely stellar job with his acting, in all three languages. But he is not alone with the acting. All of the main characters showed great depth, particularly when they were not speaking. Their looks spoke volumes. Congratulations to all those on the show and behind the show. It truly was well done. And a big thank you to Netflix for bringing it to us.", "Stand out performance by the 5 leads,truly stellar. The many supporting cast was spot on.

Pact with historical themes, very interesting characters, class warfare, revenge and absolution. What I enjoyed most was the pacing of the story, it rarely gets \"stuck\".

It's an extraordinary, collective love story of interconnected souls---of the so-called \"good\" and \"bad\"---that stem from the extremely rare, Unconditional, True Love (of self and others).Though the story also includes a love story between two individuals, it's not the typical one that's been diluted throughout the ages, and often based on the very common, conditional love and/or lust.When viewed with an OPEN mind and heart---aka integrated Mind/Heart of Soul/Spirit within---you will truly appreciate the showing of the FULL rainbow spectrum of human aspects that exists within all of us (to varying degrees), ranging from the contrast/duality/polarity of the so-called good and bad, right and wrong, light and dark, etc. As you pay close attention, you will realize that experiencing any form of duality helps us to deeply appreciate its opposite. For instance, we can never experience what we call Unconditional Forgiveness UNTIL we've experienced the opposite energies such as heartbreak, betrayal, anger, rage, hatred, and/or sadness; hence, even the so-called \"negative\" aspects have a Divine purpose to highly benefit interconnected Life, despite outer appearances.As collective humanity, our ego selves---conditioned by society since childhood---are often quick to judge everything, everyone and their mamas and grandmamas, and especially anything unknown or somewhat foreign. And this show can remind us to clearly see, and intensely feel, the bigger picture with an expanded perspective.Earthly labels such as race, ethnicity, gender, social status (e.g., slave vs royalty), positions, ranks, financial background, education level, family history, etc. gracefully move with the ebb and flow of Life as they play the game of separation consciousness vs unity consciousness, collide and then break way, and even gently and beautifully merge as One.I'm very grateful that the creators incorporated magnificent fireworks of all invaluable, human emotions (our inner compass revealing our authentic state) and feelings (language of the Soul), which are Divine, precious gifts given to humanity while experiencing the physical world on planet Earth.In this very fast-paced, instant gratification society that we live in, it's a breath of fresh air to experience highly creative cinematography and storytelling at its finest. This impressive series include some of the following soul-igniting themes that radiate humanity (and its significant opposites that make them stand out in the spotlight): fascinating, lovable and memorable characters, inner-strength, courage, determination, resilience, honor, loyalty, deep understanding, pure compassion, empathy, unconditional forgiveness, true friendship, outstanding teamwork, fiery passion, freedom to make a choice, wild adventures, intelligence (mental and emotional), patience, gratitude, deep appreciation, charisma, refreshingly honest communication, heartfelt verbal and nonverbal expressions (like gentle yet intense eye contact), joy in various forms (like free-spirited playfulness), inner-peace, wisdom, the dance between the material and spiritual worlds, and last but not least...profound, Unconditional Love.By the way, the creators also did an excellent job of integrating humor into various scenes in Divine perfect timing and order. So don't be surprised if you find yourself smiling, chuckling, laughing, and even rolling and/or holding your stomach due to hilarious moments. ^_^So far, this is hands down THE BEST Korean drama I've ever watched, and I'm a Japorean-American who lived in Korea most of my childhood, and was also stationed there for three years while in the Army. Thank you so much to everyone who contributed to this amazing creation. You definitely went above and beyond, and I have no doubt that you will continue to Be a wonderful gift to this world, merging worlds, Galaxy, Universe, and beyond.", "Cinematography - Breathtakingly beautiful. They've captured the beauty of Joseon in an accurate but still visually stunning manner. Acting - Every single actor/actress is excellent in ever language they speak, every weapon they wield. Nobody is artificial. Everyone will make their case. South Korea's best talents in their best game. Dialogue - It's meaningful yet heavy prepare for that.

The final message for sure takes center stage here instead of the plot.The captain and the female officer gave fantastic performances. The cases are interesting and essential to the main character finding his past and formulating his thoughts and choices for the future. And the cliffhanger really shines he main character fights to make sure the tough choice actually makes sense.The chemistry between the 2 male lead is good. The comedy aspect is not overdone. The strange gathering place where they drink and talk gives a weird vibe.My only gripe is the constant same camera trick of pulling zoom whenever the main character have a headache.

It's funny, romantic af and the chemistry between the leads is off the charts. The male lead is fantastic, the female lead is super cute and the supporting cast is awesome too. Basically, Secretary Kim has been working for nine years as the assistant of the Vice Chairman of a company and now she's resigning. Why? She's paid off the debts of her father and sisters, and is ready to have a life of her own. For nine years, she's been at the Vice Chairman's beck and call, at night, in the weekend and even during holidays. On top of that, her boss is self-absorbed to the point of narcissism. So, she's done.The Vice Chairman is shocked when she announces her decision to quit - because he thinks he is the best boss and most perfect guy ever - and immediately starts to come up with schemes to get her to stay. Somehow he gets it into his pretty little head that Secretary Kim is in love with him, so he starts to woo her. With hilarious results, because she hates his guts.Seriously, just watch this series! It's so good and so satisfying. You'll laugh and cry and sigh (mostly laugh and sigh, though, at how adorable the main couple is). The male lead is gorgeous and hilarious, the female lead has got a great evil smirk, the sound effects are the best and the side stories of the other characters are absolutely worth your time too. I'm probably just going to watch the whole series again real soon, because watching anything else after this can only lead to disappointment.", "What's Wrong with Secretary Kim is just an okay drama. It has a cute approach to the story, that also involves some mystery about a kidnapping and a chilhood drama, but they kind of overeploit that theme and it got tiring towards the end. The romance, for me, it was so so. There was chemistry and everything, but the script didn't help to create the right mood. In the end, the romance scenes seemed forced to be funny when they weren't. The performances, in addition, were nice and enjoyable at least. The side stories interesting as well.

At first you see mostly the funny side of things, with the hero being so amazingly arrogant you just have to laugh.The chemistry between the two leads is undeniable from the start, but the most amusing aspect for me was the hero getting a rude awakening when he has to come to terms with his secretary's decision to resign her position ... after nine long years of being a well paid servant.He's baffled, confused, stunned, because who wouldn't want to be at his beck and call all day, every day?That's what we see at first, but as the series progresses we go a lot deeper into the shared history of both lead characters (that goes right back to childhood), and inevitably take a more sympathetic view toward that arrogant hero. The story is moving.I will definitely be watching this series again, because I adored it the first time. Great acting, and numerous captivating side stories to watch unfold as well.", "An entertaining romantic comedy with great chemistry between the leads. Certainly does not tax your brain and while they did try to throw in a little mystery with the kidnapping story when they were children, it too was predictable as was the progress of the romance.

Combine the 2 + when she also shows her teeth...sigh...Words like GODDESS & ANGEL have been used for her, but they really only scratch the surface of this divine being. And from what I've read about her kindness to fans, the warmth and joy in that smile is totally genuine. Plainly, the Korean Govt needs to designate her a national treasure & a public holiday on her birthday is also justified. And her voice is lovely too.\nOh yes, um, back to the show ! The writing is very good ( the eps with the toy machine and the beach are especially memorable ) , lots of humour and tears of course too, & even the last ep had some small surprises in store. The support cast are great, though Hwang Bo Ra as Chief Bong is irritating early on ( but does improve ) while the lovely Pyo Je Jin as the replacement secretary lights up the screen whenever she's on.\nAs to the S word, how can KTV be so prudish when KPop is so raunchy ? There's a scene where a a woman enters a room & a man appears in a modest bathrobe having just showered, so she averts her eyes as if there's a tentpole going on ! I laughed out loud. And since these 2 are both presumed virgins & have never dated anyone, the lack of realism in that regard is absurd & will stop Hallyu from reaching viewers around the world who know how boys interract with girls. Another time, an event unfolds which is VERY pivotal for the couple involved, but it's treated as an amusing diversion ! ..sigh...\nMy advice : tackle these issues please, & it can be easily done with humour and without anything remotely graphic being shown. They're not called the Facts of Life for nothing, yet I recall a simple comment the VC makes to PMY which was actually overtly erotic & quite compelling as a result ! So there's hope.\nAlright; you need to watch this show, & I'll conclude, naturally, with the celestial PMY : if I was ever to meet her in person I would obviously die on the spot, but at least I'd die happy....sigh...."], "116": ["One of the best kdramas I have ever seen.

Thought I have to balance the negative review before mine cos I really enjoyed this show ( which, by the way, is called \"The Undateables\" on VIKI ).\nFirst though, let's review the components of the K drama formula which you'll soon encounter once you become a regular : TWO GUYS pursuing ONE GIRL, though guy2 is never totally viable. LEAD MALE is rich & LEAD GIRL is not, with girl introducing guy to the simple pleasures he missed out on. FIRST MEETING OF MAIN COUPLE is angry/awkward. LOTS OF \"ACCIDENTAL\" occasions early on for main duo to touch/hug ( Aaargh ! VERY ANNOYING, by the way ! ). AT LEAST ONE PARENT of main duo is dead. AT LEAST 1 MAJOR CRISIS for main duo before inevitable happy ending.

Formula aside, it's the other stuff that makes a good K Drama, like the story/script, emotional connection & quality of the cast. Like a few other under-rated K dramas, this one delivers in all areas.\nCentral couple are vital, obviously, & Hwang Jung Eum as the girl & Nam Goong Min as the guy have great chemistry in my opinion.

I just can't stand that she always has to be right, always is the innocent one, and always cries when things don't go her way. It's annoying. The drama was way better when it focused more on the other characters, plus, her \"I'm the saviour\" attitude gets really boring after a while.\nI just kept hoping they would kill her off and often wonder what it would be like without her or with a different actress.", "This show was quite melodramatic at times, though I certainly cared enough about the main characters to want to keep watching. There was a bit of overkill when it came to the use of emotive background music.I usually love legal dramas, but Miss Hammurabi compared to, say, Suspicious Partner, for me falls a little short of the mark. It didn't really have one overarching mystery that got solved in the end, so felt a bit haphazard.I wanted more closure on one of the main cases that we saw the judges handle - it would have been satisfying to see more justice served there. All in all the loose ends were tied up satisfactorily though.In summation: this was an \"all right\" drama that didn't make it to my faves list."], "122": ["About time introduces the viewer with a new concept, the ability to see your time of death.

And it did. Unfortunately, the musical parts were tiring, the story started getting boring and the twists were just too predictable to entertain. Those things killed the romance, that was so strong and emotional at first.

The story and its presentation are excellent and the whole atmosphere superb, as well as the performances. This drama has its way to make you cry, as it is packed with emotions and action scenes. However, towards the ending, it did got a bit tiring, but overall it was terribly good, so 8 out of 10.", "This was an outstanding drama, from the cinematography to the music to the acting and writing. The story is an unusual one in that a serial murderer is one of the central characters. The actor who plays that murderer deserves the Korean equivalent of the Emmy for playing that character. He does such an outstanding job that it is hard to believe it is just acting. The main male leads, both the teenage version and the adult versions, wonderfully portray the tortured son swallowing the heartache he feels for being a murderer's son and wondering if he too may be like him. It's hard not to shed tears for him and what he had to endure.", "I went in expecting a tragic ending in this show. I really did. The way it started off and the flashbacks and then about his father I really expected a sad ending. But thankfully it had a happy ending and that made it worth watching. Loved the two main characters, especially the actors who portrayed them as teens. They all did very well. The actor who played his father did fantastic, like omg, he seriously creeped me out throughout the entire series! The flashbacks were a little much but bear with it, trust me it's worth it.

Enjoyed it very much. The story came together like a jigsaw puzzle. It didn't go overboard on unnecessary action and really did cast the perfect actors.", "The exposition of the drama got me hooked. It has the brain (legal battles) and the brawn (physical fights) element, which is a promising combination if you are into action dramas. The promising plot and conflicts are able to keep the audience engaged through episodes, as they are intriguing enough. However, don't expect the fights to be that epic. There are twists, sure, but some are kind of predictable and forced. The twists are not the kind that could make you clap of awe. Then, as expected from Korean dramas, there is the romantic element. I was worried at first that this would ruin the cool prompt, but luckily, it doesn't, as it only serves as an additional sentimental watching experience. However, one thing does bother me: a clich\u00e9 couple conflict. The female lead character is at odd with the male lead, just because he keeps her in the dark for her own sake, while she instantly jumps into conclusion without considering other reasons behind his action. I'm sorry, but this is just too dumb for a so-called lawyer, who is supposedly used to facts and logic. I also notice some details that don't add up, such as the female lead's inability to recognize her own mother when the mother is literally portrayed by the same actress with the only difference is the hair. Sure, the female lead was only a child when the mother left her, but there's a family picture in her father's photo studio, for God's sake! It's just too illogical, let alone since the female lead has always been longing for her mother, which normally would make her keep record of her mother's face. On top of the minor annoyance, the ending is not as epic as expected. It's all resolved just like that, making me question, \"That's it? Just like that?!\"\nThis drama is cool, honestly, but it doesn't last long, let alone until the very end. I think this could be mind-blowing drama if the conflicts are prepared better. I would still recommend this, not to mention if you love watching Joon Ki's fighting scene."], "127": ["I've picked up this drama because I'm a huge Suho fan and I had to watch it. However, my review will be bias free and I'll try to keep it objective. So, first of all, I have not watched the japanese original one, so I can't say if this is better or not. But I did enjoyed some parts of this drama. Some scenes were cute and funny. But, I did not like the story line, as it was kind of messy. Aslo, the romance was weak. I mean, the lead had more kissing scenes with the second lead lady than with the leading lady. I guess, the drama focused more on the company, on the friendship, the past mystery, which wasn't that big, the development of the main character, and left everything else out until the very last episode. There were some sparks here and there, but the love story was very spread out. Aslo, I didn't like that sometimes the acting was a big too forced, like overacting. But that was the case for a few scenes, so I can overlook it overall. \nSumming up, Rich man was an okay drama. It isn't a total wast of your time, just don't expect too much out of it."], "128": ["I don't ever recall seeing such short Korean drama before and I'm happy I took a chance on this drama after seeing short clips of the MCs' interactions. The story plot is simple and can be close to heart for those who have the opposite sex as best/close friends - the one person you always know never to cross the line or not dare to do so in the event you lost the friendship. It's a matter of whether you treasure romance or friendship more and if you are up to taking the dive and find out the outcome of a relationship. It was as if while watching the drama you will also start to hesitate just like them and wonder whether to take the plunge. The pacing of the drama was smoothly done as we go along with the MCs in their discoveries. I really enjoy the performances of both MCs and their on-screen chemistry is just right for the kind of relationship they are having in the drama. The music was just nice and the attraction of perusing French language also quite a sell to this drama. In a way the male character is in the expression of art of love through unique visual representation while the female character is in the expression of art of love through beauty of language. In my opinion the writer weaving these aspects quite perfectly as the background setting.", "A short drama about old friends who fell in love. As it is only 2 episode long there was no built up or any interesting development. However, it was fun to watch and entertaining. The love story was nice and cute, though I didn't like the ending.

I'm only rating this one with 3,5 stars out of 10 because of the performances that were nice and decent and because at some point, the revenge story was entertaining.

And yet, the characters and the story got me hooked within 15 minutes and I binge-watched to the end. Character development is beautiful and slow, timing is impeccable, drama is balanced with light comedy in an effortless way, every single actor is well cast and executes perfectly. And most of all, it is incredibly refreshing to see sensible \"normal\" people compared to all these overly egoistic and egocentric characters in American blockbusters that are only motivated by money, sex, violence, power... I probably should add that I am a hopeless romantic who watches Casablanca every few years and still enjoys it every time. If you fall into this category, no matter what else you like or dislike I highly recommend this series. Also if you are interested in Asian cultures or have never been to Korea you will probably learn a lot. The reason why I started using Netflix was Sense8.

First, the big break up was so flat. We got absolutely no glimpse of the aftermath other than a few tears and a panoramic view in which time lapsed about 3 years. It was confusing.Second; they went their seperate ways which I understand why she didn't want to go and he should have never signed up to leave like he did but jumping forward didn't give us the sense of separation when they met again at her brothers wedding. It was all ackward. We find out he never got over her but she was dating even though she still had feelings for him. We find out how he held up during a conversation with his friend and she tells us how she suffered in a few lines she yelled at him. It just didn't have impact and felt like a quarrel instead of an intense break up. It was flat. Then she quits her job. All that build up to the sexual harassment case and on the last day of work we find out in on line that she won in court. Very anti climatic. So she moves across the country to start over because apparently being in the same vicinity of her ex was to much to bear. He's talking about moving to the States permanently because it's to much to bear. I would have been satisfied if it ended that way. Disappointed but satisfied. No they show her living away with her friend and she pretends to be okay. Aa he's packing he hears her recorded message from 3 years ago and decides to look for her. Am I supposed to believe he hasn't either listened to or deleted it by now? So he goes to find her but she moved. One phone call to her brother and he's on the way. It lacks the suspense it was going for. So he shows up with a lame excuse and eventually apologizes. She's playing confused but ultimately they end up kissing in the rain. We end with them frockling on some rocks back together. It just feels unfinished to me. They rushed all the plot points at the end which killed any dramatic effect they were going for. It was a great story up until then. I was really enjoying it but the last two episodes killed it for me. I could think of 20 different ways it could have been done better that would have been satisiying.", "This is a very modern story compared to many - the family conflicts, work situations and conflicts between society and the relationships are all up to date. The cast do a very good job of making their feelings believable as the characters even during the moments of emotional whiplash from events. and the central characters are very easy to relate to. My sole quibble killing a \"10\" is that many shows use a few songs repeatedly as a theme for given types of moment, but this one really does it to overkill level - I wasn't a great fan of \"stand by your man\" to start with and after hearing it multiple times episode after episode, by the time I got to episode 12 I was repeatedly distracted from the show itself by crying \"stoooooooop\" when that song started up yet again... and again... and again....", "Love the actors and the story.

I loved how realistic and believable Jina and Jinhui's relationship was...I also liked the office plot around the problems Jina faced in and how she dealt with them. Like another review said, the theme song was kind of an overkill and I wished they used other songs throughout the show. I also didn't like the finale as much, as I thought it was a bit slow.

So good I had to restart it right away after finishing it. First time I've ever done that and even now when I'm almost finished with it again I feel like I could easily rewatch it a third time.Son Ye-jin's acting really caught my eye so I am definitely going to explore her filmography more. The way she portrays her character is among the best I've seen. It is one of my favorite characters for sure. Keeping my fingers crossed for a second season.", "After watching this series a second time, I am upgrading the rating to 9 stars.Situated in 2015 Seoul, a 35 year old submissive woman meets younger guy, is wooed and falls in love. The relationship between Jin-A and Jun-Hui, 10 years her junior, is both touching and annoying. The miscommunication, indirectness, missed opportunities, etc., make for some interesting plot arcs. It is enjoyable to watch Jin-A progress from a woman who cannot believe she possesses a guy who is totally consumed by her into someone who, in one sense, doesn't need him anymore but, in another sense, knows he is the only man who will ever truly love her and thus won't settle for anything less.At the lowest level, this series is a Romeo and Juliet type of love story, but it has a number of other more interesting plot issues that make it one of the better k- dramas that is definitely worth the viewer's time. The most important one is the heroine's development into a self confident woman who maintains her compassionate dignity. Next is the sexual harassment plot arc that must be fully played out and ultimately affects the romance. The ultra-traditional mother, who demands Jin-a marries a wealthy husband to the point of, absurdity, takes on a comedic role at times. American viewers who know nothing about Korean culture, like me, may be struck by the constraints placed on Korean women: family duty, the favoring of the son, male chauvinism and laws that seem to treat women as 2nd class citizens. This realistic glimpse into Korean life may be the series best aspect and sets it apart from many other Korean shows.Son Ye-jin, whose wholesome beauty and effortless acting in the role of Jin-A, has a good screen presence and stands out by virtue of the seemingly mild mannered self-deprecating character she develops into mature self-confident woman who decides to live life on her own terms. Supported by a very capable cast, Son is able to juxtapose her character against a panoply of relatives, friends and colleagues who, due to their bondage to Korean traditions, have some significant issues that test Jin-a's determination and humanity.All told, this would make a very good first Korean drama series for you to watch", "Just completed watching the whole series in a few days. Normally I dont watch these type of dramas, but for some reason, it hooked me the moment I clicked on it in Netflix. This drama is about an odd match. A young man chases a older woman. This relationship isn't too much out of the norm in some cultures. But, to make it worst, it turns out he is the little brother of her long time best friend. Now, this fact also isn't too bad as it is common in high school relationships. But, in this culture, it isn't acceptable, especially with their age gap. This untraditional couple end up having to go through of series of obstacles. Overall, this series made me \"aww\" at the adorable moments and sobbed at their worst fights. This series is a great drama to watch for a romantic, especially if you need a quick binge watch.", "The leads and especially Son Ye Jin were terrific in this slow but addictivevly feel good, realistic romance. The chemistry and joy between the leads was the main reason i enjoyed this so much. Yes, the final episodes seemed rushed but I can understand why they didn't dwell too much. I was ok with the ending", "At first, i thought it was kind of boring but when i started to watch it especially because I love Son Ye-Jin and the leading man, Jung Haein is very handsome and a godo actor as well it felt to me as cute as they are in the storyline. Hope to watch another tv series where they are the leading lady and man. I love Son Ye-Jin and Jung Harin's chemistry", "I simply love it.... the slow pace, the intensity of the feelings growing, the shyness to admit they love each other.... Best series I've seen this year !", "Not gonna lie, overall the drama is pretty boring. Based on typical family drama on how parents want to interfere their children dating. Too realistic to feel annoying how the parents act in the drama. Another thing that bugs me is the song. Gosh makes the drama more boring. They played the song unNecessarily everywhere. The only reason that kept me going is THE ACTORS! Bravo to the sweet couple. They are just too adorable together!", "I was 19 years old when I first heard The Beatles. I was rounding the bend on a rural highway, on my way home from Iowa State University to visit my girlfriend in Green Mountain, Iowa. The song was \"I Want to Hold Your Hand.\" I was (and am) no expert on music, but I immediately liked what I heard: the vocal harmonies, the guitars, and the drums. The lyrics, about holding hands, didn't grab me.However, the magic of two people holding hands for the first time did grab me when, as a 73-year-old man, I watched the Netflix K-Drama, \"Something in the Rain.\" The hand-holding scene in the series grew out of the chemistry between a man and a woman, an excellent script, and superb direction.The central character of \"Something in the Rain\" is Yoon Jin-ah (portrayed by Son Ye-jin), a single, 30-something university graduate who lives at home and works at Coffee Bay, a chain of coffee shops-think Starbucks, but smaller. Jin-ah is at the center of two storylines: as a woman falling in love with a younger man and as a target of workplace sexual harassment.Sparks fly when Jin-ah's childhood friend unexpectedly steps back into her life. Seo Joon-hee (Jung Hae-in), a 20-something graduate of art school and a video game designer, has just returned from a three-year assignment in the United States. On his first day back in South Korea, he runs into Jin-ah on the plaza in front of the office building where they both work. Though they clearly are attracted to each other, more than just a years-wide age difference makes a romance problematic. Not long after Joon-hee and his sister, See Kyung-Seon (Jang So-yeon), lost their mother to cancer when they were children, their father abandoned them, effectively turning them into orphans. Jin-ah's parents took the children under their wing, so Jin-ah and her and Joon-hee and his sister grew up together and became best friends-or as some would say, like family.Although both Jin-ah and Joon-hee are no strangers to romance, neither of them has experienced true love and endured the highs and lows that go with it. As their romance begins, their longstanding friendship provides both comfort and an excuse to attribute what's happening between them to be nothing more than feelings of nostalgia. Soon, though, they find it hard to ignore their mutual attraction to each other. Underneath it all, they really are good friends, care about each other, and look out for each other.They soon realize, however, that their families, friends, and co-workers can't accept the age difference between them. In addition, Jin-ah begins to fear that her mother Kim Mi-yeon (Gil Hae-yeon) will see their relationship as borderline incestuous and oppose it vehemently. Joon-hee, naively, is less concerned about these issues. After all, he and Jin-ah are adults and are not doing anything illegal.Nevertheless, the couple hide their budding romance. This secrecy creates all sorts of uncomfortable situations. Jin-ah and Joon-hee sit through uncomfortable scenes in which their friends and family members recount their previous romances in extensive detail. They sit through discussions of what their families think would be suitable marriage partners for each of them. A rival for Joon-hee's attention begins to make a move on him. Before long, Jin-ah and Joon-hee find themselves at the center of a web of deception, even with respect to one another, out of their concern for each other.Despite their attempts to keep their relationship secret, friends and family members slowly discover the truth about it. Most of their friends and coworkers are delighted, though one is disappointed and jealous, but Jin-ah's mother is enraged. She insults Joon-hee and his sister; swats her husband and son for keeping her in the dark about the relationship-she is the last one in the family to learn about it-and warns Jin-ah in no uncertain terms that she will prevail in this dispute.At the same time that Jin-ah's relationship with Joon-hee develops, she begins to speak and act out against oppressive sexual harassment at work. She works in an open office at Coffee Bay's headquarters, where she and her co-workers oversee the operation of a chain of stores, train store managers, and do in-store inspections. Their supervisors and the owner are men, with one exception: a woman placed high in the organization who sides with the women in her charge.Joon-hee supports and encourages Jin-ah as she stands up for herself and the other women in the office. He also supports and defends her when her most recent suitor, a distasteful, spoiled man, tries to force his way back into her life. His support help Jin-ah deal with this obsessive man.I discovered \"Something in the Rain\" after watching \"Live,\" a single-season K-Drama that follows police recruits through the end of their training into their first jobs at a precinct station. \"Live\" was my introduction to South Korea and K-Drama. I fell in love with the sound of the Korean language, the characters, the story line, and the soundtrack. After \"Live,\" I searched for other K-Dramas and discovered \"Something in the Rain.\" I have watched all 16 episodes at least five times and have learned something each time. Why did I do that?First, \"Something in the Rain\" is one of the best series I have watched on Netflix. And for good reason. The two lead actors, a supporting actor (Jang So-yeon), the director (Ahn Pan-seok), and the series itself won prestigious awards in South Korea and elsewhere in East Asia. The director's slowly developing, extended scenes are lovely. In one such scene, Jin-ah and Joon-hee hold hands for the first time. In another, Jin-ah fills and wraps gift boxes, carefully packing each box, folding the wrapping paper, cutting the tape, and taping the paper.Second, because I began watching the show as a novice with regard to South Korean culture, what I learned in my first viewing informed my second viewing, etc. Also, because I do not understand the Korean language, I had to shift my focus back and forth between the subtitles and action and thus missed some of the latter. I realize there remains much for me to learn about Korean culture, but \"Something in the Rain\" was a good introduction.Third, the sound track in the series differs from the soundtracks of most other series I've watched. At first, I found it intrusive, but it grew on me, especially after 2NE1's \"I Am the Best\" near the end of Episode 1 blew me away. Other songs repeatedly announce the tone of upcoming scenes. They include Carla Bruni's cover of \"Stand by Your Man,\" Bruce Willis's cover of \"Save the Last Dance for Me,\" and \"Flea Waltz\" (Lee Namyeon).The relationship between Jin-ah and Joon-hee becomes very difficult after Jin-ah's mother finds out about it, and for a while they separate and Joon-hee returns to the United States to work. However, although both of them seem to have moved on in their lives, they continue to harbor strong feelings for one another. They may be separated, but these soul mates and lovers are very much on each other's mind.The series ends ambiguously: Will Jin-ah and Joon-hee get together and stay together, or will they separate again? In the last few episodes of the series, it seemed that the writers were struggling to find a way to wrap it. I thought the writers were leaving the door open for a second season, but, alas, that doesn't seem to be the case.", "Indeed one of the best Korean dramas i ever watched.

Very nice storyline!I was a bit disappointed on how the story turns in the last two episodes though (the last part of the 15the episode and the last episod). It was very natural up to that point and then it follows a kind of artificial path which maybe they made to give it an artistic culmination. I liked the very ending but not that much how it went there. Hence only 9 stars and not 10.Other than that i think it was great.", "I loved this show it's very sweet and has alot of tender moments. It's got some interesting point of views and can be kinda sad at times. Liked alot of the characters, the acting was spot on.

So hooked that I had to watch it a second time. A month after I finished watching it, I couldn't shake the memories and had to watch it all over again. The love the characters shared for one another was so pure and a joy to watch. This is my first and only Korean entertainment so not sure how close this is to reality. Lol. I am thinking Korean people drink a LOT!!! Was really nice to see the family dynamics since it is so close to Indian culture when in comes to moving up in society. Agree that the series overall is really painfully slow and some twists and turns are just so unnecessary but I was ok since it meant I could watch the two protagonists for a longer time.\nAnd boy was I envious of the numerous numerous numerous hand bags and coats Yoo-Jin Ah possesses; in spite of the tiny closet she seems to own.

There was a big twist towards the end, but not that it isn't easy to predict it. Overall, the story was just okay. When it comes to performances, the switching characters was interesting, though it got a bit tiring after a while, and Geun Suk was good in changing personalities as well. However, at some point, the two weren't that different. Again, the game between who's who, even though it was entertaining at the begining, it got a bit dull. The rest of the performances were really good as well.\nSumming up, I think that Switch was just an okay drama and it was entertaining sometimes. Just, don't expect too much from it.", "This drama was an excellent vehicle to showcase Jang Keun Suk's talent. His portrayal of two very different personalities was genius. Sa Do-chan, a doppleganger con-artist with a vendetta, gets recruited by the Prosecutor's Office when Baek Joon-su, a by-the-book prosecutor, is nearly murdered. For the remainder of the drama, the two end up \"Switch\"ing places to catch a white collar criminal whose fingers seem to be in every pot.I've read other reviews that say the drama was predictable. I do not agree. There were several plot twists, and enough action to keep me coming back for the next episode. While it's true there was only one big fish, he was involved in so many different schemes that it gave the story variety and kept it from becoming stagnant. The cast and crew delivered a well executed program that was well received, and fans of the series are crying for a season two."], "137": ["This drama is for us, who once loved poetry but now, not so much!When I first saw the genre, I thought medical + poetry? can't get along, so I shouldn't waste my time on this. But then I found a love story similar to mine, so I ended up watching it. And it was so refreshing that I fall in love with my Mr. Knightly all over again.I like the fact that the female lead is not a pushover and the male lead is not a jerk. cause we get it all the time in Asian dramas.But the humour part is mostly below average. I still had a good laugh time to time through main lead.And you ought to be a poem lover to love this drama. The way they relate a right poetry for the right situation and give us different messages or a warm feelings is actually really impressive and quite beautiful.I don't think younger people will like this drama as much. But I had a very refreshing enjoyable time and I will watch it again time to time.", "A Poem a Day is a medical drama with focus on the romance genre. The story involves doctors who work in a rehabilitation clinic, as well as nurses and trainees. We expecially follow the story of a young physical therapist, who meets her ex love interest in the clinic and falls in love with the new team leader. Now, the medical cases weren't that interesting, as they were short, few and didn't give us neither many information on the situation nor some closure to them. The romance, however was very nice with the love triangle slowly developing into a strong one. I do wish there were more episodes, though, cause the drama focused on the romance and didn't give many details on the other characters stories. But, overall, it was a sweet and cute drama, which I much enjoyed, so 8 out of 10."], "138": [], "139": [], "140": ["One of the best dramas I've ever seen. Excellent cinematography, actors, script, sounds and soundtrack. Beyond all the deep meanings that I felt during the growth of the various characters in \"My Mister\" there is a constant search for peace with the world and with oneself, there is a serenity that is disturbed and sought even by the monk who initially seemed the only one to own it. There is so much to say but it's all hard to put into words ... it is simply a wonderful drama, a must-see.", "I have watched all the episodes 4 times already.\nNothing more to recommend.\nWatch it and feel it.\nEverything is excellent from Directing, Writing, Acting and all OSTs.", "On Friday, April 27, 2018, I have finished watching EP12 of My Mister. This TV serial is indeed worth watching.On the whole, this TV series is highly fascinating and very attractive. The picture of this TV drama gives an excellent sense and quality feel. The OST is another main attraction. The actors' emotional performances are also in place. The makeup and costumes of the various characters are an important part of the plot development of this TV series. For example, the close-ups of her bare ankles and thin, dirty shoes appearing in various parts of the play, plus the fact which Lee Ji-an has been wearing shabby clothes, indicate that she is very poor and short of money. The dark eye sockets and swollen eyes also illustrate that the life of Lee Ji-an is miserable and depressed.\nIn terms of actor's lines, this TV series is still very excellent. For instance, facing a rogue property owner in EP4, Park Dong-hoon took advantage of his professional knowledge of the building structural engineer to speak out excellent lines, including the story of \"prison break\". Finally, he performed practical actions to make this rascal property owner to apologize to his mother and brother. In EP 8, Park Dong-hoon is a building structural engineer with solid basic construction knowledge and strong structural technical skills. When he was on his way home with her, Park Dong-hoon told Lee Ji-an not only about the contents of the work of the building structural engineer, but also described the relationship between internal forces and external forces in the construction structure. Thus, he derived the philosophy of life from the content of the knowledge of architectural structure. The lines are as follows:Lee Ji-an: \nWhen everyone knows that you are an architect in future, you must be asked to provide help everywhere.Park Dong-hoon: \nNot an architect, but a building Structural Engineer.\nAfter working here for so long, you don't even know what the company is running.Lee Ji-an: \nAren't they all the same?Park Dong-hoon: \nNot the same.\nThe architect is responsible for the design.\nBut building structural engineer have to think: if you want to construct the new building according to the design drawing blueprint, what kind of material you should use and how to do to make it safe. It is the person who performs calculation over and over again.\nAs literally speaking, it is the person who creates the structure.\nAll buildings are the struggle between external forces and internal forces.\nThe wind, the load, the vibration.\nCalculate all the possible external forces.\nThen design the internal force stronger than the external force.\nThe apartment should be designed to bear 300kg per square meter.\nA crowded schools or lecture halls requires to be designed a much higher load.\nOnly one level of dining room needs to be designed different loads for different places where people sit and where the weight apparatus are laid up.\nIt has always been necessary to design internal forces more strongly than external forces.\nLife is also the same.\nMaybe it is the war between internal forces and external forces.\nNo matter what happens,\nas long as you have internal force, you can hold on.\nThe characters of this TV series can represent various kinds people in today's society.Park Dong-hoon represents a class of people: It is a part of the middle-aged middle class that is under a lot of great pressure, but still struggling to live. In the plot of this TV series, he is a kind and considerate person who always wants to take care of his family and loved ones (not just his wife alone). He didn't want to tell his wife and other family members about unfavorable things what he encountered at work. Without no income problems, he still suffered from other sources from mental stress, causing him to live like a walking dead in daily life. The reasons for the above problems are:a. Park Dong-hoon had to provide for his elder brother and younger brother in need because they had a very poor life at that time.b. His marriage was under strain at the moment.c. His mother eagerly hoped that he would prove to be an elite in the family.d. In the power struggle within the company, Park Dong-hoon was marginalized by Do Joon-young who is a high - ranking officer, his college juniors and his wife's secret lover. The above points indicate that many problems can not be solved by money. These are the frustration of a part of the middle class. Looking at this type of crowd on the surface, the conclusion is not bad for all aspects, such as good work, good family and adequate leisure time. Even if they work diligently and conscientiously every working day, the troubles or misery of life given to this type of people are endless, so they cannot live a relaxed life.\nLee Ji-an represents a class of people: the bottom class of the society. In this TV series,Lee Ji-an is a very hard-to-reach young man with a callous face all day long, which is due to her heavy burden of life. Many time during working hours, she deliberately made the sound of the photocopier so loud that she irritated her office colleagues because of certain problem with the photocopier. Her colleagues asked her to take an A 4 paper, but she opened the drawer with her feet and asked her colleague to bend over to pick it up by himself. Close to the end of the working day,she stole the free coffee powder from the tea-room in the office unobtrusively with the purpose of serving as a part of dinner. At night she also continued to work part-time in the restaurant. While washing the dishes, she stole the leftovers and then took them home to eat. Even worse at the age of 15, she killed a loan shark who abused and assaulted her and her grandmother due to usurious loan. Today, Lee Gwang-il, who had inherited his father's debt collection as the loan shark, not only asked Lee Ji-an to pay back the money like an evil landlord, but also often beat her like a demon and even vowed to torture her forever. To fight against the harsh circumstances, she had the maturation that was not commensurate with her age and owned her inborn instinct wisdom. At the starry night when the moon is clear, Lee Ji-an smuggled her paralyzed and deaf grandmother out with the bed because she could not afford the cost of the sanatorium. In order to survive and because of the distrust of this society, she can basically ignore the corresponding rules when at works, but her heart is yearning for kindness. With the development of the drama caused by the merchandise coupon which was worth 50 million Korean Won, the contact between Lee Ji-an and Park Dong-hoon had increased gradually. Lee Ji-an understood Park Dong-hoon's kindness, tolerance and love for his family. Park Dong-hoon also knew Lee Ji-an's goodness and strength. For example, Park Dong-hoon said to Lee Ji-an, \"you are really kind.\" Besides, Lee Ji-an told Park Dong-hoon \"because he scolds you\" and \"because you hate him.\" They were guarding each other in their own way with mutual sympathy but without any trace of comfort. It seems that two people who are about to freeze could gather together to warm themselves up. In EP9, when Park Dong-hoon fought with Lee Gwang-il who was the loan shark due to Lee Ji-an's debt problem, Lee Ji-an eavesdropped on this scene through his mobile phone, and then squatted on the side of the road and cried. The plot of \" My Mister\" finally ushered in the first climax. For people like Lee Ji-an in the lower classes, survival has been the greatest victory and the rest things are luxuries.Wait for me to update", "Started watching this drama with no expectation, thinking it is just another slice of life drama. I have to say at the beginning like at least 5 episodes it did somehow feel as such, a drama that totally people in general able to relate to and even a bit slow, boring with the many conversations in between characters and with the focus on office politics. However if you stay on and immerse yourself into any of these characters as they move along with the story plot, I guarantee you will feel rewarded on the experience of what relationships between humans really are and how we are all just surviving and thriving (or failing) in the act of being in relationships with one another. This drama stays true to its theme on exploring and unfolding human relationships - love (also self love and care), belongingness, betrayal, forgiveness, acceptance, letting go, and I can go on and on because I'm amazed by the writer nim's ability to pack so many things in 16 episodes and yet it all fits accordingly and not overwhelming the story plot at all!The existence of the male MC, Park Dong Hoon in this story and the way it is being written really carried all the other characters so well throughout the plot - he is really just an ordinary genuine ahjussi, at some point in your life, you wish you get to meet in real life or perhaps you have even met such a person before. He has his own shares of life frustration but always chose to do things that would determine the outcome of what already happened (staying in control) and not wallow in what already happened (e.g., blame or accept his 'destiny'). His attitude of if you see it as nothing then it will become nothing and life goes on, is really a good learning point in life. Try putting yourself in the shoes of the female MC, Lee Ji An, and experience the tough life she had to go through (someone who accepted her 'destiny') and understanding her reactions and actions as well as what made her blurred the line between gratitude and romance because in the end how do we, as human beings express of our love to someone whom we see as angel sent to us and telling us life is what we made of, instead of destiny. This drama not only developed strongly anchoring on these two characters but also the entire characters in the neighborhood detailed in the drama. I see it as every single characters revealed in this drama are as equally important to showcase how we all influence one another when we gather together in our lives. From relationships among family members (siblings, mother-sons, grandparent-grandchild) to brotherhoods who stay in same neighborhood (the extended society family) to the 'family' at work and to the point that even a monk character speak volume in this drama - all depicting the sense of belongingness in human beings that is so reflective of reality world. Their interactions in this drama are gems, teaching you the many perspectives of life.I am just so grateful and satisfied with this drama that lived up to its title and for the writer nim who preserve the beauty of the relationship between the two MCs without tainting it with the usual reciprocating romance theme. The most memorable thing from this drama for me, apart from the awesome casts' performances, is to slowly decipher and digest the meaningful conversations between the MCs especially with the constant illustration using metaphors. Oh and the music and bgm throughout the drama are like, prefect to the core. The whole wire tapping and listening to the audio along with Lee Ji An - every single sound was crisp clear and really made it feel as if the audience is transported into it. Also up until now there are still various vivid scenes from the drama that keep appearing to me visually, such as the walk home at the neighborhood between the MCs and the subway train ride. This is definitely one drama that will leave a big impact to you if you take a chance to watch it. It hurts a lot at certain point to come to terms with reality of life but it hurts so good because that's how you grow to be a better person.", "For me, this drama is one example of a good package. Great story, great performances, great dialogue, great visuals -- all delivered in interesting & consistent plot. It tells you the story of every main character in beautiful-comedic-emotional-enlighten way, feels like watching 30+ eps great family drama in short 16 eps. Even tho, there was 1-2 exaggerated stuff, still I enjoyed this drama. The music score \"Grown Ups/Adult\" from Sondia shares the dark-and-sad vibe whenever it's played.

Not only focusing on human emotion within work, this movie speaks much about the basic fundamentals emotions of all human being such as family, happiness, sadness, decisions, fate, faith, bravery and much about integrity! Its hard for me to tell others what this movie all about since it have many life values and purpose within a single drama. Unlike other drama I had seen which usually has one main problem and has only one purpose or ending, this movie contain much of values and purpose.Subjectively I emphasize IU's acting as female protagonist in this movie is remarkable. I watched some of her movie she played which usually have happy and bright mood. In this movie she was very depressed and negative. I think all the characters can be played by other actor or actresses but the main protagonist it needs to be her since she has equal struggle to the characters. I like IU's character more than the real IU now. haha.The color ,script, and scoring of this drama need to be mention too since it has characteristic of many good korean movie which is dark and gloomy (like wailling, or old boys).", "I started K dramas mostly for romance and I won't be wrong if I say that I always go for genres that are listed as romance and comedy. But after reading the reviews and popularity of My Ahjussi I thought of giving it a try. When I started with it I was at the verge of dropping the show but I continued. And just after 1 episode I was hooked. My Ahjussi is not an easy watch and it won't be shocking if you cry bucket full tears as I did. But if you are looking for something deep with no- nonsense stuff then you need to be patient and watch this show.\nIt depicts humanity in the most purest form and the power of kindness. It has some of the most powerful dialogues backed with powerful performances by the actors. I was not able to point out a single plot hole in the whole run of 16 episode.

All struggling and wrapped in the curse and poetry of daily life filled with dark corners and moral choices.From the perspective of a Scandinavian viewer, the story is told with a strangely familiar \"Nordic Noir\" grip and is definately some of the best Korean drama I have ever wiewed.

They really envy the friendship of brothers who lost three brothers in the play.\n3. The tenacity of the hostess. The first half of the rendering is that kind of experience from childhood, warm and cold world, but with the image of grandma strong living. Let people can not help but feel pity.\n4. There are also all kinds of people in the same plot in the play. Although most of them are frustrated, there is always a passion of their neighbors.\nDisadvantage: The plot connotation declined too much, frustrated and retrograde.\n1. The plot of the upper and lower parts is very different. The first few episodes of intensive workplace struggle, a few climaxes passed, the rhythm of the whole story line fell apart immediately, and the whole story line was completely destroyed.\n2. Although the voice propaganda said that it was not a love film, the more the love between the man and woman in the back of the play, the bigger the role, watching is really depressing and sleepy.\n3. There are too many blanks in the end, and almost everyone is bad ending. The woman appeared to be out of the shadows but returned to Seoul without looking for a man.

Ji Ahn was a nice character. She was poor, and she had given up on escaping her situation any time soon. Her mister, the boss of her department where she works part time, seems a simple guy with family issues but eventually, everyone around him plot for his fall.

There were certainly some issues with the script and direction; with the plot and writing at times letting down a talented cast. The drama isn't tied to one genre, with it shifting between a darker mystery and a romantic comedy. This could be confusing to some viewers, but I was able to enjoy the way the drama didn't fit neatly into one definition and I embraced both the comedic and the dramatic scenes. The two leads had great chemistry, with Park Sooyoung and Woo Do Hwan delivering fine performances ranging from romance, comedy, and heartbreak. Overall I thought the cast was able to make their characters compelling enough to make this drama a worthwhile view and one of my favorites in 2018.", "It's reminds me of cruel intentions, pretty good so far", "The great seducer was one of those dramas that got everyone talking about. The posters and teasers were full of a dark spark, promising the best dark romance in the drama land. Seductive and aesthetical was the description as well. And then, Episode one was a dive in reality. It seemed more of an episode from gossip girl rather than what it was promised to be. The characters were rich, spoiled youngsters, playing drama with anyone. Plus, the \"great seducer\" had, like one (?) girl seduced and that was it. So, seducer was more like a title that everyone repeated rather than the real deal. So, one should expect that the big plot will play nice and with a slow built up so that the drama will keep up with appearances. Well, that wasn't the case either. The romance was developed so fast, that we spent the rest of the episodes lovey dovey or breaking up. Wasn't the girl supposed to be cold and not to believe in love? In addition, there were too many secondary characters, so many stories here and there, to, probably, distruct you from the main story that wasn't going as planned. But, they were boring too. Even the secondary love story didn't help. And there was the ending. I personally don't really like the \"five years later\" spin offs, but here we are, having one of those meaningless time skips, with no real ending. \nFinally, the acting was okay, and it did got a bit better, though, I think that Joy didn't fit her character. Maybe I see her more of the younger girl characters, in a more happy concept drama. I really enjoyed Min jae at least.

I had the feeling I was watching any US series which happend to have an all korean cast. First disappointment. I literally missed korean culture and tradition in this. \nUnfortunately, some people feel the need to westernized in order to become popular. Second. The title is very misleading. Thi show had nothing to do with seduction. We'll see the male lead seduce literally one woman in the first episode and and then just fall in love with another. \nThe whole romance happened so fast there was no time to catch a breath for anyone. The female leas is supposedly hate love and totally be against dating but here you go, seeing her head over heels in love with this seducing boy in just one day. I didn't see any romance developing. It just came from no where. Plus it was so cheesy I had pain cringing all the time. Another disappointment.We've seen a lot love going on then. The male lead transforming from this supposedly sexy, dark man into a shy, little boy. The female lead turned out to be all happy smiling and laughing about everything he says and does, taking selcas and stuff..... I mean how did we get there...Then it just went crazy. Fight after fight, followed by making up a day later, more fights, more breaking up and making up. One secret gets discovered another one comes up and right after that another. Ugh.... Of course one worse than the other. And somehow they all end up bleeding and crying, getting hospitalized, more crying and woops di doops there is a '3 years later\" spin off which I'm pretty sure we all hate. There is no real ending. No real confrontation about what exactly happened. It just... ended. None of the romances made much sense. Not even the secondary love story which I rooted for from the first episode. They've been probably the biggest disappointment. All the remaining characters bored me to death. Their stories were boring and everything regarding them bored me. So, you guessed it, I skipped half the show.Without the skipping I probably wouldn't have managed to get through this series. Even though the actors were really well casted and they delivered great performances. Moon Ga Young was pretty sure my favorit. She pulled off her crazy, broken, rich girl role perfectly (I must admit though she got really annyoing at some point). Kim Min Jae and his character definitely deserved more. I didn't like any of the adults. Especially hated all the parents. I didn't like Eun Tae hee's best friends. She wasn't really promising and helping and I find her rather annoying then likable. Nevertheless, it was okay to watch even if has a lot boring parts it had some decent parts as well. I'll give it a 4,5. It would have been lower but I loved Moon Ga Young too much in this and despite the fact that I was bored most of the time it still managed to make me cry a few times and it was entertaining enough to continue until the end."], "146": ["Every summer, the South Korean television industry puts forth the best and most promising shows and crosses its fingers that the public falls in love. Of course, not every show can be a surefire win; it can often take weeks before a show hits its stride, or they may just lose their momentum and drop off altogether. Luckily, this show is the one that makes the public fall in love more and more after each of its episode.\nInstead of the serious, bleak, and depressing atmosphere that recent South Korean police or detective series such as \"Signal\" or \"Secret Forest\", \"Live\" is very refreshing, heart-warming, and realistic. Just as the title shows us, this series does not heavily focus on police corruption or the police force's long, troubled history of misconduct toward the community it exists to serve. Instead, it paints a vivid, detailed picture of the police's daily struggles and how they overcome those day-to-day difficulties to fulfill their missions and somehow make their lives less miserable. These cops have to live their lives right, so they can help others live right. Again, this show does contain very optimistic underlying messages. It is relatable, especially for people who are in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. \nMoreover, what makes this show stand out is the acting of its cast, especially that of Bae Jung Woo and Jung Yu Mi, two of the most reliable actors in South Korean movie industry - Chungmunro. The soundtrack is awesome. The camerawork is good, too. All in all, this is one worth-watching show.", "I have watched many many movies and series in my life, even more since Netflix is on the scene, and I am honestly not easy to please - I have considered many highly acclaimed tv shows a waste of my (or any \"person with a brain\"'s) time and even little things that don't really bother most people can make the viewing experience a total failure in my book. \nSo when I say this, I really mean it from the bottom of my heart: Laibeu (or Live) is the best series I have ever watched in my life. I love each and every person on the team (yes, person - not character because if they are not real I don't know who is) and when one of them gets hurt, I sit and cry my eyes out as if it just happened to the closest friend of mine.\nI have one episode left to watch and I dread the end because I'm gonna miss them all so much. Or I'll just watch it all over again.\nWith this show, they have done nothing wrong and everything right, but they have done a lot more than that. I don't think I can explain it, I think you'll have to watch it. It's a heart&soul thing. It is something that develops throughout the series. Maybe the first episode is pretty cool.

I started watching the first episode and while the acting was excellent, the episode was a little slow and I wasn't hooked. That changed rapidly towards the end of the first episode. I ended up binge watching the entire series over a few days, often giving up sleep so I could watch \"just a few minutes more\". When I was done, I went back and re-watched a couple of episodes. Then I went back and binge watched the entire series a second time. This show is simply that good. I didn't want it to end. The show follows the lives of the members of local police station as they deal with issues while on duty and in their everyday lives. The stories are very well developed and the acting is excellent. As the show progresses, the characters grow in depth and you find yourself becoming emotionally attached to them and caring about their outcomes.

Then I watched \"Live\" and my whole world was turned, the emotional roller coaster that this series brings to viewers, even an hardcore people, will be brought to tears. The cast did a great job of bringing there characters to life, which you must also commend the directors and producers. I'm not going to ruin it and tell you any spoilers, all I can say is that you really need to watch it, I really hope there's another season in the making. Make sure you stack up on the tissues, because It will make you laugh and will make you cry, believe it when I say it's worth your time.", "I sa this show on Netflix Australia and instantly was addicted. Live is captivating and all the cast, script and songs are amazing, i actually could watch the season all over again and not be bored.

Now that I finished the show, I sure do wish we could get a second season!The cast did really well with their acting, especially the main characters; loved to see how they developed throughout the show to becoming stronger characters.The stories in-between the overall plot were also done well.The music and background tracks were few and I did notice them repeat a bit too much near the end since I've heard them a lot, and yes while they were really good it could be better with a slightly bigger variety of tracks.Definitely watch this show, you will have a blast!", "I have watched this because of Lee Kwang Soo but ended up falling in love with all the casts.

This is the country of complete oppression. In 1960's we saw North Korea as a poor but hopeful country. In fact, many Koreans living in Japan returned to North Korea to join the building of \"paradise on earth\". But since then, the country kept going downward. Nowadays they are isolated at the dead end. The reason why such country still survives is that by giving people at the power side extreme privilege, so that they want to keep the regime made of fictions.In such a country there is a family of the father, once a hero of soccer team, and his loving wife, and their son who likes soccer too. The atmosphere of the family which is poor but tied with love emphasizes how loveless the country is.In fact, looking at the officials of the camp or boarder security, I could not help wondering if it is possible for the same human being become arrogant and cruel like this. I feel some sense of impotence, because I can do nothing to the situation close to my country.This movie focuses on the fate of a family. This is beyond a propaganda movie to accuse North Korea, nor to glamorize the rescue group. This portrays the dignity of human being.", "I saw this in Korea over the summer (2008) at a special preview screening with English subtitles.It is a very powerful story that aims to depict the plight of ordinary North Koreans in the face of sickness, hunger, poverty, oppression and, inevitably, fear. The production is excellent, and the storyline is very believable - well, it is based on real events! In fact, you'll find many of the topics covered in documentaries made on N. Korea over the last 10 years - particularly those that include secretly shot footage smuggled out of the country. While there are elements of sentimentalism, it isn't overdone as it is in many Korean movies.However, there were a couple of minor annoyances:1. The bible cropped up early enough in the film, and I thought: \"Oh no, the director is going to spin some pro-Christian message later on\", but while this thread is returned to later in the movie, it is pretty much left hanging.2. The makers of this film couldn't resist making the main character a a former footballer (soccer player) of some repute. This was totally unnecessary and distracted somewhat from the credibility of the content. This needed to be a movie with ordinary characters in what is simply an extraordinary, but common, predicament.Nevertheless, despite these small annoyances, the film gets across its main tenet, and should leave no viewer unmoved.", "Initially, I agreed with one of the previous comments about the \"ex-football star\" background of the protagonist. The tidbit seemed cheap, unreal, and less authentic. The more I thought about it though, I suspect that the choice was made for two reasons: 1) to make the protagonist appeal to the rest of world, especially South Koreans, by creating this common interest (football/\"soccer\"). I think the world has a hard time relating to North Koreans. Americans and some South Koreans have this phobia of communist countries. Furthermore, North Koreans have been in a hermit state for a very long time. Very little is known or seen of the North Korean citizens themselves. The football thing was a simple way of making people realize that North Koreans are human beings, and in some ways they're just like us. 2) to show that the protagonist was not against the North Korean government. Well, at least not outwardly. I think this film did a good job of staying away from direct commentary on the N.K. government. Yes, the film paints the government in a bad light at times. That really can't be helped, as many of the scenes are based on true accounts. However, not once does the protagonist start ranting about how his government failed him. While there is heavy censorship in North Korea to speak against the government, the film could have had the protagonist 'think' these thoughts or discuss them safely with his family-- but it didn't. The main problem that the protagonist faces-- and that many North Koreans face-- is not that he resents his government (although, we like to think North Koreans do). His problem is that his family is starved, sick, and unable to find help in a country that lacks resources. For those two points, I have to applaud the film. I think it made a sincere effort to do what's best for the cause-- North Korean Human Rights-- and not just focus on what's best for the art.If anyone is interested in learning about how they can help, you can search the web for The Chosun Journal, U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, Liberty in North Korea, or Amnesty International's page on North Korea. Like any cause, donations are very important. But unlike most causes, I think the biggest challenge for N.K. Human Rights is that most of the world (and concerning, most South Koreans) ignores it. I hope this film succeeds in bringing more awareness to the plight of the suffering.", "Just saw this film at the PSIFF and was on the verge of sobbing. While I didn't forget how fortunate we have it in the U.S. compared to much of the world, this not-so-gentle reminder of just how bad things are in other parts wrenched my heart. Beautiful cinematography in such an otherwise ugly backdrop and overall \"setting.\" Outstanding acting performances support a movie of consistent pace and passionate portrayals. As I'm trying not to provide spoilers, let me just say you might consider bringing a handkerchief and you will likely go home to hug your young kids (if you have any) once the movie is over. Should this win the best foreign picture Academy Award, it would be no surprise. Solid film making techniques with subject matter that will stir even the most stoic souls.", "Having read Nothing to Envy by Barbara Demick, Escape from Camp 14 by Blaine Harden and The Aquariums of Pyongyang by Chol-hwan Kang & Pierre Rigoulot, I was very interested in finding a movie that dealt with the unfortunate realities of modern day North Korea as is detailed in the aforementioned books. I was not disappointed.Keurosing is a look at a grim reality that most people would rather just ignore. It's a dark, depressing journey. Anyone who has seen Grave of the Fireflies will know what I'm talking about. The movie is well directed and the acting is very good. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in North Korea and has read any of the books I've previously mentioned.", "This is a very moving movie about human rights and family relation. The North Korean government is so cruel to their citizens. The father in the movie escaped to China just for buying medicines for his wife. But, his wife died due to the short of health care. His son escaped to China after that. But he didn't make it, right before he could see his father. If I was that father, I would be crazy. He left home in the hope to save his wife's life. But actually, he made his wife died and his son tortured in the labor camp of North Korea and died on the way to find him. So sad.I am very glad to see so many international organizations helping those North Korean refugees to escape. How can I reach some of those? I wanna donate money to them.I suggest Chinese government to accept those refugees rather than deport them back to North Korea. They will be killed! I also don't agree with current US ways on treating Mexican illegal immigrants. They are just so desperate. They are hungry.

It really sounded simple, a family has struggling to live at NK, problem comes out, family separated in order to search for hope that seems impossible at North Korea, etc etcBut after execution, its way more different than what i expected, the synopsis and movie descriptions are too simple to describe it that you have to watch it yourself.

But no, this movie reminds us the harsh cold truth, that there are a lot of people who had high hopes, they've seen the lights at the end of the tunnel , even many times. But at the end, even when things seemed to be able to get a happy ending, it ended terribly, and all those hopes were nullified to 0 at an instance. I didn't see that ending coming.", "Life in North Korea is far from easy. The political situation is devastating, with a combination of lack of democracy and a very difficult economical situation. This could've permitted a skillful director to shoot a film that criticizes all these things. But the film fails to be realistic and it seems like a pure propaganda. Let me explain it: the regime is depicted using unnecessary violence, as if all the officers are villains by nature, and enjoy torturing poor people, especially little kids. The buildings looks like two centuries ago. Social care simply doesn't exist at all. All we see is soldiers who oppress, and misery. This exaggeration backfires, it is simply unconvincing. Technically the film is not better. The main characters are caricatures. The acting and the direction are awful, the story is not at all convinsing. It is very strange that the IMDb rating is so high...I cannot recommend this film, it reminds me some blockbusters shot during the Cold War...", "I happened to be invited to a human rights event where the people were showing this film. Originally I wanted to see it because it was about the extreme human rights violations in North Korea. I'll tell you, this film has such great performances and such a profound soul, that you just can't help crying/balling. Well-acted, well-edited, well-paced, it never lets you off the hook. South Korea's leading actor In-Pyo Cha plays the father in what is essentially a father-son tale played out in exquisite but heart-wrenching detail. If you're into stories that express the fullness of human experience this is one worth experiencing. It will haunt you and alter your perception of freedom and everything else you hold dear. I read someone's complaint on here that the father should not have been a soccer/football star... but that's such a pointless criticism for the sake of criticism.

But, the first episode said it all. The pace too slow, the performances so so, the story boring, the romanct weak. When the background story kicked in, I told myself that this was it, the drama was taking off finally. Alas, that never happened. Turned out, that twist was boring too. Okay, the whole drama wasn't as terrible, but, for me, it's a drama that I wouldn't recommend."], "161": ["It's too bad that because this film is ostensibly about an old lady it must be considered a \"smaller\" film in Bong's oeuvre. It's not. It is every bit as brilliant, and as large, as Memories of Murder, in my opinion.In many ways this is the natural, and equal, follow-up to Memories of Murder. It's every bit the caper film that one was, and, although slightly more somber in tone, the film keeps unraveling in directions you don't expect making it much more a plot driven movie than a character study. Kim Hye-ja is, however, magnificent as the titular (gawd I hate that word but I'm using it anyway) mother. There is a scene in this film where she tells the family of the victim her son didn't do it and her eyes are so electrically charged it made me jump back from the screen. Mother fires on all cylinders. The direction, cinematography, script, and acting are all grade A. It's one of those films where each of the secondary characters steals the show for a brief period. (How 'bout that cop who kicks the apple from Won Bin's mouth?) Bong does a remarkable job of populating the world of this film with real people and manages to give them depth and development in a very short period of time. I confess to having a little trouble tracking the other female characters in the film, but no matter. There is a scene (without spoiling anything here) where Kim Hye-ja asks the other 'retarded' kid if he has a mother and it's one of the most complex and heart-rending scenes in cinematic history. Hyperbole notwithstanding, just freakin' WOW! on that one when you ponder just why she is crying.I wasn't sure where Bong was going to end up going as a film maker. Barking Dogs Never Bite was a reasonable debut. Memories of Murder, a masterpiece. But was it a lucky shot? I'm glad I don't have to consider the dismal Antarctic Journal a Bong film if I don't want to. The Host was lots-o-fun, but that's the one that worried me. Maybe he was going to start making blockbuster type films. But now, after recently seeing his contribution to Tokyo!, and now Mother, I have every reason to believe he is going to kick my butt with interesting film for a long time.", "Joon-Ho Bong is one of the most exciting and wonderful storytellers coming out of Asia today. With Mother, he joins with Chanwook Park as being one of THE young South Korean directors to see - by that I mean anything they put out. Bong's work is layered with the skill of comedy and drama, both often so dark and thick that you can put your hand in and not feel the bottom. His previous film The Host showed his talent at making a 'popular' entertainment, a monster blockbuster that actually gave characters to care about while action and terror ensued. But this time he returns to his second feature, Memories of Murder, in crafting a murder mystery that is ultimately, in the sense of the details of the story, hopeless, but carries so much joy and passion in its making that I left elated by the performances and cinematography.It is, from the look of the premise, pretty simple stuff. A kid who is sort of 'simple' (not really retarded, just slower than the rest of the pack with a bad memory) is charged with a murder of a teenage girl found hanging over a rooftop. He says he didn't do it, or at least doesn't think he did, and his mother believes him. But finding out what happened won't be easy, and the police (as in Memories of Murder) just want the confession quick, which they get from Do-joon's misunderstanding, and move along to the next case. So, the Mother goes on a mystery, like a detective first tracking his shady golf-hustler friend, then going on to who this girl who died actually was, what her connections were, who, if anyone, saw what happened when her son stumbled home drunk that fateful night.All of the details, seemingly straightforward. It's all in the presentation of the details, and it's this how Bong sets himself apart as an original: taking elements of film-noir and Greek tragedy, of a mother trying to save her son, and by proxy herself, and warding off the \"chorus\" of a strange and untrustworthy townsfolk who shun her after the incident. Oh, and like in other Bong films there's some touches of pitch black humor- watch for that interrogation scene of the teenage punk on the ferris wheel, or how that crazy hit-and-run happens at the start of the film- but it's either subtle or pronounced so large that one almost puts it down to hysterics. But while Bong navigates the black-comic elements well, it's his skill as a Hitchcock-cum-Chabrol idolizer that makes it a must-see.This is suspenseful film-making, from the overall arc of finding out the details of the crime, to little moments that are just suffocating. Take when the Mother goes to search the complex lowlife Jin-Tae's place to find possible proof that he committed the murder. She has to hide in the closet when he comes in (Blue Velvet much?), and watch as Jin-Tae and his girlfriend have sex. Later, she has to exit ever so slightly, and knocks over a water bottle. Every second of this counts, and it's thanks to Bong's trust in the view to be lead along, and go for the tension, that makes it work.Other things that make the film so exceptional are more technical, and emotional. The performances by Hye-ja Kim and Bin Won are moving for how they appear to be, then little by little how they show who they are, and more importantly what they're capable of. The final reel of the film shows the characters, and by proxy the actors, having to go through some rough motions, and a twist that makes Oldboy look, well, almost on-par in comparison. Kim is sensitive, tough, smart, but also knowing of this Mother's faults as a person, that she may have a little of the 'simple' side of her own son, and the secret her character carries, when reveals, is shocking. And Bin, playing a simple kid with some deep-rooted problems (and, of course, never call the character 'retard'), makes him human and relatable, or as Kirk Lazarus might put it \"half-retard\".The cinematography, lastly, is a knockout. Scenes like the opening image of the Mother in a field doing an unlikely dance to the diegetic music, and then how the DoP manages between light and dark in those night scenes, or the subtle scenes like when the lawyer has the Mother at a drinking party that goes sour fast, are just beautiful and strange to look at. This may, too, be a credit to Bong as a director. Again, following along on his previous films, he grows as a patient storyteller, ready to let the details or action of a scene go slowly, but also ready to let the actors take things to BIG emotional plateaus. It should be noted that Mother does go into some melodramatic beats, sometimes very heavily, but it's never at a cheap shot or angle. Mother is a harrowing film that treats its characters seriously, but also gives time here and there to observe how awfully bizarre some of it is. It's one of the best of the year.", "In a province in Pusan, South Korea, the slow Yoon Do-joon (Bin Won) is a young man overprotected by his mother (Hye-ja Kim) that works with acupuncture and herbs and does not like his worthless and reckless friend Jin-tae (Goo Jin). When a Mercedes runs over Do-joon, Jin-tae follows the hit-and-run driver with Do-joon and find the car parked in a golf club. Jin-tae breaks the side mirror of the car and Do-joon collects golf balls lost in a lake. When they see the cart with the driver and passengers of the Mercedes, there is a fight and they end in the police station. During the night, Do-joon walks to the bar Manhattan to meet Jin-tae that does not arrive; when Do-joon returns home, he sees the easy Moon Ah-jung (Mun-hee Na) walking alone in an alley and entering in an abandoned house. On the next morning, Ah-jung is found dead on the terrace of the house. The incompetent detectives find a golf ball near her body and they conclude that Do-joon is the killer. Doo- joon is arrested; signs a confession and is charged of murder. However, his mother follows her instincts believing that her son is innocent and the scapegoat of the incompetent police department and seeks the truth disclosing a dreadful reality.\"Madeo\" is an original and dramatic South Korean thriller that has an engaging story with a surprising plot point and many twists. The director Joon-ho Bong of \"Gwoemul\" makes a simple but effective film with a credible story of a single woman that does everything possible and impossible to prove the innocence of her son that is slow probably because he was poisoned when he was five. The performance of Hye-ja Kim deserves a nomination to the Oscar in the role of a dedicated loving mother that pursues the truth about the murder of a teenager student. With the exception of one review of a user that probably has difficulties to read subtitles; the nine wins, six nominations and the favorable reviews of twenty-three IMDb users are practically an unanimous indication that \"Madeo\" is a great film indeed. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Mother - A Busca Pela Verdade\" (\"Mother \u2013 Seeking the Truth\")", "Was looking forward to this film after enjoying the director's earlier films, Memories of murder, The host n Snowpiercer.\nThe film is about a mentally challenged kid who is also being overprotected by his single mother who is a specialist in herbs n acupuncture.\nThe kid is arrested n charged with the murder of a young girl but the mother believes he is innocent n she goes out to prove his innocence.\nThe best part about this film is the acting by the lady who played the mother.\nAnother good aspect is the details.\nWhen the dead body of the girl is kept on the terrace of a dilapidated house for the whole town to see, we as viewers really wants to know the reason n the reason is explained towards the end well suiting.\nThe direction n cinematography were brilliant. The only problem was the editing. Found it to be a bit slow n long.", "Bong manages to capture some of the poignancy of motherhood in his film Mother, which concerns an elderly single mother (played by Hye-ja Kim) and her son Yoon Do-joon (played by Bin Won). Do-joon is mentally disabled, he has a low intelligence and seems to have problems with his memory. His mother is absolutely devoted to her son. Bong throws light on that extraordinary capacity of some women to totally subjugate their own lives to those of their children, who live for the pep that they get seeing often unappreciative family members troughing their way through their latest offering.Do-joon is framed up fairly early on by the police for a murder that they can't really be bothered to investigate thoroughly. So mum is on the case, you'd better believe it! This involves for example bringing in drinks for all the members of the detective bureau on a visit to the precinct. There's a lot of tragedy in the movie, but it's offset by a comedy that is at times is almost outrageous in it's manipulativeness, Bong's really being directly provocative at times (though not in a salacious sense)! There's a grand surreal scene at one point where he convinces you that a very minor character is going to perform a deeply uncanny suicide, and then something totally banal happens instead. One of my favourite scenes is a scene on a golf course where a shot dollys across to some action taking place in sugar-white bunkers, which would not be out of place in a Fellini movie.Bong was playing with my emotions throughout, he set up affiliations between me and other characters only to subvert them or rebuild them later, he builds scenes to emotional explosiveness just for the sake of it. The film leaves you emotionally confused at times, Bong's smashing all the buttons on the telephone, and so you don't really know what number is being dialled. The effect is deliberate.Bottom line I think it's a celebration of motherhood, but it's not sugar-coated, it's really warts and all. Congratulations Mr Bong!", "Yoon Do-Joon has an intellectual disability. His friend is a bit of a trouble maker. His mother is always worried about him and protective to the extreme. A young girl is murdered and the lazy police of this small Korean town blame the obvious and helpless Yoon Do-Joon. The police interrogate him and make him sign a confession but Yoon Do-Joon is not really aware that he is signing his entry to prison. The mother, confident about her son's innocence will investigate the case and will go to any extent to free her son.After the success of The Host (2006), Joon-ho Bong has crafted an intimate slow burning thriller with suspense elements that is contained in a small town, with small characters, but has a great scope. This movie is more similar to his first two movies, which I highly recommend. Hye-ja Kim is excellent as the mother. Her performance is understated but at the same time intense, cold and at the same time powerful. The cinematography is beautiful. The film moves along and builds slowly, more akin to the tempo of the small town we're visiting for the duration of the film, but the twists, turns, and suspense make it a highly rewarding and satisfying ride.", "After a night of drinking, Do Joon (Bin Won), an intellectually-challenged young man, encouraged by his reckless buddy Jin-tae (Ku-jin), attempts to pick up a young high school girl Ah-jung walking home alone. Shockingly, the next day, Do Joon is arrested for the girl's murder as his mother looks on helplessly. Seen at the Vancouver Film Festival, Bong Joon-ho's Mother is an intelligent, suspenseful, and darkly comic revelation of the lengths to which an overbearing but deeply loving mother will go to pursue justice for her son who, she believes, has been wrongly convicted of murder.Though there is an evocative score by Lee Byeong-woo, the film's use of ambient sounds such as the slashing of Hye-ja's herb chopper and the rustling of leaves add to an ominous mood, though it often clashes with the absurdist events seen on screen. Set in a small Korean town, the elderly mother, played by Korean TV star Kim Hye-ja in one of the most nuanced and emotive performances of the year, makes a living by selling herbal medicine and providing illegal acupuncture treatments. Convinced of her son's innocence, she will stop at nothing, even violence, to find the real killer. She learns details about the dead girl's personal life and talks to alternative suspects, even though even she is not fully prepared for the twists and turns that her investigation will take.The film opens with a shot of a lone elderly woman walking in a vast expanse of open field, reminiscent of the opening shot in Shunji Iwai's All About Lily Chou Chou. As she approaches the camera, the background music becomes rhythmic and the woman begins a strange, almost provocative dance. The scene then shifts to her business where she is keeping a close eye on her 27-year-old son Do-Joon who she feels needs her constant protection. Playing in the street with a dog, the boy is knocked over by a speeding hit and run driver in a Mercedes-Benz.Uninjured, Do-Joon and Jin-tae chase the car to a golf course where the two attack the drivers of the Benz with sticks while collecting numerous golf balls, later to be used in evidence in court. On the fateful night, after Do-Joon is thrown out of a bar for being drunk, he pursues Ah-Jung home and the next day is arrested for murder, although details of what happened are murky. Bong shows the police procedural as in Memories of Murder to be on the lackadaisical side and conveys the impression that everyone involved is only out for their self-interest, including police, lawyers, friends, junk dealers, and schoolgirls.Reminiscent of the quirky, offbeat films of Alfred Hitchcock, Mother is an intense, witty, and engaging psychological thriller with enigmatic characters that do not just populate the screen but are vitally alive. In one outstanding scene that will etch itself forever in your memory, Hye-ja attends the funeral of the girl her son is alleged to have murdered. Although besieged by distraught family members who think her son is a murderer, she has the fortitude to look them in the eye and proclaim \"my son could never do something like that\". Although \"barking dogs don't bite\", this woman is one \"mutha\" of an exception.", "Bong Joon-ho's new film is built around actors. The starting point of it is Kim Hye-ja, 'grande dame' of Korean acting (around whom the screenplay by Bong and Park Eun-kyo is built), who gets a chance to break away from the long-suffering, boundlessly loving mother image she maintains in the long-running \"Rustic Diary\" TV series to embrace a juicier, darker, richer role. Likewise Won Bin, whose pretty-boy looks have gotten him gangster and perfect son casting, here becomes the slack-jawed, unpredictable Do-joon, a \"retard,\" not taken seriously by most of the town, but zealously protected by his apothecary mom (Kim), who even sleeps in the same bed with him, though he's 27. Both the mother's and son's roles are challenging. Kim Hye-ja shows an incredible emotional range within a de-glamorized exterior, and Won Bin subtly side-steps dumb-guy shtick, managing to keep Do-joon lastingly unpredictable and mysterious.Do-joon has a run-in with the police after he and his friend Jin-tae (Jin Gu) hassle some fat cats at the golf club after one of them hits Do-joon with his Mercedes and doesn't stop. Simple Do-joon brags about being at the police station, but then gets drunk, brooding about the way Jin-tae ribs him for being a virgin and wanting to get laid. Then that same night Ah-jong, a schoolgirl, is found with her head bashed in and Do-joon becomes the prime suspect. His case seems hopeless, but his aging mother, convinced that Do-joon would never hurt a fly, takes it upon herself to conduct her own investigation of the case, which neither the cops nor the fancy lawyer she has engaged are interested in. This story carries its mother-son relationship well beyond the usual. There is no extent to which this mom won't go to protect and exonerate her son, and some of the memories that are dredged up are troubling indeed.In some aspects 'Mother' reaches back to Bong's 2003 '80's-set police procedural 'Memories of Murder,' particularly to its sensitive development of a small-town milieu. But this film is also full of comic aspects like the director's later international success 'The Host' (2006, also a NYFf selection). The focus on mysterious, isolated people relates to the main character in Bong's top-drawer segment of the 2008 'Tokyo!' trilogy, \"Shaking Tokyo.\" Cell phone cameras, autographed golf balls, and acupuncture also play key roles in the story, which is full of interesting twists and turns. A major turnaround comes from Do-joon's bad-boy friend Jin-tae, whose true role we have no idea of at first.Bong explodes the image of the ideal mother and as usual, bends genres in this new effort. At times this might seem a twisted psychological thriller with links to Douglas Sirk and Sam Fuller, and the occasionally old-fashioned movie music by Lee Byeong-woo, traditionally surging at key points, reinforces that impression. Ryu Seong-hie, the production designer, has worked extensively with Park Chan-wook, and d.p. Hong Gyeong-pyo does a superb job in integrating the looks of a wide variety of locations. This is highly sophisticated Korean cinema at its technical best.We can't possibly reveal the outcome: the essence of 'Mother' is that its plot is packed with surprises. Perhaps indeed there are a few too many: the last ten minutes introduce further twists after the surprise climax that might better have been omitted. For all the great look, terrific acting, and explosive plot twists, I'm not sure this is up to the best of Bong Joon-ho's previous work. It's fun and entertaining especially at the outset and watchable throughout, but Bong and Park's screenplay meanders a bit. The film's inclusion in the 2009 New York Film Festival may owe more to timing, to the bloom that's still upon Korean cinema, and to Bong's status as an alumnus of the festival, than to the film's intrinsic merit. (Hong Sang-soo, a NYFF favorite, despite a new film that's received raves, is omitted this year. His 2008 NYFF Paris-based entry was somewhat lackluster. . .)Bong's 'Mother'/'Madeo' was included in the \"Un Certain Regard\" series at Cannes, and shown as part of the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center 2009._________________", "Film loves evil, the vile, the inept, the perverse and the innocent defamed. All of this is in the brilliant film \"Mother\". One of the greatest faults of Hollywood is the complete omission of this type of character (I can't reveal who), and this amazingly scripted piece of horrific, monstrous human behavior takes tremendous advantage of the fact that WESTERN film makers lack the guts to do this story. It helps American viewers that both the setting (a small town in Korea) and the actors (complete unknowns to this viewer) all create a clean slate for us to experience this level of depravity and pure and utter darkness of the human spirit. I just saw Chloe, and believe it or not, the films are similar. Both use a strange and mundane setting. Both films dig deep into the hollow lives of these characters, bereft of love and even the most elemental human contact and affection in their lives. And both films point out the sheer perversity of the modern human spirit searching for this love we all dare to desire. Nothing is missing from this absolutely brilliant tour de force of human rendering that will leave you in disgust and awe. After all, what are movies for? If you don't want to feel the fear and trembling of this kind of human tragedy, we should all just sit home. This movie is a masterpiece.", "Well this was a big bag of depression. Great movie though.A - one might say overly-devoted - mother goes to great lengths to prove that her mentally-handicapped son did not murder a young girl. It's an interesting setup for a thriller but not unique, so what makes the movie so good is really Kim Hye-ja's performance as the titular parent - the dedication to which she throws herself into her investigations risking danger and suffering abuse, and the devotion that she shows her ungrateful son. Oh, and the disturbing Oedipal scenes, yoiks. Cinematographically, this movie was quite captivating too. There is much to admire in Bong Joon-ho's capture of small town South Korean life and he's also skilled at scenes of suspense - witness the mother tiptoeing past the sleeping gangster. A simple scene but full of tension.", "If you're familiar with Bong Joon-ho's works, then Mother comes without surprise at how he deftly weaves a story about mother's love into a mystery thriller that will keep you guessing every step of the way, with enough emotional firepower to twist a knot in your stomach when the truth gets played out. It's a standard three act structure here where the first hour establishes the strong family bonds between Mother (Kim Hye-Ja) and child Yoon Do-Joon (Won Bin), bordering quite close to being incestuous (but this is glossed over since we're dealing with a man-child here), before they key murder scene beocmes the catalyst for Mother to do some serious investigations work in order to prove her son's innocence, given that the perverted justice system provided that bad after-taste.I particularly enjoyed the epilogue, which ties in with the inexplicable opening credits which made more sense once you've come full circle at the end. It's the classic mantra of two wrongs never making one right, and how in the protection of loved ones, one will resort to extreme measures that blind common, good sense, and become a \"rather you than me\" syndrome, which I believe every one of us are capable of if we find ourselves pushed to a corner with no where to run. Bong Joon-Ho is again at his element in unravelling the investigations process, which ties in black comedy with painful, dramatic moments, being evenly paced with heightened tension at appropriate moments.And kudos of course must go to actress Kim Hye-Ja, who almost single-handedly carried the film on her own, since Won Bin disappears mid-way through. Her single mom, with so much affection for her son, just dazzles and makes it convincing that she's been that single pillar of strength and shelter for her son when he gets up to shenanigans brought about by no good company of his. It's not the first time Do-Joon got himself into a fix, given the strange mannerisms he's been taught to try and jog his memory, and Won Bin showcases his acting chops as the dim-witted boy whose disability gets frequently exploited, coming off as endearing at times, so much so that you're quick to judge and side with him as a victim of circumstances, being at the wrong place at the wrong time.Mother is definitely recommended stuff, especially if you're a Bong Joon-Ho fan as he delivers yet another powerful film that will leave plenty of post-screening discussion.", "Only a film seen so much perfect was 'The Shawsank Redemption' back in 1995.Its amazingly focused, awesomely directed and what a heavenly story!, i have seen a lot of twist and turn movies (most of them gets boring in the middle)but this is something out of here..u will admire every scene!I loved 'Shawsank Redemption and The Dark Knight' didn't find time to give them ratings but this movie forced me to give it a Review 10/10 in IMDb. And by the way if this Movie would have been made by Hollywood, it would have got Oscar, but it got only 8.1/10 in IMDb because its Asian, come on Americans??? Sorry for my grammarJust Watch ! Definitely Recommended !!", "As quirky and original as you'd expect from the South Koreans. MOTHER is a lengthy mystery film featuring an unusual storyline about a mother who seeks justice for her unfairly imprisoned son. Along the way, there's all the kind of bizarre supporting characters, atypical incident and genuinely surprising plot twists that you'd expect from a Korean film. This is a movie that keeps you watching throughout despite the slow pacing and lack of action.The character development is excellent: fully natural, low key throughout, and thoroughly involving. Unsurprisingly, the actors selected to pay the various characters are just right for the part, particularly Hye-ja Kim who we only ever know as 'mother'. She's a unique choice of lead and fits the role perfectly. Won Bin, who made an excellent action hero in THE MAN FROM NOWHERE, is equally excellent here as the slow-witted son and he really gets his teeth into the part.MOTHER may be a slow burner of a film, but it has a subtle way of truly involving the viewer in the storyline. The tension builds as the climax nears, and then the movie hits you with some moments of quiet devastation that prove a shock to the core. Fans expecting another pulse-pounding thriller like THE YELLOW SEA may be disappointed, but those with open minds will have a ball.", "This is a decent film with a good plot line. However the delivery is slow and could be better. The lead character who plays the Mother, typifies a classic maternal figure. She dotes on her son and is constantly worrying for, and nagging her son. He sleeps next to her every-night and the son is the Mother's world.When her son (the brilliant Bin Won) is accused of murder, the Mother fights for his justice and attempts to seek out the truth. At this point the story goes through a slow pace and a series of clues and knowledge is gathered, but the viewer is left wondering where this is leading and how this is going to progress.Suddenly, the last half an hour of the film, the plot begins to get interesting again and we see the true characteristics of the Mother which is superbly portrayed. The conclusion of the film is somewhat shocking, but, on reflection of the entire film, is not surprising.Overall, this has a good plot and is definitely one to watch, albeit slow moving at times.", "So recently going on a S.Korean film rampage (Memories of Murder, Oldboy, The Chaser, etc) The more I watch these S.Korean thriller movies, the more I admire how brilliant these films are compared to the typical Hollywood movies out there. Their movies are always original, creative and exciting to watch. To have a senior women starring as the main role in a crime/thriller movie is undoubtedly unique and definitely not what one expects within this type of genre. But it works, and works exceptionally on a whole nother level. Most murder mysteries in typical films involve engaging the audience in uncovering the complex 'truth' that keeps us guessing until the end. But this film is different, completely the opposite of what one would expect, similar to that of the ending of \"Memories of Murder\". It's not simply about finding out what really happened in the crime scene, but rather a shocking twist to how people can change as a result of the crime. It really puts you in the shoes of the mother, you could feel the mother's emotions as the film progresses. When you watch this film, try not to think so hard, because you'll be in one heck of a 'wtf' moment.", "If this had been my first movie of Joon-ho Bong, I would have given it straight 8 or 9, but the truth is, it never even touched the standard set by him in \"The Host\" and \"Memories of Murder\". I'm not saying it's not good,but the thrill was gone. Characters and plots are reminiscence of John-ho Bong's previous work \"Memories of Murder\". Rainy and cloudy weather doesn't support the plot as much as in his previous movies. It can stand on it's own as a very good thriller and it's unfair of me to judge this movie on the basis of his previous work, but I am a bit disappointed. The best thing about the movie is acting by the lead character \"Mother\". 90% of the time she is on screen, and you wouldn't complain about it.", "From the ratings I was looking forward to watching this but unfortunately it left me a bit cold. It is well acted and filmed but it never sustained my interest for the full two hours. It would have been a far more effective film if half an hour had been cut from it. Although quite tense in places I expected this to be far more sustained than the odd scene. The story I found to be quite predictable and unsurprising. I wouldn't put anyone off watching the film as it's certainly not a bad film but it just wasn't for me.", "Most storytellers want to take you somewhere into the soul, but all they have to work with is the externalities, the actions of humans. You don't have many strategies to work with. A common one is to place the examined soul in the midst of larger forces, war for instance. Then there is a certain \"fold\" between the inner and outer flows that when the two merge, allows us as the outer viewer to join the inner story.Alternatively, the storyteller can have us invest in a relationship between our focus and someone else, a relationship so drawn to open a relationship with us, through which we swim into the intended world. That is what has been done here.The \"other\" character is a brain damaged young adult. He is in a way a non-person, without the ability to be an agent in a story. He has no forward thrust. As it happens, he is the cause of something significant in the story without understanding. The fact that he is without story, unable to observe, changes our relationship with the usually simple narrative dynamic. We are placed between them.This is a profoundly affecting drama as a result. Unexpected things occur, and we experience them not as we would, but as she does. Our first image of her is inexplicable, she is in a trance, dancing in a field. Only toward the end of the film do we catch up to that point, knowing the context. Something transformative has happened and when we revisit it, we see it from the inside.Powerful filmmaking, in part because of the expert manner in which the ordinary dynamics are handled. In part, this is because the filmmaker has tricked us into investing in a way against with we have few protections.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.", "ALERT: SPOILERS AHEAD! This is a poorly scripted Korean mystery thriller that seems to have impressed everyone else posting here; the only naysayer before me was only complaining that it wasn't up to the genius previous work of Bong.I'm certain that know-it-all IMDb-ers will reject my P-O-V, but here's some key points that need to be raised by a non-sycophant. A good, let alone great, thriller needs careful scripting & direction to maintain the audience's state of suspending disbelief -this is a key element of greater importance than say, in the case of a slice of life kitchen sink film or a drawing room comedy, where very little out of the ordinary occurs.By having unbelievable coincidences as key features to the story's progress, Bong lost me completely. I will focus on a central series of scenes where all narrative believability falls apart. The schoolgirl is showing Mother how she adapts a cell phone for \"spy\" use, as they sit in a cafe. Outside the window two boys obviously spot her. When Mother's inquisitiveness raises suspicion, the girl sends her out to the drugstore to buy emergency tampons (!), as an excuse to make a hasty exit. As expected, the girl is gone when the Mother returns, yet she immediately (and oh so conveniently) finds the girl nearby being tortured in an alley by the rather guilty-seeming two boys, only to be miraculously saved by a brutish adult who is angered by their despoiling his space in the alley: territorial imperative. Soon after Mother is presenting her son's untrustworthy (but helpful) best friend with a vast wad of cash. He had previously requested she use his text message to get the money \"settlement\" directly into his bank account; she has another wad of money she doesn't give him, BOTH sums of money are impossible to explain in her possession since she's destitute, and director Bong, presumably with scenes deleted for eventual DVD bonus use, never makes even a token effort to establish the money's existence as credible. With the money in hand, her son's friend gruesomely (for gore-hounds' enjoyment, Bong having a horror movie following already from prior work) tortures one of the boys for information. All of this is nonsensical storytelling -utter garbage, incompetently written, structured and directed. I daresay if this film were not on a pedestal as a subtitled \"foreign import\" but merely a U.S. B-movie, this reject scripting would be ridiculed by the same clowns, including brain dead critics and film festival program directors, who praise MOTHER.Late in the film, after searching the site for perhaps 8 seconds, Mother's son finds the incriminating acupuncture box which he presents to her in a \"reveal\" near the end of the film. This is ludicrous scripting -the director DOES NOT play fair with the audience the first time around in letting us perhaps see (or through sleight of hand misdirection not realize we are observing) the boy finding the case. A hack director could show the boy idly picking something up but through his mise en scene not show us what it is; that's how you set up the later revelation properly. It is highly improbable that the admittedly incompetent authorities (much of this nonsensical film is built on the premise that the local police are the most dimwitted on the planet and incapable of acquiring or processing evidence) would have not noticed the case with infinitely more time to observe the fire scene than our hero, and the state of conflagration of the junkman's hut renders the virtually intact (not mint condition, but nearly VG+) state of the acupuncture case and its contents as pure hokum.That reminds me of the biggest cheat, which make comparisons of this junker with any classic (or just classy) mystery film of yore, let alone Hitchcock, ludicrous, being the presentation of the girl's murder in the first place. It is a total audience fake-out; we see our hero suspiciously pursuing the young schoolgirl around corner after corner, see her disappear in a side way, the heavy rock is thrown out at his feet, but the editing offers no hint or fairness in terms of the later revelation (by the junk dealer, which we have no reason to doubt since we the audience AREN'T the hero's Mother but supposedly objective observers) that the schoolgirl had a key conversation with the hero at this point, leading to him assaulting her. I object to the omission of ALL this key material -of course, the director shouldn't show us the murder early on, but the pre-murder material must be presented in a fairer way to be taken seriously. Remember Hitchcock's emphasis on suspense -Bong is all about surprise, with most of the violent scenes and other morbid buildups taken right out of the horror play book: shock cinema. Destined for a contemporary audience that unlike its ancestors, film buffs who used to care about credibility, will uncritically swallow anything, believe anything, and forgive anything dished out by today's crop of hack, ultra-hack, and mega-hack directors.", "Before watching this film I got online and read several reviews like I always do, to get a feel about what i'm about to see. From what I read I was very excited about the film, several people were comparing it to Hitchcock and saying what an incredible thriller it was, and many people praising it so highly, that after a few pages of reviews I thought I was preparing to watch a cinematic triumph. Well, I have NO idea what all those people were talking about... it's not some great thriller or mystery, it's not even a good thriller or mystery...I kept reading about all these great twists, none of which I found were much of a stretch. Now don't get me wrong, it wasn't a horrible movie by any means, it had some bright moments...great performances, some good humor, cool cinematography, but I'm just warning you, don't go into this movie believing your about to see some great mystery thriller, or you'll be greatly disappointed...when it ended, it was one of those \" you got to be kidding me\" moments.", "\"She'll stop at nothing,\" reads the ominous tagline on the poster of Bong Joon-ho's latest cinematic triumph \"Mother\". I remember seeing Bong's thriller \"The Host\" (the one filmed documentary-style where a giant octopus threatens a city) and I didn't think much of him as a director; sure, the movie was interesting and thrilling enough, but it didn't make it great or memorable. One year afterwards he turns up with \"Mother\" and quickly establishes himself among the greatest and most respected of foreign directors. I mean, how can I sufficiently give honor and credit to such an intelligent film? In one year, Bong has managed to mature cinematically and challenge audiences worldwide with a film that's deep, VERY thrilling, intelligent to a tee and indubitably important.The film's short title and its ominous tagline tells us a bit about the plot: obviously, it's about a mother who'll stop at nothing. Duh. The mother in the film is nameless, perhaps so we can identify with her and her unending quest. Played to perfection by Kim Hye-ja, she's an over-protective, extremely affectionate woman who sells a variety of herbs and medicinal plants and who performs acupuncture to her rich customers on a South Korean city of no name. Her son, Do-joon (Won Bin) is one step away from retarded, mild-mannered and all-around silly; we fail to identify with him at the beginning and go as far as to condemn his passiveness. In his stupidity, he hangs around with a local tough guy named Jin-tae, who's his best friend, and who accompanies him to the local country club to collect stray golf balls whom Do-joon plans to offer as a gift to a girl he likes. From the beginning scenes where a car runs over Do-joon and Jin-tae goads him into wrecking the culprit's car on revenge, we know their friendship is flawed and the latter can do nothing but lead the poor retard on a wrong path.Well, it so happens that one night Do-joon gets drunk and, as he goes back home to his worrying mother, he follows a girl down a seedy path looking to have sex with her. She ignores him and he returns home, as planned...but on the following morning, the girl is found dead on a rooftop and one of Do-joon's golf balls is found near the scene of the crime. The police guesses he's guilty, they present him with a document where he pleads guilty which the silly Do-joon signs in his na\u00efvet\u00e9. Having accepted the guilt for the crime, he's imprisoned, much to the rage of his affable mother. She knows him better than anyone and is SURE he's not guilty, but the police won't hear otherwise, and she has no money to entice a lawyer into thoroughly investigating the case. So, like any concerned mother, she starts playing detective around town trying to solve the mystery behind the girl's death so she can acquit her son. But as truth after disturbing truth is uncovered, our protagonist finds that 'she'll stop at nothing' to save her son's freedom.The film shines. The many technical aspects (such as the muted, ominous score, the perfect editing and the cinematography) aid in making this an interesting experience, but the REAL triumph behind the movie is a) the clever screenplay and b) Kim Hye-ja's flawless acting. First, the plot thickens and thickens to insurmountable depths, and it leaves virtually no plot-holes; it's a well-devised mystery unlike any I've recently seen. And second, Kim's performance of a cunning, methodical, calculating mother truly deserves an Oscar nod. Every second she's on screen she turns up the thrills. We can't help rooting for this enraged mother trying to protect her son, even as the mystery leads her deeper into a web of violence and murder, and the depth she gives to her character alone make the goings-on all the more nerve-shattering.I can't say more about the plot because I might give away some spoilers, but trust me when I say every single scene, every single character counts, and Bong Joon-ho has gone meticulously through the film to present us one of the most exciting thrillers ever. John Powers from Vogue calls it \"darkly funny\", and I have to agree. Even though it is a detective thriller, it's enriched with some VERY dark comedy (seasoned with cinematic irony and social commentary) that will have you meditating on the absurd nature of crime scene investigations. Not only does the movie present you with a swell story, but it touches on themes such as crime, prostitution, no-secrets towns, the stupidity of our youngsters and, most importantly, the zealous nature of mothers towards their sons. Few films manage to exact surprised laughs from us at the same time that it keeps us riveted to the edge of our seats, our minds shattered by what we see.I recently discovered this was South Korea's official entry for the 82nd Academy Awards last year (2009), and I am enraged to see it wasn't nominated in the end. A film of such power and such depth shouldn't be overlooked, and quite frankly, I'm appalled to see films like \"Mother\" be snubbed from the Oscars (even Italy's excellent film \"Vincere\" was snubbed and overlooked for other films like Peru's \"La Teta Asustada\" which, even though it was very interesting, doesn't reach \"Mother\" or \"Vincere\"'s height). \"Mother\" is a film every thriller-lover should watch, and I can assure you it won't be easily forgotten.Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!", "I had doubts about this movie early on; it started slowly and felt like a wandering indie drama. So I looked at a few reviews to see if I should keep watching, and found all these raves saying it was Hitchockian and full of twists and turns. So I thought, well, it must get more interesting. And yes, if you slog through the first hour, it does get more interesting. The story picks up, and in the last half hour there are a couple of moderately surprising twists and some genuine intensity.But comparing this to Hitchcock is just weird. Yes, the score has a bit of Hitchcock in it, but the movie is nothing Hitchcock would do; it's more of a wandering mother drama tied around a murder case rather than a suspense movie. I know the director has made genre movies in the past, but I think if a different director not known for such films were to put this same movie out, it wouldn't even be described as a suspense film.The movie also has one twist that is completely unreasonable. A similar twist was used years ago in a mystery book, and it was castigated as unfair, yet it was far more fair than the way it was done in this movie. It's not really a twist at all. A twist is when you are lead to believe one thing and then you get a new perspective that makes you see it differently. This was just a cinematic lie, and not remotely clever.The movie is watchable, and because it gets progressively better as it goes along, I have a more favorable impression of it than if I'd given up during the tedious first half. If you could edit the first hour of this movie into about fifteen minutes, you would have something short but pretty entertaining (but still unfair). Overall this was just a waste of my time.", "'Gwoemul', by the same director as 'Madeo', was one of the best monster movies I have ever seen (although it's a been a few years), his 'Memories of murder' was a terrific thriller, and 'Barking dogs never bite' was a pretty good drama. And so I have been anticipating this one rather eagerly for quite a while.It's certainly not a bad movie, but somehow it disappointed me a little. Maybe it has to do with the mother, who remains elusive at all times, even if the title already gives away how as to we should look at her, and that it simply indicates who the main character is / should be.The other points of view, through the son's eyes and several other supporting ones, and the fact that the story plays with the facts of a gruesome murder case, demand a lot of attention as well, which takes away some of the focus on the most important character: mom.These are just some ideas that I have about why I feel that this is my least favorite Joon Ho Bong movie, but it may very well be a more intuitive thing for me, also. The movie and story simply didn't grab me as much as, especially, 'Gwoemul' and 'Memories and murder' did. It felt dragged out too long and was too depressing maybe, even for me.A good 6 out of 10 it deserves nonetheless, at the least (fine acting, cinematography). And maybe I'll try it again some day.", "So we want films that challenge, engage, but don't waste the engagement on a trifle gasp. It's easy to unsettle, a murder or rape; the real challenge is what next? How do you open us up? This one's a great example, but you'll have to wait for the last scene. A few things are first established before the crucial crime. A hit- and- run introduces random agency in a world where violence can swoop down from nowhere and wreck lives. The altercation with the broken car mirror is for us to understand that the savant boy is an unreliable narrator, susceptible to stories. And his relationship with the mother is portrayed to teeter between the merely awkward and the unacceptable, so that we first have to struggle with our own selves before we can empathize with either.And then it becomes about us. How we are susceptible to stories, unreliable narrators of what we witness. How empathy is a matter of inheriting a story as though it was our own child in it, going on faith. Do we believe the guileless boy as his mother does? Do we trust that he remembers when he does? Our own visual testimony? It is about us having to struggle to empathize. About us, having empathized, being uncertain of the judgement. This is a hard earned empathy, not Spielberg's mushy one where cute lost boys face obvious evil, evil here being the inability to even know about it. \u2014 it's really vital to realize that the boy's original impression of the crucial scene is his own 'real' subsequent memory of it, the event having been reconfigured into view in just the way we first see it. It confuses because that is what he recalls having happened, he's not lying. \u2014 the important discovery of the victim's cell phone leads to a story that trickles to the mother through three levels of narrators, the victim inside a (stoned) boy's memory being told to a third person. The phone itself is full of pictures of men, each one potentially the culprit. \u2014 later in the film there is a reconstruction of the original scene of the murder, as the savant finally remembers a man in the house, and this man is later found and gives his own testimony. This is so good it's worthy of the photo reconstruction scene in Bladerunner. \u2014 this recalling is marvelously framed through windows and unclean glass. At its most pure, the film is this glimpse through hazy glass at a troubled boy trying to remember, it's about moving walls around to create that space where something horrible happened. \u2014 the film begins with an image of the mother, at that point simply she's just a middle-aged woman to us, inexplicably dancing in a field. In the end we know at what point in the story this takes place but the gesture remains wonderfully ambiguous. Which brings me to the last scene. The whole film is meant to appeal to a broad audience, though it presents by no means simple and uncomplicated truths. But the last scene is one of the most striking I have seen. Great cinema begins where drama and metaphor end, it's hard to describe what that next step is, in short we'd say transcendent. The context of narrative is always illusory, it is the opportunity for us to be aware in a certain sense. This is why it doesn't matter what's the answer to the mystery in Blowup, or why the hayloft barn ablaze in Zerkalo is not encountered as the result of any logical causation.In the last scene we have that step beyond causation into ambiguous air. The mother has been sent off in a bus with other middle-aged people. She prickles her knee with her acupuncturist's needle, hitting that spot \"that eases the heart\". See what happens in the film. What is the urge that lifts everyone from their seat? There's a lot of great Asian cinema I'm being exposed to lately, and that scene is the third most captivating in an Asian film of the decade I've seen, all three involving physical activity of some sort as transcendence, two of them dancing. Find my second favorite in Sharasojyu.", "\"Mother\" is an alluring piece of work, an artful mystery that melds clever plotting with resourceful camera work, with sympathetic characters that are fascinatingly morbid. South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho follows his monster extravaganza \"The Host\" (2006), in firm control of his medium in a different genre, proving once again that conventions need not always confine.After a night of drinking and waiting for his long time friend, Do-joon (Won Bin), finds himself in some serious trouble. The next morning, he is accused of murdering a young woman on his way home from the bar, and he has no recollection of whether or not he did. The case has enough evidence to be closed quickly, but his mother, played by Kim Hye-ja, refuses to believe that her son could do such a thing. So she pushes forward, not accepting what the police have pieced together, and starts her own investigation to find the real killer, and free her son.The film is a labyrinthine and cleverly deceptive, and not in a way we might anticipate. Long after a conventional thriller would have its destination in plain sight, \"Mother\" is still penetrating our assumptions. There are twists are aplenty, and deductions achieved too easily are simply the result of contrived clues and convenient witness testimony. \"Mother\" delights in confounding viewer expectations. In fact, just when you think it's over, a couple more developments still remain.The film progresses with remarkable clarity, while drawing surprise and suspense from unexpected places. It's director Joon-ho Bong's unique style of old and modern approaches to filmmaking -- his stylistic and subtle ability to weave this story, and employing a witty use of dark humor throughout is what makes this film so impressive. \"Mother\" slowly burns its way towards revelations and depths of a character's soul that most dramatic thrillers shy away from. The most surprising aspect of \"Mother\" is how differently it begins, and from that, what it becomes. Unique and utterly compelling in its entirety, \"Mother\" concludes in a manner that solves all (or nearly all) outstanding riddles. \"Mother\" deftly weaves a story about mother's love into a mystery thriller that will keep you guessing every step of the way."], "162": ["Vanishing Time: A Boy Who Returned is a South Korean fantasy drama that convinces with an intriguing story mixing fantasy and reality with great acting performances despite a few minor lengths in the middle section. The film has a lot of depth as it deals with the topics of friendship, life and trust in a gripping way. The two main characters are authentic, dynamic and sympathetic and most viewers will care about their fates until the very end. The camera work is accurate and slow, the light techniques add a lot of atmosphere, the Locations are mysterious and original, the soundtrack underlines the movie's atmospheric parts and even the special effects are gorgeous yet down-to-earth which is a perfect mixture most Asian fantasy movies fail to achieve.The story revolves around the friendship of two young outsiders that most viewers might identify with because they are both profound, sympathetic and resilient. Su-rin is a teenage girl whose divorced mother died and who has moved to an island with her stepfather. She doesn't really get a long with her busy stepfather, fails to make new friends and is often seen as weird because of her interest in the occult. She's a creative, emotional and smart Girl who even develops a secret sign language. Sung-min is a joyful, optimistic and quirky orphan boy who has a crush on the mysterious girl that is so different from all the others. He works very hard to get closer to her and gradually develops an intense friendship and even romantic relationship to the older Girl despite his friends' negative comments. One day, the young couple and two teenage friends discover a mysterious cave in a forest where they find a shining egg in a hidden lake. When Su-rin returns to the cave to look for a lost hairpin, the three boys break the mysterious egg and provoke a supernatural event that will have immediate, short-term and long-term consequences for everyone involved as well as for their families and the island's small community. Telling you anything more would take away from the creative plot.While the event that kicks the story off is a supernatural one, the rest of the story is particularly realistic and has a strong emotional, philosophical and psychological touch. Heart-breaking moments and thoughtful passages meet brief moments of hope and joy. The story remains interesting until the end that some might see as a happy and others as a sad ending which makes it even more interesting depending on your point of view.Vanishing Time: A Boy Who Returned is a particularly great movie for intellectual teenagers because of the two brilliant main characters but anyone who likes profound dramas or thoughtful fantasy movies should give this clever film a fair chance. Once again, South Korean cinema has managed to create a profound teenage movie that easily beats Hollywood's current wave of teenage movies around the Hunger Games or Insurgent franchises.", "Started watching this film very late with the intention on continuing the following day. Ended up staying up very late to watch the entire thing as the film just sucked me right in with it.I'm a big lover of South Korean cinema and surprised this one slipped by me, especially as it was released in 2016, a standout year for Korean cinema. I feel this film drops a multiple of genres in to it without losing itself in the process and often keeps us wondering. As this film has yet to receive 1000 votes, and you happen to come across this review on this site, don't waste any time and watch this film as soon as possible.", "There's nothing left to say about the Korean film industry. I've already praised highlighting all the best stuffs. One thing they lack is the awards winning capability, like perhaps the Oscars. Cinematically and entertainment perspective, they always give a top notch product. Particularly, the kind of emotions they use, is very closely appeals to my culture, probably for the rest of the world as well. All I have heard about this was a fantasy film. Beyond that, it was a little romance, a little emotional and a little thriller.There are a large number of people outside the South Korea follow the Korean films. Though this one is definitely an under-noticed a great piece of work. I don't know this director, but he wrote and made it pretty awesomely. This kind of tale very much suitable for anime. It's going to be just like another 'Your Name'. If they decide to make it with the small changes, I'm absolutely on to it.The title is not really enchanting for a fantasy film. But definitely makes sense on what it narrates. This is a fantasy film, though, since time involved in it, it automatically a small part of science fiction too. They had well covered all the loopholes and flaws. They did not detail out all minute things, but if you think little intelligently, you will get all the answers for your doubts. For instance, how that asthma boy had died.From a small Korean island town, the story followed a teenage girl, Soo-rin who recently moved in there with her stepfather. She was considered a weirdo in the school for being lonely. Then a boy named Sung-min befriends her and become girlfriend-boyfriend. One day they along with two other boys venturing to the nearby mountain forest, discovered a glowing object. In the next minute, everything has changed. All of them disappeared, except the girl. Now the town is enraged by her little story.\u275dLet me grow to 6ft. Earn $10 dollar before age 30.\u275eNobody knows what had happened, including Soo-rin, until a man who approached her telling some strange story. She finds a reason to believe that, but not anyone else. It goes on like they are fighting to tell the truth to the world, but it was beyond reality. Adds more complication every time they try to explain it. Without any options to solve it, where the remaining narration heads and ends were told quite nicely, emotionally.The story was simple, but the details makes is more complex. Easy to follow, there's always an explanation for everything you see. Contents wise, it is a well balanced for children's and the grown- ups viewing. Whenever a film theme involved messing with time, it has to be very clever. Because time naturally does not exist in the universe. It is the human's creation to understand everything's existence. I think they have designed this story with the characters so well. It could be a time travel theme too, if you take it from a different perspective.Two hours long film, but that did not bother me. Because I well merged with the story. The twist came early itself as the storytelling demanded it. But there were many turns in the later parts. Especially the entire second half is less excitement if you are a fantasy film fan. Though it gets tense for every scene, and creates curiosity about the conclusion. Not the best ending, yet very suitable one. What I am impressed with it was how smartly they used the graphics. They did not require higher end. Simple and believable visuals, compared to Hollywood's similar style flicks. One such interesting fact was, they wanted the story to lead the film than the colourful graphics.Nice performances. The locations were good too. There are some moments that reminds other films. Nothing like it stole from them, though for the similarity in the thematic and the situations. The overall film theme was not out and out fresh. It simply changed a few rules and with the kind of development, it created its own identity. As for me, this is one of the top ten fantasy films of the decade and top ten in all time Korean fantasy film. As I said, if you love this genre, then it is a must see. Highly recommended!9/10", "It took me a while to finally pick this movie up to watch, after watching other more recent blockbusters. In hindsight, I should have watched it when it was released. I could easily place this movie as a romance - in the end, it depicts what sacrifice one would make in order to save his loved one. Very good story telling, not a moment of dullness and really engaged you into the story till the end. \"Time\" is indeed the most precious and valuable asset we all have.", "(spoilers) Korean film \"Vanishing Time: A Boy Who Returned\" (Korean translated), was a great watch on a recent plane ride for me - probably the best off all the movies watched during the ride. Director Tae-Hwa Eom has put together a well done and tender drama ribboned with fantasy and a bit of science fiction. The movie excels on the strength of its main child actors especially Eun-Soo Shin, and although it follows some of the concepts of \"Big\" and \"Vice Versa\" it is obviously more contemporary than those earlier American films. Editing and cinematography are competent. The filmmakers spend the extra needed time developing lead characters to give the us roots and investment in the characters and then takes off into fantasy. Although a 2016 film, one of the better movies I've seen this year. Recommended 8/10", "The Koreans do wonderful work in romance, fantasy, and time slip, and this film also combines the Korean sensitivity with portraying children and young people. Even so, the film has twists that move it beyond sci-fi and more into explorations of time, love, devotion, sacrifice, and more. Also, the writing, direction, and actors are all excellent, and I was swept in from the beginning by the relationships between the kids, and then the two leads' sensitive portrayals of their characters in a difficult transition within the story. My only reservation is the ending seemed rushed, which can be an issue in some Korean films and dramas, but it does work...just a bit flat IMO. Still, I do strongly recommend this little jewel.", "A beautifully shot movie with an unusual sci-fi plot, highly recommended to all fans of the genre. It starts slowly but once fantasy elements kick in it is really worth seeing. Much better than 'Will you be there?' that came up the same year.

The story is vast and interesting, it seems to have a lot of genres built within itself - comedy, horror, romance. That being said - the show is most likely for the younger audience. The only obvious flaw(s) that I can think of is music - they've recycled the same song 5 times in the first 2 episodes which was disappointing.

The great acting and the interesting plot that stays true to Sun Wo Gong's character are the main point why this drama receives high rating after Goblin, still the ending and the actress are much preferable than Goblin.

The difference of upbringing, culture and worldview, that's why I liked this drama. The actors were beautiful, so I have great respect for them for their work.

Korean Odyssey has so many stories embeded in it, and whether the main story was just so so, with some intense romantic moments that were lost in the length of the drama, as they were too thinly spread out, the many characters that were likable and interesting helped keep it entertaining. Again, though, the romance was a bit tiring after a while and the drama itself is tiring as well.

I waited until my eyes were dry again to write down my thoughts on this. First of all before starting to dug into the material I want to thank and curse at the writers at the same time. They've given me a very hard time. I was so stressed out especially at the very ending I think my face was rather covered in sweat than actually tears. But it wasn't a disappointing ending, thank god.This is my first time I've seen anything about the actor Lee Junho and I must admit I have fallen in love him. His performances were beyond great. I felt every single emotion he potrayed and he actually made me forget that this was only a drama. Searched him up right after the first episode and found out he is not only a talented actor but also singer (goals).As for the actress. I was suprised to find out that this was her first lead role in a drama. She did a very good job I believe. Still...and I'm really sorry to say this but I'm just not quite sure of her acting. I believed it was very good in the beginning. Later on it became somehow a little annoying and I'm not sure if this is because of her character or the writers but she seemed dull and emotionless which I seriously can't stand. Even if you have to play emotionless you should show emotion. I mean you should show us something. One more thing that bothered me was her stiffness especially in scenes involving kissing. \nThe first time I didn't notice. As for the second and third time. But at some point I felt like Junho was kissing a corpse. She did not only look really uncomfortable and stiff doing it but she looked more of a corpse. Girl, like move a little, show some emotion. Don't make THAT face. She literally made a face. I was disgusted and this is my first time noticing something like that. I've seen a lot of actresses be a bit stiff during kissing scenes but this was on another level. \nI really liked her in the beginning but toward the end she became annoying. I think that is more of the writers issue though since they're the ones creating her. However it wasn't as terrible as it sounds. I still like her as a character and have seen far worse characters in dramas. I had my issues with the second lead Seo Joo-won (Lee Ki-woo) was BORING AS HELL. I'm sorry but everything regarding him bored me to death. I started skipping some of his scenes but at some point I even stopped doing that. That's how much he bored me. I also didn't like him. He was unlikable from the very beginning. I'm probably the only one thinking that he was actually really selfish and a coward.Kang Ha-na's character Jung Yoo-jin was so dull and annoying. I really think I'm the only one that did not like those two characters. They both were so emotionless, boring characters, they deserve each other.I absolutely hated Gang-doo's sister. Sooo unlikable. I hated Moon-soo's mother and father. Both of them were horrible parents. I couldn't find anything in them that seemed like they were good people. I loved Ma-ri (Yoon Se-ah). Her character was very interesting. She pretended to be this strong woman whilst being very vulnerable and already broken.\nI liked the actress and loved the character.\nI LOVED SANG-MAN. And I'm not saying this because he has a disability, no. He was really a great character. I really like the actor too. \nSame goes to the grandma and suprisingly I liked the director Jung Yoo-taek (Tae In-ho). He is actually a total a**hole but somehow I felt like he was just raised wrong and deep down he's actually a really interesting character. For some reason I never hated him. He did some ugly things but he still managed to be likable. Plus he was really funny.I actually loved the story. It was really realistic. I felt the pain and struggles of the characters but there were too many unnecessary flashbacks especially showing the same scenes over and over again. At some point it became really stressing though. I felt like we didn't get much romance. Rather, we had a lot of scenes boring people talking about boring constructions and boring contracts. I mean it started to get as if I was watching a documentary. I really hated the fact that the whole show was about that damn memorial and yet we didn't get to see any of it. Less construction site and S-Mall crashing flashback scenes and I would be totally happy. But those got really annoying (seriously. were the writers architects???) Still the show managed to grab me, mostly because of Gang-doo. His story and character just spoke out to me and I loved that we've seen more about his life than Moon-soo's.Acting was generally very good, writing was pretty good, cinematography could have been better but was enough. Overall a must watch for someone who seeks out a good melodrama because this is IT. (I cried my eyes out)I'm removing one star for boring characters and their boring construction site talks.

All I can say is that I'm a K-dramas fan since 3 to 4 years maybe and have watched roughly 45-50 Korean dramas but I can happily say that this once tops them all regardless of consisting of only 4 episodes. It was a rollercoaster ride of laughs, tears and emotions during watching it. What a perfect storyline and everything, and hats off every single actor in it especially the main character In Hee for her marvellous acting. In short, I'd just end this review by just saying that I'm truly happy that I watched it and could have rated it more than 10 if I could.

Really love it.", "Phew, the first few episodes in particular are beautifully done so you absolutely have to keep watching till the end. The premise is intriguing yet it's the chemistry between the leads that is compelling ( yes, a truism regardless of the language ). Seung-Ho Yoo is goofily cute yet heartfelt as the recluse, while Soo-Bin Chae as the robot is SO adorable, you just really want the best for her. Both actors also handle the emotional stuff well ( & it's gruelling for the viewer when the drama and tears kick in ! ).\nNow, though I do love the show ( & desperately want to marry Ms Chae ), there are some gripes : the humour of the early eps tends to reduce somewhat, despite a plethora of opportunities right through. Most of the other characters could do with some personality ( the butler could be a football fan, or the 2 assistants to the robot scientist could fantasise about the \"kissing\"expert, who is underutilised anyway ); While the production values are solid, I'd add some visual oomph ( eg slo-mo, dissolves, ECU's, funky editing etc ). The final scene is, hmm, frustrating ! if you've been waiting 2 years for the love of your life to return to you, surely you'd be jumping into their arms & smothering them with kisses ? \nThat said, there were regular examples of a scene or a line surprising me, which is always a good thing ( eg the relationship between the head scientist & his female assistant ).\nAnd finally, the elephant in the room : the S word. Apart from one extended kissing scene which should've been broken up with some humour, we have a fit young man ( despite the allergy ) who seems to have NO sexual interest in his gorgeous GF. Please ! Is all Korean TV so chaste and unrealistic ? And no, I'm not proposing a full-on HBO approach. It'd be so easy to be subtle and just SUGGEST things in a funny way ( \"hey Mr Chairman, there seems to be a bulge in your pocket\" ). So, memo to Korean Govt : sex is here to stay & is very enjoyable, as you seem to realise per the sexy babes in every 2nd K Pop video. With Hallyu in mind, the rest of the world will embrace KTV better if you inject a bit more realism into the TV content."], "176": ["The backstory is not that good.

I expect that it will follow the familiar formula where the leads hate each other at first, are forced to work together despite their personal feelings, and over time learn to respect each other and eventually fall in love.\nThat's not to say that it can't still be a lot of fun; I mean, formulas are formulas because they work. What I like most about this drama at first glance is the casting, and the way all of the characters seem to be people who know who they are and don't try to be what they're not. Yoon-yi puts on the stereotypical competent, loyal secretary mask while at work, but in her personal life she's messy, foul-mouthed, and slightly annoying even to her friends. Chi-won is, of course, her polar opposite: judgmental, overly cautious, rigid, and resistant to any social responsibilities. It's going to be entertaining to watch them clash, mostly because I think that Baek Jin-hee and Daniel Choi are nailing their roles so far, fully committing themselves to their characters' wide extremes.\nYoon-yi, who is a fun mix of organized and hot mess. I understand the need to be super organized in your work persona, leaving nothing left when it's time to go home. She seems like the kind of person who is good at her job because she's dedicated and driven, but she's also prone to bursts of inadvisable emotion, where she lets her feelings get the best of her and acts out in ways that could be harmful to herself and others. Kicking someone who's showing concern for you, even if you're in a terrible hurry, is pretty awful, and I don't blame Chi-won for being disgusted when he witnesses her being insincere at the funeral, then turning around and demanding sincerity from him. Yoon-yi may be a competent secretary, but she's driven by her instincts instead of what's right, which is something she's going to need to fix.\nChi-won seems to have a very centered (if overly rigid) moral compass, making his lackadaisical attitude towards his job feel very out of character.\nThere's definitely some nepotism going on in this company, though I'm unsure yet exactly where everyone stands. Vice President Do's treatment of Chi-won seemed very fatherly, and Yul is obviously not a managing director because he earned the position. Why they're both working for YB Group, and why Chi-won in particular doesn't seem happy about it.", "With all these fantasy dramas out there, Jugglers was kind of refreshing. At least, at first.

Some of that has been alluded to by at least one other reviewer. One set of characters (no spoilers here) are a squad of police detectives who are somewhat inept, but in the first episode, that is a bit overdone, coming off a bit too much like \"slapstick comedy, gone very, very wrong\". It just seemed a bit too childish. But, based upon the IMDB reviews, and score, I went ahead and watched the next episode, which led to me quickly being addicted (and the Episode 1 silliness did not recur). There are just a continuous set of \"hooks\" (revelations) that keep you wondering what is going to happen next, and those are all part of a larger story that is woven together, revelation by revelation.Although there are a handful of core characters, this is one of those stories where you have to pay close attention, as the underlying story is a much larger canvas than is obvious up front, and as more details are revealed, and events from different timeframes are woven into the story, there are a lot of \"things\" to keep track of (both people and events). Certainly, it works better, IMHO, to be able to watch the series in a shorter timeframe (e.g. binge-watching it in chunks), just because it has so much going on.It is the fact that most of the ongoing revelations are not so much \"adding pieces to the puzzle\", as they are \"turning the puzzle on its head\", that makes it so interesting. Those regular \"twists\" are also not unrealistic, i.e. (IMHO) they aren't just ridiculous, unlikely plot devices. There are often flashbacks that show events as they happen, to further weave those ever-growing plot elements into the larger story. Again, some of those flashbacks involve the same characters, at different ages, so you need to pay attention in order to tie everything together. (Much as with another really great series, Dark, you can't be sitting on the couch, texting on your phone, while you attempt to watch this, or you will quickly find yourself lost.)Anyway, I'm obviously providing no real details about the story, to avoid any spoilers, but suffice it to say that I believe that anyone how watches the first few episodes, will either find themselves as hooked as I was, OR, they will simply decide that it's not a story that interests them at all. Just don't bail out instantly, after the first episode. Its initial tone is simply not representative of the larger story being told.

I have seen many series that are similar but Black had me blown away. The first episode reeled me in and before I knew it, I had finished this series in less than a week. The suspense, the action, the romance, and the acting was superb. I applaud the writers, producers, and actors for doing an excellent job with this series. I have never felt so many emotions. I'm in desperate need of a season 2 now that it ended. I'm not sure how that will be developed but it would be great to see the actors act again. SSH and Go Ara tugged at my heart. The chemistry was out of this world. It made me hurt for them. What an ill-fated love. I really do wish that the ending wasnt rushed. As a romanticist, I really wanted Black and Haram to be together. How can they deny us of that when the relationship was building up? It was disappointing to have to see that she had forgotten everything and passes away as an old woman. This ending was bittersweet.Maybe, there would be a season 2 to explain more in depth of how Joon became a grim reaper again when he has ceased to exist. And why he is still in the body of Moo Gang. It doesn't feel right. Maybe there shouldn't have been ending. Maybe the ending we saw is just Joon's dream of what haram's life would be like if he never existed but it didn't go as planned. When he had requested that he never existed, it was too late. Haram had jumped and her soul was already collected and he meets her in the underworld but she doesn't remember who he is and from there the series explores the underworld, the life of grim reapers and him trying to bring back her memories. Ahhhhh, I'm too invested. This series has gotten me worked up. I do hope that there is a season 2 with the same characters. Doesn't have to be a sequel, a spin off would be great too. Just keep the same actors! Black wouldn't be Black without the characters. It gave life to the story.I apologize for such a long review but I have to express how excellent this series was. I'm glad that I found this show. It may be confusing at first and the ending may not suffice with many, but overall the show is undeniably one of the best kdramas I have ever watched. I highly recommend watching it before judging based on reviews. Everyone has their own opinion of this show but I can guarantee that this show will live up to your expectations. I never write reviews about any shows that I have watched before but this show needed a review to showcase how exceptionally well done it was.

Also, if Ha-Ram's dad was a grim reaper in a dead body, why did she see a shadow only at that one point (when he was wearing black, btw)? She should have seen it all the time. And why didn't she see the shadow inside him? And if it was a grim reaper who had discovered him (the shadow), wouldn't they have just snagged his rule-breaking butt and left? \nAnd, how did the murderer \"kill\" Ha-Ram's dad anyway? Moo-Gang just shook it off when he was slayed horrifically by a meat hook by the SAME GUY. SIGH. The acting was stellar, the chemistry was good, but when you have problems like that in the consistency of a plot, it makes it really hard for the audience to suspend their disbelief and just enjoy the story of an ill-fated love between a grim reaper and a girl who basically is, of all the Charlie Browns I know, the Charlie Browniest. The first half was funny and sad and reeled me in, the second half I spent confused, frustrated, and dreading the wrap up. They brought the audience into a micro view of a great story, then pulled so far back, none of the characters that we grew to know and enjoy were even in the final moments. I don't know, in the end the drama affected me; it touched my heart and forced me to contemplate uncomfortable thoughts about life, and death, choices, and consequences.

Love.", "Our story begins telling the 'greatest love story' of Princess Pyeonggang and OnDal. We then cut to modern day, on a film set, creating a new take on the old love story. Soo-Jung is starring as the princess, however when something is changed in the script and she doesn't know about it, she throws a huge tantrum. And so we are introduced to our main character; a stubborn and easily provoked actress, known as Korea's 'top star'. Due to certain events she drives off in her car and is magically transported back to the past into the time of the Princess and OnDal, and must figure out how to return to the present whilst trying to deal with love and war.The best thing about My Only Love Song was definitely the characters. Soo-Jung, OnDal, Sam-Yong, and Il-Yong were all hilarious. A few of the characters I found annoying were the princess and the two guys who fawned over Il-Yong but overall the characters were great. The flashbacks in the final episode really showed how much the characters had changed over the course of the series, especially Soo-Jung, which was enjoyable to see. Soo-Jung (Seung-Yeon Kong) was the sassy main character, and although she's a terrible person, in the first few episodes at least, you just can't help but love her, especially when you start to peel away her tough exterior. Sam-Yong is the small innocent character that just needs to be protected and he' so cute. OnDal seems cocky and sure of himself, but he's actually very lonely and needs support. Il-Yong, the antagonist, is ridiculously in love with himself and a bit of a wimp but he's still twisted and sadistic.The plot I thought was fairly original, as I personally haven't seen any time-travel K- Dramas myself. A few plot twists occurred throughout the series, although not all of them made sense and were not really explained. The best by far though was near the end when we discover the truth about the OnDal in the story and everything clicks into place! It also keeps you guessing which character will end up with who, and there is plenty of laughs and tears to be had along the way. The scene with the flowers and 'apologising in advance' is by far the cutest and will rip your heart out with feels. Because I'm a nerd and did some research about the original story about the princess and OnDal afterwards and I love that they kept so many details the same, for example, OnDal was known as 'the idiot' or 'the fool', so the show subtly referenced this by having Soo-Jung call him 'dumb OnDai' lots, which I thought was cool.Other things: I was surprised by the special effects as they were very inconsistent. One minute they were really great and looked amazing and the next I was crying with laughter at how shockingly bad they were. The music was average, it didn't particularly stand out for me. I really like the whole design of both costumes and setting, I don't know how accurate they were but they were very aesthetically pleasing, especially the natural locations such as the huge river with the rocks.Overall, My Only Love Song is a fun and dramatic K-Drama, the only real downside being a few plot inconsistencies. If you're a K-Drama fan it's definitely worth watching but if you're new to K-Drama then you might find it a bit weird and want something a little more normal to ease you in to the genre.", "\u2764Spoiler Alert\u2764Aaah...time travel, one of my favourite genres :) One of the best on-screen chemistry I have seen, which makes the love story between On Dal and Su-Jeong (aka Nannyeon) so immersing.

Thankfully, the love story was given justice with an equally beautiful ending and did not disappoint.

And everything that they encounter throughout the film magically comes together in the end, and it's truly heartwarming. You'll laugh, you'll cry, no matter who you are. I guarantee it. It couldn't be any better!", "*SPOILERS AHEAD*...taken from a reaction paper I wrote for Social Science Class..My Sassy Girl is a 2001 film by Korean director Kwak Jae Yong, formerly known for the straight melodramas he directed. It was based on the novel with the same title, compiled from the journals posted on the Internet by Kim Ho Seok about his relationship with a girl. The film catapulted its lead actress Jeon Ji Hyun and its lead actor Cha Tae Hyun into superstardom. It spawned viewers' interest in romantic comedies, although it was never recognized in the west.My Sassy Girl starts out with Gyeon-Woo, a na\u00efve but eccentric 25 year-old college student who doesn't have a clear direction in life. He narrates how his parents raised him like a girl, and how his parents' constantly telling him he was smart caused him to become lazy. His life then becomes intertwined with that of a bizarre girl whom he meets at the subway. She was drunk and wasted when he first saw her, and before passing out at the subway she calls him 'honey'. He was then forced to take responsibility for her, and that night he carried the wasted girl on her back all the way to a nearby motel. Hilarity ensues in the following scenes, as Gyeon-Woo and the girl share funny moments together, such as hitting each other on the subway, playing squash (the ball always hitting Gyeon-Woo squarely in the face), dancing in the disco with their high school uniforms on, and exchanging shoes (the girl wears sneakers while Gyeon-Woo wears heels).The early parts of the film showcase the girl's bizarre attitude. The girl can be seen arguing with strangers, writing synopses of action movies, passing out after drinking three glasses of beer, and hitting Gyeon-Woo all the time, telling him 'wanna die?' and using him to get her way. Gyeon-Woo, on the other hand, succumbs to all the girl's whims and does everything for her. The first half of the film is filled with pure physical comedy and witty, hilarious sequences.What sets this movie apart from others is how the second half of the film, which consists of pure melodrama, is connected to the first half. The second half explains the girl's bizarre attitude and unfolds all the drama behind the girl's comedic behavior in the first half. Gyeon-Woo battles a conflict with himself and finds it hard to let the girl go after 'healing her sorrow'. The latter scenes in the film are so dramatic that it 'turns grown men into crybabies' (quoted from the International Movie Database). Jeon Ji-Hyun's acting versatility added to the second half's strong impact on the viewers. A very ingeniously written script turns the laughing audience into a crying one in a short span of time.However sad the second half of the film may be, the 'overtime' part of the film wonderfully concludes all the comedy and drama that unfolded in the preceding two parts. Gyeon-woo and the girl go along with the sad fate that befell them, continuing their own lives. The ending (which I will not reveal, for I recommend that people watch it) could be considered as one of the greatest ones in the history of film-making. It left no questions unanswered, and it concluded all the subtle hints that the earlier parts gave. It left me, and other members of the audience, laughing in tears.The uncut version of the film lasts 137 minutes (2 hours and 17 minutes), quite long for a romantic comedy. But it was so craftily and carefully written that one would not notice time ticking by. Every scene in the film gives the viewers something to laugh, cry, or think about. There was no dead air in the story. The cinematography of the film was excellent, for it captured every scene perfectly, also showcasing the beautiful environment of Korea along the way. The soundtrack very much added to the emotion of the film's most significant sequences. George Winston's rendition of 'Pachelbel's Canon in D' invokes a very romantic and joyous feeling that is indeed felt in the scene where Gyeon-Woo gives the girl a rose during her class (at an all-girls school) while she was playing the piano. Shin Seung Hoon's 'I Believe', the movie's main theme, served its function well as the tear-inducer in the most dramatic parts of the film. After watching the movie, only hearing the song brings me to the edge of tears as I remember the saddest parts of the film.Jeon Ji-Hyun's acting in the film was very superior. She does very well in portraying the unnamed girl (yes, the girl's name was never mentioned) in the movie. Her very strong charm and acting versatility (she laughs, threatens Gyeon-Woo, and cries in one scene) makes the film very appealing, even to grown men who grew up watching action movies. Her performance in this film shoved her into the limelight and made girls want to be like her and made boys want to be with her.Cha Tae Hyun did justice to the role of Gyeon-Woo. Just looking at him makes you laugh, and his being punched, slapped and manipulated by the girl is one of the big factors in the film's success as a comedy. His performance in the film made him one of Korea's 'most wanted dates', according to a survey on Korean girls.Some of the very notable characteristics that I found in the film were: 1.) It had no kissing scenes; 2.) The girl's name was never mentioned, although she played the biggest part in the film, and 3.) There were no 'I love you' lines in the entirety of the film.After watching the uncut version of the film, I saw tears in the eyes of most people in the audience. I could most probably say the movie has been successful in moving its viewers.Jeon Ji Hyun won the 2002 Grand Bell Best Actress Award for her performance in this film. Cha Tae Hyun won Best New Actor at the 2002 Korean Oscars for his performance in this film. My Sassy Girl was number one at the box office for six straight weeks in Korea and sold over 20,000 tickets per day in Hong Kong at the time of its release in 2001. It was the second highest grosser of that year (accumulating more box office loot than SHREK, HARRY POTTER or LORD OF THE RINGS). It was the Best Asian Film at the 22nd Annual Hong Kong Film Awards. Just this year, Dreamworks (an American film company) has been planning for a Hollywood remake of this film. How great could this film get? My Sassy Girl is a film close to my heart. It is not only a lighthearted comedy that delves into the culture and behavior of Asian teenagers. This movie shows that there are so many different ways of expressing your love without saying 'I love you'. It is a movie that proves 'fate is building a bridge of chance for the one you love'.", "This is my \u0084afterword\" \u0096 maybe it's written more for myself, but please don't mind it and my lack in English too.When watching movies we rarely know what to wait from them and the least we wait the film to affect us so hard that suddenly a completely new dimension appears to us, that the movie will make us to look on things and life from a different viewpoint, will make you to remember forgotten things. But movies like that exist, and this is one of them .Thinking about this film I start to consider what the movie makers really want to achieve creating films and what is the task for a movie. Is it a picture movie with good cameraman's work, good acting , story or impressive special effects? These things are important ,but in my opinion, in a good movie the main is the message of it. I don't know if it is the director, the scriptwriter or the crew together who made this movie to touch the viewer, made him to look with a different look, who worked to make this film to deliver the message as it is, but I can say that they have achieved their aim.This movie is humane. It's message and characters are humane. It has no meaning if the end of the movie is happy or sad - there is joy and pain both in it, because that's exactly how the life is.I liked this movie. But it is impossible for me to rate it the same it's not possible for me to rate my own life.This movie touched me. I hope that many others too.", "-Minor Spoilers-This film is one of the greatest Romance/Comedy movies ever made, and as such, I feel I will have a hard time doing it justice with a few lines written here. The story was first seen online as an internet diary written by Korean student Ho Sik Kim. And is claimed to be based on a relationship with a girl he actually met. Yeah, that's right. It's a (mostly) true story! Then the story was bought by Korean film production company, Shin Cine. Finally, Korean director, Kwak Jae Yong, 'Sketch of a rainy day' was brought on board to direct. The rest, as they say. is history.The entire movie revolves around two main characters, 'Kyun Woo' (Cha Tae Hyun) and 'The Girl' (Yes, her name is never actually given) played by the wonderful Jeon Ji Hyun. The story begins when Kyun Woo meets the girl on a train platform late at night. See, she's drunk. Very drunk. After making a fool of herself on the train she passes out, but not before calling Kyun Woo \"Honey\". This leads the other passengers to believe that she is his girlfriend. In turn, our wimpy hero feels obliged to take care of her. So off he goes. Well, at least half way down the platform, before dropping her onto an empty bench. But do you think he has the heart to leave her there? Of course not. That's one of the things that makes this film special. Kyun Woo may be a bit soft. He may be even just a tad pathetic, but his heart is in the right place. All he wants to do is help the girl. But... What does he get in return? Well, He gets a down right scary, weird, psychopath of a girlfriend who takes every opportunity to either A: Hit him B: Humiliate him or C: Get him thrown into Jail. Yes, she's pretty mean. Or is she? Is there more to her than both Kyun Woo, and we the audience, can see? Maybe his wish to help her is not totally unjustified.One of the greatest achievements of this movie is in it's two leads. Considering nearly the entire movie focuses on just two people. The stars did a very good job of keeping up 'very' good chemistry. These are two wonderful actors who portray all the emotions needed, and at a very high level. Cha Tae Hyun, in his first role manages to keep Kyun Woo on just the right side of Bumbling, Shy and even Pathetic. At no point in the movie does he annoy, and that's a hard task indeed. He's always laughable. Granted, sometimes you laugh with him, mostly we laugh 'At him,' but that never stops you from thinking you'd like to have him as your friend. Jeon Ji Hyun however, is just incredible. She is the best actress of her generation. I don't just mean in Korea. I mean PERIOD. She fills the character of 'the girl' with depth, charm and overall a sense of reality which in a film that occasionally becomes far fetched is an excellent achievement indeed. She is incredibly expressive. Most of the time she doesn't even need to say anything. Her face says all we need to know. Some of her expressions are just priceless, and I can honestly say I have never, ever seen them captured on film before. i'd be 'more' than a little surprised if she doesn't become more of an 'international' star in the next few yearsThe film features a wide range of genre's. Although It is primarily a Romance/Comedy film, it also has a dash of action courtesy of the girl's 'Scriptwriting' hobby. This leads to all manor of imagined scenarios staring Jeon Ji Hyun. Be it parodies of 'The Matrix' in her 'Demolition Terminator' story, to an 'Ashes Of Time' style period/swordplay movie later on in the film. These scenes, while not exactly furthering the plot are really well done, and a nice little break from the main story.My favourite aspect of the film is how the director gives little hints and tips as to what is happening in the story without actually telling us. Each and every small detail (Which at first may seem trivial or pointless) will come back to play a major part in the film later on. Apart from being a really neat little way to tell the story, it also makes the film nearly infinitely re-watchable. You can come back to it again and again and you'll always notice something new which enhances the plot. By the time you get to the midpoint of this film you 'will' care for these characters. As it approaches a more touching, less comedic, romance angle you wont lose interest. It's clever, funny, touching and romantic.The only people who may not like this will be those allergic to romantic films. Even then, I feel you may just be surprised. I cannot recommend this film enough. If you don't watch it. You only have yourself to blame.", "My sassy girl is a movie kind of old indeed, I have it since it went out on DVD, because every movie I hear good comments I buy it, but honestly I didn't see this movie until yesterday, I saw the directors cut which is 15 minutes longer, so the movies reaches 2 hour 15 minutes, and there wasn't a single minute that I got bore, the movie is the perfect mix of comedy and romance, the comedy part doesn't seems to happen because of forced situations, they are more like things that could happen to your or me. The movie is son engaging that I saw it yesterday and I cant stop thinking about it, honestly I'll see it tomorrow again with some friends, because people usually do not like to watch foreign movies thinking that only Hollywood makes good movies (and that is such a mistake).The actors are cool, honestly in the beginning of the movie I tough common these 2 are the stars? but then you realize they are perfect, casue they seems to be 2 normal everyday people, not HOT STARS with perfects bodys (I ended loving that girl), the chemistry is perfect, the two of them blends together so nice that I could believe that everything that happens on the screen is real.The Score, WOW, I already had to buy it, the music was like I was playing some Final Fantasy game, That means that every music you hear fits perfectly to the scene.My only concern is the remake Dreamworks is doing, that scare me, doing a movie again just cause Americans don't like to watch movies with Asian people? bad very bad, I feel sorrow for them, I am glad I don't have that problem and I can watch this movie the way it was envisioned.One advice: WATCH IT NOW!!!10/10", "This movie shot right to the top of my favorites of all time, at first I where a little uncertain about if I would enjoy a Korean movie, but it put all my expectations to shame and I where captivated through the entire movie. The next day I had to call my close friend and get her over to watch it too.I've since seen it numerous time, both alone and with friends and I have yet to find a person who did not enjoy it as much as me. I only wish I could have never seen it and experience watching it for the first time again.I really can't recommend this movie highly enough and in my opinion it truly belongs on the IMDb top 250 list.", "This is one of those movies that makes you think about it for hours after you have seen it(whether the first or the fifth time). The reason being that it is funny, witty and enthralling while still maintaining the charisma of a great Korean romantic movie.You will undoubtedly hate Ji-Hyun Jun for the better half of the film but by the end, she will be one of the most enchanting woman you ever saw (Besides Audrey Hepburn off-course). Tae-Hyun Cha plays the role of a difident sort nice guy but with good acting and sound expressions.Overall, I would give this a 10/10. Don't forget to read the book though, its a lot funnier and accurate.Thank you", "I can say nothing short of a classic about this movie. My friend recommended this movie who said it was pretty cute. I never really saw a Korean movie but I was interested. I was hooked form the start with the unique style of story telling. I have to admit it that I hate the voices especially the girl. But after half an hour I just forgot it and just sank into this wonderful story.The first half is full of funny scenes(especially the abortion lie).I would just hate the girl for giving the poor, sensitive hero a hard time. Throughout there are subtle hints about her complex character. Both the actors have done exceptionally well but the main attraction is the plot.The soldier in the park scene was a little unnecessary,although I think it helps unravel the girl's strange character. From the second half onwards I start to understand more about the girl and by the end I just loved her amazing spirit. The story unfolds the reasons for her bossy behaviour. At the same time the relationship between them matures. The train scene with the line on the floor was really funny. Towards the end the scenes moves towards pure melodrama - and its been done really nice. The hill top scene was heartbreaking and the \"ten rules\" was beautiful. I liked the train scene which was funny and moving at the same time. The overtime ties back any broken threads in the story and the sad story of her life is finally revealed.The ending, in my opinion was one of the best ever, which makes you go over the whole movie in your head at that instant. A few pointers of the style of \"Serendipity\". The Hero is funny and nicely portrays the innocent and kind hearted Gweon-Woo. The beautiful Ji-hyun Jun as the bossy I-am-so-special girl is a nice choice.The main thing I like is that it is not an American romance type movie. I don't really like the American type romance which is focused around sex and complex issues.(Though \"Titanic\" and \"You have got mail\" are my favourites). The background score was also top notch. Especially \"I believe\". The only criticism that can be made is that some of the jokes were vulgar. Otherwise it would be a great family movie. I feel kind of embarrassed watching this in front of my family.A few things which was peculiar about this movie were 1. The girl's name is never mentioned 2. They never kiss On the whole I cannot rate it below 10 by any means. A must-see for any one who loves Romantic movies and every one else TOO!!", "The attention to detail, the depth and width of the plot is amazing.  The movie is so good that it provide good entertainment to many audience.I cannot grasp all of it till I saw it the second time.  There are several plots in the movie.  I am learning more about the movie when I am writing this.It's NOT only a love story of how 2 people with contrasting personality fall in love; it may give that impression to some people.  It's NOT a normal dumb boy chase beautiful girl flick.STOP READING and see the movie again if you really think this movie is just a romantic flick with funny jokes.  You will enjoy it more.SUPER SPOILER ---------------------The Character: The girl always think she is special (she say that explicitly when she is crying at the hillside), and which beautiful girl doesn't? Or at least everyone else wish to?   She is very self-centered, proud, witty (remember how quick she get Gyun-Woo out of class?), talented (kendo, piano, squash, dance), not afraid of how people look at her, live in a quite well off family etc.The director has to stress that Gyun-Woo is smart (from their parents) because viewer may not really notice that if they don't really observe.  He is a sensitive person, probably due to his girlish upbringing.Gyun-Woo is quite layback, and yet to determine what he desire or want in life in the beginning.  And that's one of the reason the girl said, 'I have met the boy from the future' at the ending.  For the first 3 years they meet, they are not really ready for each other, due her ex-boyfriend (exbf) and personality.  They are at the crossroad, so they eventually have to split.The Story: In the subway, Gyun-Woo gets the girl's attention immediately since he looks like her ex-boyfriend.  She may actually intentionally grasp his attention by vomiting etc.  Then she announces to the public right away that he is her 'Sweet heart', so he have no option but to take care of her.  As a proof of Gyun-Woo getting her attention is that, she scold at the youngster who wears pink.  She thinks he is special and no one else should wear the same color for the one she thinks special.  This point can verified again in the park which the guy who smokes and wear the same blue-colored sweater. She knows she is beautiful and clothing matter a lot for her or those she cares.It is quite deceiving that most viewer will initially think that only Gyun-Woo is attracted by the girl and a normal boy chase girl story starts. But it's not.  They both are attracted to each other at their first sight.To call Gyun-Woo 'sweet heart' may come from her subconscious.  It is so important to her to understand herself that she need to confirm with Gyun-Woo that she indeed think Gyun-Woo has so much resemblance with her exbf.  So she phoned Gyun-Woo to come out for the 1st time.  (Phone number probably obtained during their stay at the police station)After Gyun-Woo left the girl on a bench, he forget the girl's handbag and he have to return it a few steps later.   Later, he forget her handbag again in the rain. This time leads him to visit the girl's home for the first time. We can see that every detail is well layout, intentional in this movie.First time I see the movie, I was distracted by my laughing, but now I know the reason why police rush up to the motel.  The phone call is made by the girl's parent.  That's one of the reasons why her parents' are not approved of him.  And they know it's all lie when he try explaining why the motel's lighter is in his pocket.(Is there any meaning for the kids to all suddenly gone when they are in the coffees shop?  And why does the coffee come so late?) (Why does the girl slap Gyun-Woo so often? Is there any meaning behind?)The Girl always tries to be different.  She doesn't like people dress alike; she doesn't like those people ordering the same golbangee (beef stew) in the restaurant.Why are they using the same motel room the second night? On the first night the innkeeper says there no room left from 1st to 3rd floor, so on the second night the same thing happened coincidentally; all other rooms are occupied.Do your recognize in her first script Gyun-Woo asks why don't they kiss at the end?  He is actually talking about why they do not kiss in this movie. Then the girl (director) says that this script (movie) is not a melodrama. (Then, how come this movie is a action movie?)Also, the first script prophesize the girl saving Gyun-Woo in the playground later.For the second script, I will talk about that later.The reason why she pushes Gyun-Woo into the water is she wants Gyun-Woo in the water too. She wants Gyun-Woo in some way connected to her exbf too. Her exbf drowned, implied when the girl staring at a pier with the ex-bf's mother later.  Assuming that she don't know whether Gyun-Woo can swim or not, the girl is confident that she can rescue him OR she hope this boy will not just leave her, by a simple drowning accident.  The story did not tell how her ex-bf drowned, whether the girl is present or not.  But if the girl was at the scene at the accident, that means she have learnt lifegaurding after he died (which I biasedly assume).  Nevertheless, the girl found peace of mind/satisfaction that she knows if she is together with any boy, the boy will not be drowned.  She wants to try and confirm that with this boy.In the playground's 'Ghost House', the girl say the pain one suffered from being dumped will be gone quicker than one can imagine.  But it looks like it is contrary to her own behavior.  So, why she said that?  Actually the girl is not just grieving for the death of her exbf at this stage. She is also guilty, angry with herself on not loving her ex-bf as much any more. Or at least, she is struggling with try keep loving him or kicks him out of her mind/present life.  Rationally, she knows this is the thing to do, to face it, to leave away from the ghost of his exbf.  However, she is not as 'special' as she would like, that she still long for him, since she is attracted to Gyun-Woo the first time they met.The soldier claimed the guardhouse sergeant looks like Gyun-Woo.  Who else look like Gyun-Woo?  He should be the ex-bf.  The director maybe even hinting that he is not that good to the Girl, although the girl never know this.  Well, I may be stretching that a bit here, but considered so many detail in this movie have an explanation, I won't be surprised if this is what the director meant.When the girl is saving Gyun-Woo under gunpoint, she cried.  She is actually talking to herself this time.  She think that her dead ex-bf want her to live well.  She says if she needs to learn what love is, she need to live well.  To live well, love is essential, but this is what a dead man cannot give her.  This is her struggle.At the end of the playground scene Gyun-Woo say what had happened is as if what he have planned.  He intends to understand the girl better at her birthday. At this stage all he know is the girl is devastated from a breakup, but not much else. Under such a stressful circumstances, the answer she give on how she view about her pain, view of good life/love must be authentic.  It's something hard to achieve by a normal date on this girl. Although the means is not what he expected, the ends is.    And the last slap on his face is always good.  It means she cares.Part 2 *****Gyun-Woo noticed somehow notice the girl in the restaurant.  Then Gyun-Woo goes back alone and asks around about this picture because Gyun-Woo will not ask that when the girl is around. Gyun-Woo want to understand her pain, try solving it.  The girl bring Gyun-Woo there a lot.  By now, Gyun-Woo is really a replacement for his exbf, and he knows. He tries to be nice and smile.  And Gyun-Woo said that she pretends to be happy every time (in this restaurant), because he knows she has lots of memory/history with her exbf in this restaurant.  And she comes back with him often.Not too sure why the bad guy in the 3rd script is called Gyun-Woo, and why she have to kill him?  If the director really meant the bad guy = her exbf (because they are look-alike and the director don't want to give a name to her exbf), it means the girl try forget him.  And interestingly the girl comes from future, so the director may think she can only forget him some time in future?After the script, she says 'Someday, I'll meet someone from the future'. Actually, it means 'Today, she meet someone (important to her= Gyun-Woo) that will be suitable for her in the future'.   Then Gyun-Woo says, 'if you do, ask him to take you; if it's possible!'  Gyun-Woo is urging her to let himself to take her!   Gyun-Woo looks very serious at this moment.  This is not a joke of 'You, sassy girl, let someone come from a UFO/future kidnap you!'After the 3rd script, they always ride subway together, play squash, phone each other every night, and wait for Gyun-Woo at school etc.  The girl really starts to love him, ever since Gyun-Woo chase her on high heel.  The longer he runs, the longer she loves him.  She remains jubilant that night. Even in the rain,  she is even nice enough to him, to run back home for an umbrella.  Each day, she likes Gyun-Woo more and more.Their parent controls her too much. (Party) because she love them too, she refrain herself from seeing Gyun-Woo/have to dealt directly with her parents about this.  So, Gyun-Woo doesn't have any news from her for a long time until their 100th day when their parent give her pressure.In the taxi, Gyun-Woo wonders if she still needs him as her exbf's replacement.  He tries to heal her pain, but he thinks the irony is that once the pain is gone, she no longer needs him.  He is well aware that the 'action'/'power' is always initiated from her.  But just for this moment, it does not matter; he enjoys every moment with her.  He ask the taxi driver to let them stay together longer.Maybe what Gyun-Woo think is correct, she doesn't need him anymore. That's why once her parent again pressured her this time; they don't meet each other for such a long time that Gyun-Woo think they are over.  So it's not too surprising for Gyun-Woo to go to a blind date.The condom and blind date joke is really funny, though gross.This time, the girl has a blind date.  She definitely is not the one who arrange it, her controlling parents do.  She call Gyun-Woo for help, Gyun-Woo is her 'friend'.  She has to call and give Gyun-Woo a chance here, since this time her blind date is quite nice.Ah... the 10 rules are very moving.  Gyun-Woo must be very sad when he left the restaurant.  He gives up on her.  He is giving his final blessing to them.The girl finally realizes that she did not recognize how deep he loves her. He deserve much more than a replacement or 'friend'. Everything she did want Gyun-Woo do for her is simply the way she try to find her exbf in Gyun-Woo. Gyun-Woo is not necessary Gyun-Woo in her mind at those important moments. She thought she just enjoy reliving it.  But after the 10 rules, she can no longer deny Gyun-Woo is the one who makes her happy, not the ghosts of her exbf.Before they try kissing, Gyun-Woo said they are on a crossroad since she had always regarded Gyun-Woo as painkiller.  But now she knows that she feel guilty for him and it's time for her to take action, to accept Gyun-Woo as 'another' important person in her life.  Gyun-Woo has already done all he can at this stage.But for the Girl to look at Gyun-Woo is painful.  He reminds her of his ex-bf, every time.  They look and seem to act alike.  She has to completely remove her ex-bf (first love, I believe)'s image before she can really love Gyun-Woo.  But she feels guilty to try removing her exbf from her mind, at the same time.When Gyun-Woo is writing the letter, saying he want to be serious with her. But even though he doesn't know exactly what she's thinking, he is sensitive enough to think this letter is for their split up.At the mountain, she express that her ex-bf is still very well within her. She hopes she is different, she hope she have the will to overcome, but no, she is still helpless.  She cannot avoid thinking of her ex-bf when seeing Gyun-Woo.  She is sorry, for that.They have to split; Gyun-Woo's presence is too disturbing for her to forget. She gives herself 2 years.  She goes away for Gyun-Woo.  Gyun-Woo tries to grow up and his life in these 2 years just devoted to her; he even tried and succeeds fulfilling her dream. No more blind dates, he is committed.The way they pile up the stones (and how Gyun-Woo remove it), one-by-one instead of bushing them away is quite a display sensitivenessOvertime ***** It's quite too late to explain clearly the drowning of her exbf now.  It makes lots of audience miss why her grievance is so deep.  And may not understand some finer points of the movie.Now we know why the girl ask about the handkerchief when Gyun-Woo is with the girl was crying at the 2nd restaurant.  A handkerchief has a very special meaning for her.  This was how her exbf meet her.She says 'While I was dating you, I met his mother OFTEN, she wanted to introduce a nice men to me, BUT I couldn't' Simply means she is still love her exbf very much at that time.  Also, it's quite funny that she thinks her exbf wants to introduce Gyun-Woo to her, when Gyun-Woo is hanging out with her.She wants to put this letter into a time capsule because it is too cruel so tell Gyun-Woo all this right away.  And she does believe she will overcome her mental barrier in 2 year.  However she cannot. It takes her 3 years.What the old man says to her is important; he makes her know that Gyun-Woo is still very much in love with her.  Time means nothing to him, just for her (NB. This is what the theme song about)The girl called Gyun-Woo's phone but the number has been changed.  She cried. Wondered if they ever met again, when she is ready for him now, after 3 years.  Not too sure if they'd ever meet by chance again.  Then she smiled.  But why she smiles?  Maybe she has just remembered how Gyun-Woo pretended the voice message long time ago?  Or have her just lost hope and grin bitterly?  The tiny touches let audience imagines, and could as well be the ending at this point.Can they meet by chance?  Very often fate only give you 1 chance.  Once you lose it, you lose it.  Gyun-Woo must be very upset when he misses her this time in the subway.Maybe due to coincidence, they finally met each other at her exbf's mom's lunch.Then she said, 'I think I met a man from the future, from your (Gyun-Woo)'s future.'  Do you recall all 1st and 3d script tells a story of girl coming from future helps Gyun-Woo or everyone else?  But this time, she meant instead of the girl coming from future, it is the boy coming from future that saves her.The best part of the movie is that it can be viewed from many angles.  Many subplots.. ---------------------------------------The Platform plot: ------------------ After the 10 rules, Gyun-Woo stands on the verge of subway platform (as seen on the surveillance camera). Is he trying to feel her pain of the breakup that she experienced with her exbf when she stood there? Was she really trying to kill herself at that time?  He wants to understand this feeling. Or simply just want to remember how they first met.  Then, He must be really happily running when he hear her voice form the broadcast.At the end of movie, when she stands on the platform edge again, we only saw her feet.  But what's really on her mind?  Is she expecting Gyun-Woo will pull her back again this time?  Now they have lost contact, will coincidence let them meet again?  Or is she simply enjoying the thought of how they first meet?  Nevertheless the subway come, she has to reluctantly drag her feet back, behind the yellow line.The edge of the platform is a crossroad of their fate.  This is the place she is going to suicide, where they met, where they miss each other, where travel together and getting to like each other etc.The Science Fiction Plot: ------------------ At the girl's third script, she mentioned explicitly the science fiction Plot of this movie, UFO = time machine.  Then she prophesize Gyun-Woo will like to travel back in time, the old-aged Gyun-Woo.  She said 'people from the future could be here now'Why don't they travel together?  Did the girl left Gyun-Woo/died before the invention of time machine?  Well, this is a story not being told. However, it is hinted that it's quite likely that the girl go back and make fun of him with the toad in the time capsule.  How about the head hitting squash? Another naughty joke from future?In her letter in the time capsule, she feels that Gyun-Woo 'live in the future' and she 'live in the past'From the look of the old man under the tree, do you think he is expecting her to visit the tree?  Don't you think it's quite rude for him to stare at her?  Yet the old man's answer is honest enough, because she is beautiful. The old man always says that because he is the old Gyun-Woo.  And of course he read the letters.What is his secret of the tree? Gyun-Woo cannot really replace a tree.  But with the help of the old Gyun-Woo, he can. This is a secret because the old Gyun-Woo only wants to share this between him and her! No one else! He say 'Fate is building a bridge of chance for someone you love' because he is help building this bridge for themselves.When she lookup after reading Gyun-Woo's letter, a UFO passes by; even with sound effect.The old Gyun-Woo was there inside the train when they met.At the end, she said 'I think I met a man from the future, from your (Gyun-Woo)'s future'.  This is literally what has happened.The Girl's second script ------------------ For the 2nd time I see this movie, I cannot fully grasp this script.  But now I can. Actually the girl is committing suicide when they first met.  She know she get drunk easily, it easier to do it that way.  She wants to die at the 1st year anniversary of her exbf's death.  This is why in her 2nd script the 'unlucky' boy should be buried alive, which simply meant lovers should better die together.  Do you think that the girl looks more like a ghost than a drunken woman at the platform?  It's quite a drastic look for lead actress in movie that supposed to be a comedy (at least at the beginning). The vomit after that is very good. It makes the audience forget her awful look, or forget to wonder if she is commiting suicide.  But isn't that quite crazy for anyone to vomit onto someone.  We all know that she is drunk but is still quite aware of her action.  But naturally, she doesn't really care since she planned to kill herself anyway!  The girl is not as sassy as most people perceived.  But she's pretty unruly anyway.When dating with Gyun-Woo, she always has to struggle with her guilt to her exbf, since her exbf have done nothing wrong to her.  He have no choice, he have to leave her.  For her, to accept a person that is in many ways resembles her exbf as another individual, is a especially difficult task. Her life can be much easier if she choose that nice guy at her blind date (or any other guy); but she knows Gyun Woo is her right choice however difficult this choice is.The Theme of the story is: Fate vs. Coincidence ------------------ Tons of coincidence happened here: Gyun-Woo is a look-alike, know the exbf's mother, is that coincidence? How coincidence is that the one girl you pick randomly on the street is the Girl? The birthday of the Girl and the soldier is the same; Blind date at the same night; the handkerchief, which is the first favor of both her ex-bf and Gyun-Woo give, is greenish; they both first met in subway; they have meet all of the 5 twins, without them recognizing....At the end of movie, Gyun-Woo asked, 'Is that coincidence?'  This is the question the director is asking the audience what is fate and what is pure coincidence.  Director's view of Fate is it happens only when one build/desire of it.  He demonstrate that by putting lots of coincidence in the movie, while let both characters work hard for/build up their good ending, which many people will regard that as fate.\nExamples of building chances: The old Gyun-Woo is help building his own fate under the tree by voicing the young Gyun-Woo's effort.  And during the 3 years separation they are building a bridge for each other on their own, by making themselves available for each other.  If the girl still cannot get out of her exbf's entangle, there is no point of meeting again.  And now Gyn-Woo seems to find a direction of his life on writing script.Lastly, have her exbf also bridge a bridge for the one he loved?  Gyun-Woo and the girl met on the 1st year of his death anivesary.  And the girl actually thinks her exbf want to introduce Gyun-Woo to her.  Maybe a supernatural plot is included here too! ;) Have her exbf arranged their final meeting by his mom etc?  Even Gyun-Woo does not considered himself look like his cousin (but the girl, her ex-bf, his mom does)By the director's definition, it is their fate to be together eventually.", "'Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo' (a.k.a. 'My Sassy Girl') is one of the most unconventional love stories I have witnessed in recent cinema. The storytelling is of the most sincere. There's no pretension. The comedy, drama and romance are very well balanced. There is no sex, not even a kiss, no one says 'I love you' and yet it turns out to be one of the most 'romantic' cinematic experience.'Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo' moves at a smooth pace. Jae-young Kwak's screenplay and direction are fantastic. The dialogues are smart and the characters are richly developed and unique. The female protagonist's character remains enigmatic right until the end. Her name isn't even mentioned during the entire film. We see everything from Gyun-woo's point of view and Jae-young Kwak gives detailed insight of the characters and their relationships. There are so many beautiful moments in the film but I won't give out any spoilers. In addition, with the use of a lovely gentle soundtrack and cinematography, he beautifully demonstrates the wonderful locations. Even though I loved the way the Korean culture was portrayed, the story is pretty universal.Newcomer Tae-hyun Cha leads the entire film. His performance is completely natural that it doesn't even feel that he was acting, let alone the fact that he was only new to films. His expressions, spontaneity, reactions and chemistry with co-stars are spot on. He is superb with the comedy and subtle in the dramatic scenes. Gianna Jun holds her own and does a fine job.Overall, 'Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo' is a very well crafted film. It's a heartwarming poetic romantic adventure from start to finish. I know this sounds a bit corny but I'll say that it's a film that's close to my heart.", "I heard that there will be a remake of My Sassy Girl, so as my subject say, GO WATCH IT NOW! This movie is so beautiful! The actors are brilliantly acted very well. The story is just plain, simple, it is my all time favorite movie! My sassy Girl is almost a perfect film, so I have no question why everyone who watched it, they liked it. My sassy girl is a classic, no not even it's co-Asian countries will remake or retain the power of this movie. This film is what you called \"Exclusively for Koreans\" so Hollywood, live this movie alone OK! But still, WATCH IT NOW! BEFORE Hollywood POISON THIS FILM!10/10", "Three years ago I was at a friends place, we couldn't figure out what to do so she \"forced\" me to watch \"My sassy girl\". From the look of the DVD cover I knew this was something I would not enjoy, the picture projected a film made of teen pop Hollywood garbage.I reluctantly agreed to watch it for a while but I became interested after about 15 minutes. The first half I thought was pretty good, until I realized there was still a second half to this. The second half seemed to drag on and I was praying for it to end. The overtime made me frustrated because I thought this was becoming less of a movie and more of a TV series (in terms of length). And than it was over and I realized what an amazing film this was.To keep this short I will tell you that I have directly \"forced\" about one hundred people to watch this film. The largest group I forced to watch \"My sassy girl\" occurred during two canceled lectures, students were sitting there bored so I popped this in. The class was made up of different social/racial/gender/whatever cross sections. Everyone watched the first half and they showed up and stayed for the final half the following week, some people even came up to tell me how much they liked it. Only 2 people have given bad responses, one person because he did not finish watching it and the other because she doesn't like watching a film with subtitles.From the rating for this movie it is clear that there are people who hate this film, but if you belong to the other 85% of the population than you will love it.Why did I like this movie? It was a \"mystery\" movie with clues throughout. They made an entire movie with (basically) two characters. There was no pointless tacked on sex, not even a kiss.Watch the Directors Cut if you can. The movie was actually more enjoyable the second time around. 10/10", "I saw this movie with my girlfriend. I don't think we stopped laughing at it for a bit. I think this is one of the funniest movies ever. Everything from it made me feel happy. This has about the most well defined characters you'll ever see on film that are true to how they really are. I enjoyed this film so much. The girl was really cute, and she was mean and she was sweet. The guy wanted a girl and all he ever really found was this girl who was actually a guy. Then the movie got really sad. I couldn't believe why the girl was so sad, but that part made me cry. It ended up being a quest on trying to find out what true love is. Letting go is a really hard thing, but letting go of something else you've found when you find out how dear that really is to you can mean the entire world in the end. I love this movie... :)", "Saw this movie with absolutely zero expectations...was almost asleep and watched it at a friend's place to pass the time. To my surprise, while it is not the best movie, it is definitely one of my favorites of the year and one of my favorite comedies of all time. I hope I get a chance to see it again because apparently there are a lot of little subtle things in it that you don't see the first or maybe even the second time around.\nI think some people get too caught up in the fact that the movie lacks realism, but I think that's what makes it all the wackier and funnier. I usually have a very low regard for Asian comedies, but this one was certainly worth watching. Absolutely hilarious but maintaining a touching side to it. The characters and situations are so interesting and absorbing that you tend to forget that you are being manipulated by all the sappiness.", "I haven't seen such movie st&#305;ry is excellent director put up a great job and both lead actor and actress is perfect.This movie is a theatrical feast.The actor played his role like he is playing his life actress (really pretty girl) played like she was born to act this role.The story?Its perfect its the first time have seen lots of people laughing and crying at the same time.You may think these things cannot happen then watch it and experience a new kind of feeling. After i watch this movie i reconciled with my ex-girlfriend.This movie left great effect on me and many people i know i think you should have this movie on DVD and keep it, watch it whenever you feel like divorcing or breaking up.", "Well, I'm not as sassy as The Girl. Thus, i provide some reasons for it! Here are the reasons why you should watch \"My Sassy Girl\"!!!:-it's funny! (the acting, the facial expression,the plot and specially all of my favorite train (barf & bet), motel, theme park, story telling and their parents scenes!)-it's naughty! (the acting by Cha Tae-hyun and part of the editing are TRICKY with a twist of SCI-FI!)-it's beautiful! (the film score, the cinematography, the scenic views and Jun Ji-hyun, of course!)-it's innocent! (the acting and the love between Cha Tae-hyun and Jun Ji-hyun and the beauty of Jun Ji-hyun)-it's crazy! (the series of unexpected events happen in the movie)-it's wacky! (the character which is played by Jun Ji-hyun)-it's natural! (the acting by the cast and the beauty, the compositing, the smile and the tears of Jun Ji-hyun)-it's sweet! (the love, the smile and the interaction between Cha Tae-hyun and Jun Ji-hyun)-it's romantic! (my favorite piano playing Canon in D major scene! this is not your so-called average love story and it's romantic in an unexpected way!)-it's touching! (the score, the movie, mountain, balcony, 10 date rules scenes and the ending that i always weep over for several times!)-it's refreshing! (neither a typical nor ordinary romantic love flick!)-it's superb! it's excellent! it's tremendous! it's fascinating! it's captivating! It's perfect! (the MOVIE, the CAST, the ACTING, the DIRECTOR, the CREW, Jun Ji-hyun, Cha Tae-hyun, their EFFORT, the SCREENPLAY, the MUSIC, the CINEMATOGRAPHY, the ONE-TAKE balcony scene and everything!)-it's SASSY! (explanation is unnecessary because it's SASSY!)-it's LOVE! (well, watch it for yourself!)-it's a CLASSIC! (no doubt due to its uniqueness and originality)-it's a MUST WATCH! (don't ask me why!)-it's my ALL TIME FAVORITE! (i just simply couldn't resist romance movie with a twist of comedy and SCI-FI! Too many favorite scenes inside the movie for me! It's absolutely my pot of Jjigae(Korean steamboat)!) Yum yum!And here is my final advice - Just watch it and stop reading my review if you are a real movie lover! It's absolutely worth to be watched at least 3 times in lifetime. One alone, one with your beloved one and another one to enjoy seeking the hidden details which are nicely set-up by the director! OK, just watch it! Would you?You won't be regret! But if you are regret after watching it, sorry for my terrible obsession with this movie or probably infatuation with Jun Ji-hyun!\"I met a man from the future.\" & \"Fate is building a bridge of chance for someone you love.\" are my favorite quotation from the movie!Strongly and highly recommended! Too bad i can't rate it more than 10 out of 10! (Personally, i don't fancy Hollywood to be able to bring out the feeling and the message by remaking it!)", "Although there were a couple of scenes that didn't quite translate for me, the movie overall was a great romantic comedy. The first two or three encounters, especially, were ripe for laughs. This is a good date movie and one that just about any audience can get into.The repeated chance encounters add something to the standard romantic comedy formula, as does the protagonist's continued willingness to take the girl's abuse. You get the feeling he doesn't quite know why he's taking it, and he doesn't particularly like it, but can't help himself. That's probably as good an analogy of romantic love as any.I'd say this movie is as appealing to women as it is to men; after we watched it my girlfriend knocked me down and kicked me a few times.", "I watched this film by mistake - I simply didn't ender the right saloon, but I don't sorry for that at all. Why you should watch it? it surely is different from the other films that you've watched lately the actors are young and they love playing, not like the spoiled Hollywood \"wunderkinds\"it's funnyit's realistic /with real emotions and problems of the young people - no matter whether they are in Asia, Europe, or America/at least for this short time, you can feel something of the culture. I am sure, that you won't find the time for watching the movie lost and won't regret it, like I didn't.", "This Korean film was unbelievablely popular last year in China, but I didn't see it at that time, because I sort of unconsciously have a dislike to something that nearly everybody else is crazy over.But everybody I knew recommended this film. So I finally decided to see it, this morning, and it won me instantly. I am not a keen fan for romantic comedies, though I do enjoy films like Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail, etc. This film should fall in the same category. The lead roles are brilliant. The girl of the film, you might not like her at start, but as the film goes along she just turns more and more beautiful as you get to know her and her past. The boy, on the other hand, is likeable from the word go (not the handsome type, but quite funny). The comedy is enjoyable and provides some good laughs, but as the film develops into the second hour it just turns so romantic. Of course everybody knows the boy and girl will get together in the end, but the process is really \"tormenting\". This might not be a great film, but it's truly romantic and great fun to watch. 8 out of 10.", "In all the Asian comedies i've seenand i have seen a lot this is by far my favorite The way \"the girl\" acted could sound like shes a complete bitch, but she remains likable during the whole movie. when she bosses kyun around it's hilarious,because you could see that happening.this movie isn't really like American chick flicks, the 2 characters aren't all over each other,and there isn't a major \"break up\" thing in the middle like some American movies were the couple breaks up and the guy or girl goes beyond measure to get each other back not saying thats bad but its nice to see something different.instead of that the character take a long mutual agreed time apart, and each try to improve themselves for when they finally get back together.and the story about the time machine old guy is creative and makes you wonder if he is from the future. this was based on the blog writings of Kim Ho-sik a korean man, who wrote this of the way he and his girlfriend meet.the ending was very creative and cute.all in all i give it a 11 if possible", "Highly recommended with a warning: do not expect a Hollywood recipe? Brief review: Very funny, yet deep down very romantic. However, the main character -the Sassy Girl- is so scared of falling in love, again, that she never lets any cheesy romantic moment between her and her boyfriend/good friend, also for you.. so guys, come on, sit down and watch and enjoy it. A small reminder, it is a Korean movie and I watched it with English subtitles.The story is about a guy in Korea, who is forced to visit her aunt whom he does not like to visit much and ends up meeting a drunk girl in the subway, whom he carries to a motel room, because she is drunk as a skunk and vomits everywhere. well, he tries to look the other way but feels sorry for her. however, as it is often said, no good deed goes unpunished and he finds himself even in jail because of her, and quite often if i may add. but then again, when she is not drunk, she is a funny and though-looking girl with so much sorrow inside that he can not help bearing whatever she brings to his life.Towards the end of the movie, the characters and their past and future are explored in more details without loosing anything from the funny style. Both lead actor and the actress are good but I think the guy is a little bit better. I loved his reactions, especially during squash games. Not to mention the times he was beaten by his mom (well, eastern society rules, I guess :) ) What about the midnight visit to the fair ground part? Funny..Very nice, very funny, very emotional movie. I think this may be a great Valentine Day movie..Definitely makes you think about destiny, if there is one. I like the definition of destiny in this movie, too.", "I've had this movie for a while but the title's always pulled me back from watching it..and yesterday I finally did out of pure boredom. And after watching it I gotta say that My Sassy Girl is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's an emotional and funny film. And everything that happens in the movie is just so well structured. I don't see why anyone shouldn't give this movie a go even if it is Korean... you will be inspired by it. It'll take you on an emotional roller-coaster which will make you laugh... and cry. This story of Ho-sik Kim is a beauty and he has managed to put it into film and I'm pretty sure that at some point in the movie you will be moved by it because it relates to someone you know, or yourself so well..well at least that's it in my case ;)", "hi..well i understand the point of koreans that this kind of relationship in my sassy girl is not common to their culture..yes that's the point, what makes this movie a hit because it shows a different kind of relationship that really inspired a lot of viewers all over the world specially here in the Philippines..because if i'm not mistaken their culture is more closer to us..now all i can say is that I was very touched by this movie, I have now a positive point of view towards love on how to make everything special...I really love jeon ji hyun because she used to be had a different attitude and personality..try also to watch her 2004 movie entitled \"WINDSTRUCK\" and you know what i really want to say..you will really love her..but for me windstruck is just second to my sassy girl", "I don't know how many times i have watched the movie, because i like the story very much. Its like the story of my classmate and I in my university (because she never become my girlfriend thats why she's just my friend). They have the same traits with the girl in the movie. Thats why I called her sassy girl. First I never expected to like the movie. but when I saw it I cannot help myself to watch it everyday. I bought a copy for myself for me to review the movie everyday... I cried when Gyun Woo gave her blind date 10 rules and the theme song starts to play. This is one of the part that I like most. second was when she played the piano and Gyun Woo gave her a rose. I like the piano piece very much..So watch the movie and see for yourself the hilarious comedy in korean movie history.", "This movie is proof that making love stories does not have to include raunchy sex scenes and nudity (take notes Hollywood!). This is as heartwarming and affectionate as a movie can get without getting too sappy. The first half of the movie is pure comedy, showing how a hapless boy and an erratic girl get to know each through a series of humorous hangouts. The girl only gives a glimpse of the inner turmoil she suffers in the first half. The second half explore her pain more deeply and also explains why the boy is willing to put up with her outrageous and unpredictable behavior. The last part brings everything full circle.I will also say, this movie is so good because the two lead actors have unbelievable chemistry. Gianna Jun particularly had an Oscar worthy performance and indeed probably would have won an Oscar for a similar performance in a Hollywood film. But sadly this gem of movie hasn't gotten the international attention that it deserves in my opinion. Not just one of the best Korean movies, but one of the best movies ever in any language."], "245": [], "246": ["One of the best things about Lookout is the thrill that gives, with the whole finding the culprit and making the bad guys pay theme blending well with the strong female protagonist and the high tech team. The cases are okay, though the main case with that criminal mastermind high school boy. Actually, that boy's performance was really good, playing the manipulating murderer who's still a minor. But, the other actors' performances were great as well, bringing a freshness to the whole drama. However, even though I did tried to really like this drama, something about it made me tired of watching it. Though the actions scenes were a handful, the actual plot was a bit of a series of bad people not getting the punishment they deserved and as a result people suffered. So, maybe the concept wasn't that well executed. Nevertheless, a good action drama, so 5 out of 10.", "This series was very enjoyable; to this day it's still one of my favorites. The plot contains mystery, revenge, remorse, temporary happiness-so many things that were mixed quite well into 32 episodes. This approximately 16-hour worth series entertained me a lot, although the ending was slightly disappointing. I loved Jo Sooji's character, and the fact that Lee Siyoung, the actress, was pregnant whilst doing all the stunts herself only increased my respect for her as well as my love for this series. Kim Youngkwang (Jang Dohan) and Park Solomon (Yoon Siwan) easily climbed up my favorite actors list. They're so talented.", "The drama has a cool plot and the actors are skilled enough to make you hooked up! Here, Kim Young Kwang can be compared to legendary actor Health ledger for his superb characterization of a very complex character. Park Solomon, the main antagonist is a minor yet delivered such a strong acting that can give you chills. Lee Si-Young was the real gem as an strong badass female lead. And the supporting roles were also pretty good. So it's a real deal if you care to watch some good acting!\nBut honestly, even with this much strong points, the drama lacks proper synchronization. Korean dramas usually has some inevitable plot holes and dragging but their audiences rather likes it that way. But if that bothers you, it might not be your cup of tea.", "With a story and plot with an 8/10 all the up way to the 14th episode, the show turns for the worst. A lot of things don't make sense, the characters all of a sudden go from smart and onto it to dumb and dare I say stupid and the last 2 episodes produced just seem sloppy!

My main problem with this drama was that it was kind of hard to keep up. The events followed one another too quickly and you had to pay attention to two stories and not just one. Honestly, the 2017 story was better than the new earth one, but they were equally entertaining nevertheless. The performances were really good, as the actors had to deal with a action packed theme. Also, the mystery was quite intriguing, even though the whole bug thing was gross. Fortunately, there wasn't too much blood, as the drama focused more on the mystery rather than impressing with gore and sci fi technology.

The leading couple goes trough a lot of psychological changes, sometimes you're upset with them, sometimes you agree with their behavior, but this feels like life itself.

Sometimes it turns into a cartoon with all the sound effects and slapstick but thankfully it's not over the top with that.The actors are fun and some of the cases make it seem like a soul successor to the ace attorney games.\nTwo flaws that stop me from giving it more stars. first the shameless Papa Jones product placement. It's too heavy handed and makes me want to order Pizza hut after each episode out of contrariness!\nSecond is the padding.

Great job SP", "In kdrama, many of the lead couples illogically live together and romance then occurs. This is too much a convenient way for a love story.

Wish Him all the very best and Good Luck in the Military", "Suspicious Partner started seriously strong. The mystery was interesting and thrilling, with gripping trial cases, though the main one was the lead, since the main characters were involved. The romance was strong as well as entertaining, with the two characters having chemistry and tension enough to make the love story interesting. However, towards the end, the drama couldn't hold the interest high. The mystery-murder case was solved too early or rather the drama should have been shorter by a few episodes. Especially the final episode was aimless, as the story had already concluded a few episodes ago. The romance got tiring and bleak as well. In addition, the leading lady's character got a bit annoying.

It'll have a bit more over acting and less serious lines or scenarios.", "The benchmark for Korean & Chinese top rank film & TV seems unjustifiably skewed higher in nearly all reviews by those outside the culture. Characters & actors & scripts are nitpicked to a degree that U.S. productions aren't, and ignorant cultural biases are applied to character motivation that demonstrate total lack of awareness of difference in cultural mores. The very high level of self-parody done well that is lauded to the hilt in western efforts like the TV series Chuck is derided unappreciatively as shallow simpering, career trademark of Jim Carrey. Most of all, the production quality, in particular the substantially superior picture resolution & camera work, gets no mention. Again & again, I've been left agape at the beauty of just the picture or scene setting or camera staging in Chinese & Korean production that is so evidently a quantum level above even the best of what I see come out of Hollywood. Much of that seems to utilize the 16:9 aspect ratio with a panoramic sensibility missing altogether in western cinema weaned on the 4:3 TV screen so cripplingly dependent on the close-up of faces. Although I have only watched the first episode so far, I hesitate to binge watch this excellent series because just the one episode was so full of skilled nuance both visually & dramatically. K-drama is often derided as overly melodramatic, and I suspect the many lesser productions I never saw that constitute by far the bulk of the genre are such. But that has made the best of it, such as this show, all the more poignant as a result of its makers being well practiced in conveying passion on the screen.", "The first few episodes may seem odd to other people but overall it's really good.

This was my first K-drama and it did not disappoint-- I am completely hooked. The plot was complex enough to keep my interest, along with a few comedic moments here and there.

And if you weren't into korean actors before... this show will change you.", "I actually like the action part of this show more than the \"romantic\" aspect of it. I found the girl to be a bit annoying. With all the far more beautiful women that kept popping up on the show, I would have expected the lead woman to at least be more interesting and likable. She had high expectations of a guy who she really was only \"dating\" for two days. After finding out he was a special agent and using her, she expected everything to be back to normal afterward and didn't understand why he \"left\". There were just certain aspects of her character that just made cringe a little. I hope he runs off and leaves her at the end because she really is dragging down the show. I'm only on the tenth episode and getting close to my breaking point because of her character. I just don't see the chemistry between the two of them. Ick... Although, I'm continuing to watch the show because of the action and the bromance between the two guys. It's kinda cute...", "I truly enjoyed watching Man To Man. Park Hae Jin is quite an actor and extremely handsome! The shots of PHJ are breath taking. This drama is the best eye candy if you're a PHJ fan! I was most impressed with PHJ range of acting. He can be quite funny and he's superb as an agent. Many folks had negative remarks about the lead actress. But I actually liked her. The entire cast did a good job! Can't wait to see the movie Cheese In The Trap with PHJ!", "The first scenes were really like hollywood style, visuals and sound effects. But as the story progressess it was kinda boring and monotonous. I also felt that the main lead does not appear as a cool special agent guy.", "I wanted to like this show. I really did. I was looking for something light and fun, and from a technical standpoint, it looked promising; the cinematography, stunts and music are polished and the cast has some solid actors. But for some reason, I just couldn't get into it. I'm a k-drama veteran so I know that the first 2-3 episodes of a show can be a bit bumpy, and I also dislike giving negative reviews, so I hung in there, hoping it would grow on me. But after 5 episodes I finally gave up. The characters just felt so half-hearted and I didn't buy the romance at all (which is the core of the show).To be fair, I was just coming off of watching Mr. Sunshine and A Korean Odyssey/Hwayugi (both fantastic productions with epic love stories), so I suppose anything would pale in comparison. Still, I can't help but feel something critical is missing. I hesitate to blame the acting, since Min-Jung Kim (female lead) delivered such a stunning performance as Hina in Mr. Sunshine.Speaking of her, I have to say the stylist did her no favors in this show. She was so beautiful and elegant in Mr. Sunshine, it was a pity to let her looks be downgraded by a poorly chosen hair style.Kiss scene rating***: 6/10. I only saw 1 kiss, but that was enough for me. The kiss itself wasn't badly acted, the leads just had zero chemistry, so to me it felt awkward.Sorry, I can't really recommend this show. I will revisit it at a later date to see if I should revise my opinion.******It can be frustrating to get so emotionally invested in a romance, only to be let down by a less-than-satisfying kiss (whether it's a lack of chemistry, depth or quantity). So I give kiss scenes a separate rating.", "Park Hae Jin is so adorable and i find it kind of weird he's playing such a tough roll but I guess he can pull it off lol. The sound effects<3 Park Sung Woong lol he's funny too<3 but omg for about 4 mins Song Joong KI!<3 I love that man! lol The villainy is great too. Only on episode 9 but IT'S SOOOOOOO GOOOD", "This is hard series to classify ...a comedy but with some real action drama including a phenomenal fight sequence in one episode.On the other hand the comedy aspects are at time extremely funny and satirical. The Bromance aspect is very funny ... brother!Overlaid is a traditional Korean corruption tale ..crooked cops...politicians and corporate executives. Good spies and bad spies ....but the plot almost doesn't matter ...just sit back and enjoy a fun cast doing what they do .. and doing it very well and don't take anythign too seriously.But I am still trying to get used to Korean etiquette ,,,it is really a cultural shock!", "Trawling Netflix and saw this so I thought I'd give it a go. It's awful. Not clever, not well acted and not well directed. Fails pretty much on every level. The plot was a little difficult to follow with some story line jumps that had me wondering if an advertisement had somehow inserted itself into the episode. In fact it was so confusing I kept watching just to see if some massive editing glitch had spliced a completely different show in. Mild spoiler here, at one point the hero, a rather effeminate looking super spy, is apparently blown up in his car. The suspense rates a zero as the clich\u00e9d and expected scene of him walking away before it blows is inserted shortly thereafter. What was really odd is that the girl, supposedly traumatised by his death, would have had no trouble seeing him walk away. But that is just a minor quibble. Overall the show is amateurish and uninteresting.", "Didn't not expect this drama to be this bad. The main story didn't seem like something crazily interesting, but still, the first episode was promising. However, the drama was tiring, with a boring plot that dragged on and on, with no actual twists, no chemistry between the actors (not even the couple was good) and no humour. That resulted to prevent me finishing this one, and I rarely leave dramas like that. I mean, I was able to force myself to watch to the beautiful you, when the plot got so predictable and boring, I could feel hours of my life being wasted for nothing. But this drama was even worse. Maybe I was expecting more out of it, as the cast was maned by seriously good actors. So, what happened? I blame most of it on the story that was an actual mess. So, 2 out of 10."], "258": ["This drama started okay, though you do not expect those scenes in a k drama (not that I minded, but it was a surprise). The story is okay, kind of interesting, especially when it came to the little boy's real family (the boy was adorable by the way!!). But then, from episode 10 till the end (thank the production that made it only 13 episodes long, there would have been zero point in dragging the plot for another 3 episodes), the episodes were a few new scenes and everything a repeated parade of flash backs, from everyone's point of view. That was my main problem with this drama. Actually, the performances weren't bad, and the love triangle had it's moments. So, 4 out of 10.", "I really enjoyed this show. It has a more adult type scenarios than most kdramas, but nothing explicit. I enjoyed the chemistry, the sweetness, and the twist of fate plot. It's not perfect, but it is fun.

I hope you'll agree and watch it.", "My only regret concerning this drama is that I didn't pay the necessary attention to it sometimes and missed out (so, this is going for a re watch soon). The story of this drama is as compelling as interesting. The one twist follows the other, as the story unfolds slowly its layers. The first part deals with the mystery of the ghost. Then, it starts focusing on the past affairs, as well as the currant ones. It's amazing how the film makers managed to present the medley of past present so beautiful, without confusing the audience or tiring them. In addition, there as so many things one has to anticipate to happen, except from the past story, that is by itself entertaining and well executed, with the costumes on point, the whole atmosphere of the past and the secret revolution- resistance presented as such as it didn't look fake, rather, it could have been easily compared to a movie's class. Lastly, the performances were great, and you can't help but eventually get emotional (even though, with most ghost dramas you kind of expect that to happen) towards the end, which, unlike other dramas that usually the story ends in episode 14 or 15 and the last one is just there to complete some side stories, this one was as entertaining as the rest. Probably, the only thing that didn't appeal to me as much as the rest of the stories, was the today's romance. The couple seemed to lack some of the chemistry they had compered to the past story. Plus, I would have liked for the film makers to have completed some of the side stories as well and not just the main one. But, overall, it was a great drama so I'm rating it with 8.5 out of 10."], "261": [], "262": [], "263": ["'Whispering Corridors' is set in a South Korean all-girls high school, focusing on a senior class and four of its students. Although it's a horror film, Whispering Corridors seems to be a drama at heart. The school building is very atmospheric and eerie, and there's some spooky shots of long corridors and deserted classrooms. Along with that, we also explore the extremely competitive and harsh South Korean education system, identity and reputation, and the relationships between the four students and one teacher.After the suicide of Mrs Park (or 'Old Fox' as she's known amongst the pupils), rumours begin circulating around the school about what caused her death. Girls fall out, and come together; there's a ghost who apparently haunts the old, disused art room, and people aren't who they first appear to be...A thinking man's film indeed, this will have you scratching your head in some parts. Not a lot of blood, but some tense scenes of violence. A chilling atmosphere and setting endures throughout, the director certainly knows how to set a scene. He also gets the best of the cast, who are all exceptional. Mr Oh; aka Mad Dog, is a particular stand-out as a vile, abusive teacher. Altogether a very character and theme driven story, with interesting social commentary. If you like slow-burn, atmospheric, subtle horror, you'll like this. P.S. There's an intriguing quote towards the end, where a character says \"It didn't matter who I chose as long as I filled the seats.\" A comment on the emphasis upon status and reputation in the classroom, and thus, lack of identity? Or a jab at the thought that Asians look really similar? (At least to those from outside Asia.) Or both?", "The look of the murky and desolate school corridors where sunlight cannot reach during the afternoon lessons had always given me the creeps. This movie was on the silver-screen while I was in Grade-10, in Turkey. My friends have gone to see it, yet they were so indisposed afterwards. However couple weeks before its screening, we've seen a Jennifer-Love Hewitt flick \"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer\" that was when we had finished that horror movie with belly laughs and roll in the aisles. I was curious to see and to know what was not to laugh of somebody's frightening of ghosts. Somehow, even though my friends were irritated of it, Whispering Corridors made a good box-office hit in Turkey. It must have inspired some serious masses, that in the first decade of 2000s' Turkish Horror-Suspense Fiction have used remarkable pieces from Whispering Corridors whether directly or indirectly. Then Taylan Brothers adapted a low-quality copycat from this already adapted adaptation. Making double adaptation for a piece of art didn't make sense on the payoff and the viewer felt it thoroughly. No one ever liked this adaptation; and it remained as a pathetic Turkish version: Okul(2004). That failure of Turkish cinema made me search for its origin. Yet till yesterday I hadn't have a chance to see this psycho-horror.Now watching it for the first time after 10 years of its release, it's clear to realize that Horror is no Horror if there is no Psycho in it. Whispering Corridors is para-psychologically successful and realistic. People know in secret that these types of extra-ordinary and super-natural happenings do really occur in real life.The story takes place on a country-side all-girl private school in South Korea, the year 1998. Presumably on a Sunday, the day before the new semester starts, the president of the teachers' committee of the school(Mrs.Parks) is getting killed right after the killer stole the 1993 and 1996 student yearbooks. We -the viewers- get 3 clues of the killer that she has the capitals P.C. from her desk, she commits her murders barefoot and she carefully leaves no evidence making the murders seem like suicides. After the semester starts, one of the male teachers of the school entrusts a class of girls with a task to hush up the rumours about the suicide among the students of the whole school. For this purpose, every week the committee of teachers choose \"the clerk for the week\" out of students of the same class. Meantime, there is a very strict racism storming in the air among the teachers for the student children of the Shaman families. A girl from the chosen class, whose mother is a Shaman priestess, begins getting affected while she used to call spirits to reveal the exam scores before they're announced or reveal whoever is virgin or not among her friends. That way, her friends always show respect to her, frightening of her but loving her at the same time. Soon, we get more clues about the murderer after she kills the night guard of the school. The murderer is very unpredictable, and the best thing is that each time when the mystery takes control on us trying to solve the murders; the murderer is getting killed. So, technically the spirits which curses the school and those students who are cursed-each time a new student- were the actual offenders. One by one girls of the chosen class lose their minds and in order to kill their victims they must trade their souls in with the spirits, so that the spirits can manipulate them kill their victims.Technical aspects are very low due to the low budget. Even though the audio quality is considerable. To capture the actors' voices more clearly I don't think the film crew had a boom operator though. The tensioned atmosphere is the true accomplishment of the camera movements, some degree of lighting adjustments, camera locations and chosen angles. Storytelling is very ambitious that despite the editing is mediocre, still the film keeps its fluency. Only watch out for the last 20 minutes! It becomes a captivity of total paranoia.While I was staring empty-minded at the closing credits, witnessed on how easy the deepest emotions of a human heart can destroy everything in one's life; I asked myself how in earth can someone make a movie like that so as to reveal what's unseen of the psychopathic murders. What a brave and hard job! What an amazing concept! If only it could have been produced more attractive to the viewer with a better screening quality, a better acting, a better screenplay, a better editing. The total commitment and self-belief of the production crew carries its importance to the highest standards; there we are taught how important the pre-production phase of a raw production material which was based on a very widely known and so told school rumour.If producers who are only looking for gaining box-office receipts with a horror movie and they hesitate to scratch and scrabble the concept of the fear; then they cannot reflect the reality or it just remains unreasonable as a work of imagination. For Yeogo Goedam didn't fall into this trap, it's a must-see cult horror.", "In the haunting opening sequence, we witness the mysterious death of a teacher at a South Korean all girls school. She is discovered by her pupils (her hanging body is a nightmarish image that will tattoo itself on your memory), and their abusive principal tells them it was a suicide. Before she died, she telephoned her young coworker and told her that \"Jin-Ju is here. She's still alive!\" Baffled by this, the young teacher embarks on an investigation to figure out what exactly is going on at this school. She finds that the ultra-competitive students are not what they seem on the surface.In its trailer, \"Whispering Corridors\" is credited as being the film that started the \"Asian Horror Explosion.\" I'm not so sure about that, as Ringu is far better known and appears to have been released first. However, this truly is an excellent supernatural story that deserves as much recognition. While the movie leans heavily on drama and mystery, the frightening scenes are very effective. Those that take place in the long ominous hallways in the empty school at night, as well as in the condemned art studio, are incredibly creepy and atmospheric.The performances by the entire cast, especially the young actresses, are excellent. Throughout the film, we are introduced to several of the repressed but competitive girls. There's the insecure nerdy girl who believes in magic, her best friend who is desperate to be popular and secretly wants to be an artist, the prettiest girl who is also at the top of the class, and the vicious-eyed girl who is second in rank and never utters a word. As the body count increases, the viewer is given several hints as to why each of these girls (as well as the violent and lecherous principal) could be a suspect.The film culminates with a sappy sequence that will likely cause you to eyeroll through it is duration, but it is easy to forgive this melodrama after seeing the chilling final shot of the film. The chronology may be confusing for some (though it is much easier to follow than many Asian supernatural horrors!), but all the sideplots are nicely tied together in the final sequences. What makes \"Whispering Corridors\" especially interesting is its strong underlying message of solidarity above competition in young women. Not only was I surprised to find social commentary of this type successfully incorporated into a horror movie, but I was doubly astounded to find it in one from South Korea. Yet, the messages here are especially potent because they are universal. I wish this unique horror film could find a larger audience because it deserves to be seen by more people.My Rating: 8/10", "Whispering Corridors is a totally scary, and entertaining horror flick from Korea. It's easy to see why this was the first of an explosion of Asian Horror films like the Ring and the Grudge, because the director, Park Ki-Hyung is definitely well versed in American horror and uses his understanding of the genre to make the movie really appealing to any American horror fan. Whispering Corridors is the first in a trilogy of films. The first death in the movie and all of the rest are really reminiscent of the slashers like Friday the 13th and other late 70's early 80's American horror which are the staples of the genre. If you like horror films and have seen the best ones, you'll immediately see why this one fits right in to that group. What's really cool about it, is that there's no CG (computer generated effects). All of the blood and deaths etc. are all done with real actors, and it's almost more believable than the over-the-top current American horror genre. There's something so tangible about the blood in the film. It's bright red, and creeps the viewer out in a way that CG children running around (like in the Grudge) could never fully achieve.The whole film takes place around an all girls school-- and with girls in uniforms and mysterious murders, you've got the makings of a great horror narrative. The first 20 minutes really suck you into the story as Ki-Hyung moves the camera much like 70's DePalma or Hitchcock--It's seductive. The school building becomes horrifying in and of itself. The way Ki-Hyung presents the school makes it like an evil edifice similar to the Overlook Hotel in Kubrick's The Shining.The tone is similar to Rosemary's Baby in that the girls are consistently trying to figure out what the problem is-they want to get to the bottom of it, but the forces out of their control, i.e. the school teachers, get in their way, and they get in trouble. The grainy look of the film and the way the sound design/score are used is totally an homage to the classic horror films of the 70's. In the movie, the Korean school system is depicted as an evil force that represses the girls, abuses them, and ultimately is the motivating force that makes the one girl commit suicide and become the ghost who murders her enemies throughout the film. The performances by the girls are great. And the colors of the film are so dreary, that you can't help but feel like you're there. The end of the movie has a really amazing image of the two main girls alone in the classroom with blood pouring out of the walls and the ceiling. Overall, this film is really entertaining, and psychologically interesting, and will scare the crap out of you. The Tartan DVD release is pretty awesome. It has trailers for a lot of Asia Extreme films, 5.1 surround sound, photos, and English/Spanish subtitles.", "I really didn't expect much going into this film. I think I'd been burned by too many mediocre horror movies featuring ghosties in the past, so to watch one of the grandmamas of the modern Asian ghost girl genre had me bracing for every trite conceit that could be thrown my way. Whispering Corridors surprised me. Rather than really being a flashy story about hauntings and killings, it turns out more to be an exploration of the impact of the brutal South Corean high school system on the youth that attend it, using the horror genre as the medium.First of all, I have to say that I wasn't frightened during this film. Not even for a brief moment. Rather than suspense and thrills, I was hooked into the mystery and dramatic elements that were at play. The way that the story is spun, there's no question as to who the ghost was or why it's doing the haunting, but rather, what the ghost's secret is. Now, astute viewers will pick up in the first few scenes of the film what we're looking for and I even managed to make the correct guess at it--although I really just had to watch to have my guess confirmed.Another interesting aspect of the story is that there are three stories going on. One about an artistic student trying to express herself in a system that cares little for her expression, another about a former student who returns as a teacher trying to make peace with her memories and the last about a student rivalry between a model student and the second-rank peer. The strength of this approach is that we anticipate the collision of the separate story lines and are rewarded when they do collide. The weakness of the approach is that the story has to juggle three (well, really two--the third is a B-story) protagonists and sometimes seems to suffer from a lack of focus.The film was clearly made in an era of Corean film-making that hasn't yet reached its more modern proficiency and the equipment/film stock used will have an almost grindhouse/direct-to-video feel to it for those who are only used to modern American/European cinema. Nevertheless, while the directing nor acting is spectacular, it is presented sufficiently as not to serve as a detraction from the story.All in all, this is actually a pretty decent film, even if it's not as much of a horror film as I was expecting. The interesting intertwined story lines and the use of horror to explore societal and personal burdens (and with some measure of tact) left me pleasantly surprised with Whispering Corridors. I can't recommend it to all viewers as the aesthetics might turn off those only looking for beautiful films and those looking for scary ghost or gorefests will be horribly disappointed. But this is an interesting look at the Corean high school experience as well as an intriguing mystery. So, recommended to those with open minds and a willingness to look past the genre for the story within. 8/10.", "After a teacher, Mrs. Park, is found dead from apparent suicide at the Korean girls school where she works, teachers try to squelch rumors and disparaging remarks that might sully Mrs. Park's reputation. But it's long been rumored that the school has a ghost, and after a young replacement teacher, Eun-young, arrives, both rumors and strange occurrences gradually increase until more lives are threatened and a mystery is revealed.Whispering corridors is a typical Asian horror film in that it's relatively slow-paced much of the time and wide open to interpretation. It also features a young female ghost of sorts, which westerners are already familiar with as a classic Asian horror archetype from versions of The Ring (aka Ringu) and The Grudge (aka Ju-On). More unusually, it is set in a single, often claustrophobic and always atmospheric environment. And along with its horror, it presents intriguing social criticisms and a poetic subtext about friendship.The bulk of the film is centered on what turns out to be the real villain--a fascistic, abusive approach to education, especially exemplified by Mr. Oh, who is also sexually predatory towards some of his students. But his strict, abusively disciplinarian approach is school policy, so we also see other teachers berating, humiliating and striking students. Combined with the usual human biases/favoritism and complex, wider cultural attitudes towards maintaining particular kinds of public appearances, we have a recipe for eventual disaster, which Whispering Corridors delivers.As should be expected, most of the horror material in the film is surrealistic and understated. Director Ki-Hyung Park has a knack for creating and finding creepy environments in the slightly dilapidated school--the hallway is particularly striking. Although there are a few suspenseful \"attack\" scenes that are more similar in tone to modern U.S. horror films, shots focused on simple visuals such as bloodstains and dripping/running blood are just as effective. The key to the film's horror is its gradually strengthening sense of unease, which is fueled by the more traditionally dramatic elements of the film as well.The ending has a twist somewhat akin to The Sixth Sense (1999) or The Others (2001), although note that Whispering Corridors predates both of those films. The twist is also much more purposefully ambiguous than American audiences are used to, allowing for a number of different interpretations.A major subtext is friendship. Students throughout the film are constantly seeking friends, building relationships, testing bonds, setting boundaries with others inside or outside of friendships, experiencing growth apart from friends with sometimes traumatic effects, and trying to strengthen various kinds of connections--there are even extremely subtle suggestions of romantic bonds between some female students. Most of the teachers are dealing with complicated relationships, as well, between each other and between themselves and students.Whispering Corridors is a complex, sometimes difficult (not negatively so) film that would surely reward multiple viewings. Although it's a horror film on some surface levels, and very rewarding at that, its heart is more of a poetically dramatic picture of its subtexts and social commentaries. Like much non-U.S. horror, it is worth viewing, but fans only used to American films will have to adjust their expectations in terms of pacing and clearly stated, linear plotting.", "While investigating the school files, the frightened teacher Mrs. Park startles and calls the young teacher Eun-young Hur (Mi-yeon Lee), telling her that the deceased Jin-ju Jang is back. The line dies and Mrs. Park is attacked and killed by a ghost. On the next morning, the teenager Jae-yi Yoon (Kang-hie Choi) waits for her friend Ji-oh Lim (Gyu-ri Kim), who has the ability to call the spirits, and they begin a close friendship. The abusive and aggressive Mr. Oh, a.k.a. Mad Dog, is the substitute of Mrs. Park and prohibits Ji-oh to paint and compares the performances of the pretty So-young Park (Jin-hie Park) and the weird Jung-sook Kim(Ji-hye Yun), raising a barrier between the two former friends. Miss Hur misses her former friend Jin-ju, who committed suicide, and while trying to contact her, she discloses a dark secret about the past of her friend and Mrs. Park.I believe that the first point that impresses in \"Yeogo Goedam\", a.k.a. \"Whispering Corridors', at least for Westerns, is the abusive treatment spent by the teachers with their students, brutally spanking and offending the harmless girls. I do not know if it is usual and acceptable this behavior of teachers, or if the intention of the director is to criticize and denounce how terrible this type of education might be. The story about friendship, needy and revenge has a magnificent cinematography, movements and angles of camera and some subtle insinuation of lesbianism. The performances are very convincing and my vote is six.Title (Brazil): Not Available", "Whispering Corridors has much in common with the current tide of horror movie offerings from Japan. However, it is hardly derivative. The material may be recycled, but the filmmakers present it in a way that is different and anything but stereotypical. Don't watch this film expecting to see a massive body count and flying limbs. There are moments when you will see why this movie is classified as a horror film, but like most ghost stories, the power of this movie is demonstrated by what the filmmakers chose not to show us. The pace is slow and deliberate. I found it almost hypnotic, but it never lags. Some of the story elements are very convoluted, but ultimately this does not detract from the overall appeal of Whispering Corridors. A movie for the thinking horror fan.", "Alright, in fact, Yeogo goedam is fairly a well-made horror teen-flick. It has some scary moment in places, and overall, amusing to watch. When you say this is a copycat of traditional Japanese high school horror, that is certainly not true.  Yeogo goedam goes deeper revealing on problems of a high school system in Korea, and presents a lack of respect between relationship of students and faculties.  Most students in the movie are depressed and having difficulties of their own; those qualities are what make Yeogo goedam better than most of horror teen-flicks made in other countries.  However, watch Yeogo goedam2 if you have a chance, because it is way better than this one.", "Directed by - Park Ki-hyung. Year - 1998. Running Time - 105 min. Starring - Choi Se-yeon - Kim Gyu-ri - Kim Yu-seok - Lee Mi-yeonA Majin Vegeta ReviewTo start off let me say this film is to be best watched when you are alone, well its alright if your with friends and the lights are off, you get some shocks, but alone, with the lights off, in darkness, in your room, thats when your in for a real treat. Whispering Corridors is your typical ghost thriller/drama, and real blood thirsty, for some of the sicker members of society you'll enjoy the ear scene, you'll see.Anyways on with the plot, the film opens on a dark, rainy night in an all girls boarding school, a figure is seen standing in the rain, take a guess at who it could be, anyways the scene cuts to Mrs Park, AKA Old Fox, who also has a bad reputation amongst the school girls, shes speaking on the phone to Hur, Eun-Young, a new colleague and former student at the school, also Jin-Ju's best friend,She starts by saying \"\u0085Jin-ju is definitely dead\u0085 but she's still attending school!\" Yet before she can explain what she means, she is attacked and killed, left hung in the school.The next day, two girls, a quiet, shy girl by the names of Youn, Jae-yi (Choi, Se-yeon) and a talented artist Lim, Ji-oh (Kim, Gyu-ri), attending their senior year and the new class monitors who have to be in early and make sure everything is clean before school starts, on their routine they meet Kim, Jung-sook (Yun, Ji-hye), a strange girl who is rumored to be possessed by the spirit of Jin-Ju, and the prime suspect for the murder, being the first one in the whole school.After discovering Mrs Park, the girls are told to keep the cause of death quiet, so inspectors and press don't bother the school, Ji-oh however is really disturbed by this and feels the need to paint a picture of Mrs Parks death, to get the image out of her head, but the painting is seen and she becomes banned from the art block.Rumors begin around the school that during the course of Jin-Ju's like she was abused and beaten by Mrs Park, and therefore her ghost had returned to get revenge on her, Mrs Park had been abusing her, on account of Jin-Ju's mother being a Psychic and a Shamen.In every school their a few who like to play around with oui-ji boards and a girl by the name of Park, So-young (Park, Jin-hie), persuades Ji-oh to hold a s\u00e9ance, to find out if Jin-ju is still around.The s\u00e9ance is broken up by a teacher, Mr Oh (Park, Young-Soo) who has the nickname, 'Mad Dog', as he is abusive, both physically and sexually, towards the female students, and no, their is no scenes of sex in the movie in case that put you off.Meanwhile, Jae-yi and Ji-oh have become good friends, and Jae-yi offers to help Ji-oh's painting skills grow, but as Ji-oh is banned form the art block, she suggests using the old shutdown art block of the school to paint, which are supposedly haunted,Wil Jin-Ju's spirit take revenge on the abusive 'Mad Dog', and why is Eun-young having visions of her old best friend Jin-Ju? and whats with the sound of bells ringing around the school?, will these 3 be able to solve the mystery before Jin-Ju strikes again?Though if your looking for a film that has \"s**t yourself silly\" moments around every corner like 'Ju-On - The Grudge' or 'Ringu', then you wont find it here, although the scenes with Jin-Ju are very affective, theirs just not enough of this young ghost to keep you scared for very long.Yet this film manages to hold its own and was one of Koreas biggest box office hits of '98', with chills, not so much around every corner, but enough to keep you interested and lots of blood, this film IMO is one of the better Asian films to delight my eyes. Oh and the \"kick in the crotch\" twist at the end that just makes you want to cry is very well effective, i didn't see it coming at all. Entertainment - 10/10 Scares - 8/10 Ghostly Girls - 1, but a very scary one at that Bordem - 2/10Dark Slade Rating - 10/10As i was watching this i was gripped throughout and i actually cried a little at the end. It is without a doubt one of my favorite Korean movies and for those who have watched/seen this movie, i hope you will agree with me.", "Now here's a curious movie - a supernatural ghost story from Korea. Set in an all girls school(thought that might have got your attention)its the story of a class being haunted by the ghost of a classmate who dies in mysterious circumstances and seems to return every 3 years.It seems to be heading in obvious directions - Carrie one moment ,endless teen slasher movies the next but it neatly sidesteps these cliches and becomes something more interesting.Yes there are creepy corridor moments and a couple of spectacular deaths (that owe more than a nod in the direction of Suspria - as does the soundtrack)but it is fairly gripping throughout and there are some schocking scenes of male teachers beating the pupils - The Korean educaution Minisrty tried to get it banned.The ending is unexepected and quite enigmatic- so much so that I watched it 3 times (the ending that is) and am still not too sure.Well worth a look", "The malevolent ghost of a teenage suicide victim haunts the corridors of a Korean school, murderously attacking members of staff. New teacher Eun-young Hur (Mi-yeon Lee) investigates, eventually discovering the shocking truth behind one pupil's mysterious past.Spooky Korean ghost story Whispering Corridors was released the same year as Hideo Nakata's Ringu, but unlike its Japanese counterpart, it failed to become an international hit and never received the dubious honour of a Hollywood remake. To be honest, I find it easy to understand why: it's extremely slow moving and not very scary.That's not to say that there is nothing to like about the film: there's loads of lovely cinematography, quality acting, a haunting soundtrack, a nice array of easy-on-the-eye Korean cuties, and the story explores several interesting themes, including loss of friendship, coping with loneliness, and abuse of power. But with very little to set the spine a-tingling, I still cannot not help but feel a little disappointed\u0097after all, this is supposed to be a horror film, isn't it?5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.", "Having seen so many Asian horror films in recent months, I expected Whispering Corridors to be a lot scarier than it was, but I was still impressed with the consistently creepy mood that permeated the film. When it comes to movies, there are a few things that tend to be pretty effective in scaring me, like kids, clowns, and hallways. Hallways, especially. The Shining had a profound effect on me. Then there are things that are never scary, like screeching cats, and things that are never scary but generally still a lot of fun, like the walking dead. The movie borrows a lot from the horror films that have been pouring out of Japan and doesn't necessarily cover much new ground but is still a pretty entertaining thriller. Interestingly, I found that the best thing about the movie were the performances, some of which were outstanding. Acting prowess is generally not something you look for in horror films. (spoilers) There are some things that seem to be hinted at in the movie, although I'm not sure if they're all intentional. At the end when we learn that the ghost's job was to fill the empty seats, it seemed to me that the movie was making a crack about Asian people looking so similar. On the other hand, Asian people only tend to look the same to people who are not Asian. One of my roommates is Japanese and she says it's Americans that all look the same. There is also a hilarious bit of irony near the end when one character has a shard of glass pressed into her throat as she threatens to kill herself. She's pressing hard enough to draw blood and she says something like, \"The bloodshed must stop!\" Overall there are not a lot of memorably scary moments, but it is an interesting film that gives some insight into some of the surprising teaching methods practiced in Korea as well as a fairly interesting story. There's nothing new about haunted schools, but the mixture of that foundational premise and the Korean schoolyard environment make for a pretty interesting combination.", "Whispering Corridors spawned no less than four sequels. It seems fairly unknown outside Asia, though, which is a shame on the one hand but on the other hand good for those of us who enjoy searching for gems among movies not so known in the West. Although the stories of the Whispering Corridor movies are independent of another, they all take place in girl schools where the students suffer from high pressure, competition - and from hauntings. It's not all horror, though. In fact, the drama aspect is very strong.Perhaps Whispering Corridors could be scarier. But it has a heart. It makes you care about the characters and the tragedies they're involved in. I've been impressed by the young actresses' performances and the cinematography. Even though the whole movie takes place at a school, it never gets dull to look at. All this makes watching it an experience so much more rewarding than watching an ordinary teen slasher film.", "Whispering Corridors is a slow moving, but engrossing, ghost story set in an all-girl's school in Korea. There have been a number of Asian horror films released in the U.S. in the past few years, but as this one was made before most, I think of it more as a trend-setter than a copycat. While much of the horror is subtle and implied, there are moments where the horror slaps you in the face with some very vivid imagery. The rest of the story dealing with the relationships between the girls and the teachers is not the normal kind of thing I go for, yet here it's very well done. It doesn't seem as clich\u00e9d as most American films dealing with teens seem to be. The acting is top drawer and adds a lot to making the film work. I wish I could point out one or two of the performances that really stand out, but I don't speak Korean and all the names look alike to me.Whispering Corridors probably wouldn't work for those not patient enough to allow the film to slowly unfold. And while I may not have enjoyed it as much as some of the more recent Asian offerings like A Tale of Two Sisters, it's an enjoyable enough experience.", "**Some spoilers in this comment**South Korean movie \"Whispering Corridors\" is a horror movie which is not scary enough. Unlike \"Phone\" from the same country, the screenwriters of this movie did not succeed in maintaining the terrifying suspense throughout the movie. After the death of the sadistic female teacher and brutal male teacher \"Mad Dog\" Oh, the movie dragged on and on until its rather disappointing climax. At the climax an average-looking school girl apparition, who was in no way scary, appeared and explained the motivation behind the haunting. Convinced by the sincerity of her former friend Miss Hur, she goes back to the netherworld. This was not even one-tenth as scary as the climax of \"Phone\" where the apparition of Jin-hee, a murder victim, emerges from a wall and stares at her victim with her horrifyingly angry eyes. Jin-hee was a totally unforgiving monster. She has an uncompromising grudge, which even an average moviegoer can feel from the screen. How can the average-looking female ghost in \"Whispering Corridors\" measure up to Jin-hee of \"Phone?\" The only matter of note in this movie was the incredible brutality of the Korean teachers. The teachers slap, punch, whip and sexually harass the students, but the students take it with obedient \"Yes, sir.\" These teachers make some U.S. Marine Corps drill instructors look like cream puffs. If these teachers acted like this in the U.S., they would have been thrown in jail.According to my Korean acquaintance, teachers are allowed to use corporal punishment in South Korea. He also told me that the root cause of the brutality of Korean schoolteachers is the generations-old Confucian ideology. Followers of Confucian ideology believe that teachers can do no wrong and give teachers absolute authority over his or her students. And many modern Koreans pride themselves as being obedient followers of classic Confucianism. Just as the adage \"Absolute authority absolutely corrupts.\" states, the absolute authority given to Korean schoolteachers make many of them to act any way they want. Many resort to intolerable violence while some resort to sexual harassment. (Of course, I strong believe that there are many kind, respectable Korean schoolteachers like Miss Hur in this movie.)In conclusion, \"Whispering Corridors\" is just an OK movie. It should be obvious to any competent movie fan that \"Phone\" from the same country is a much better crafted horror movie.", "Whispering Corridors acknowledged as the movie that marks the beginning of modern era of K-Horror. It has been remade in other countries, and it is the first installment of Whispering Corridors series which only related by its title and same settings in all-girls high school (which I remember I had seen some of the movies in the series, but none were amazing enough for me).The movie follows two MC, the student who aspires to be a painter and the new teacher that was a student there, both encounters mystery and terror as suddenly, people starts to disappears and died.For me, rather than crazily looking for new innovation in the genre, what's important is stick to the formula and plays it well. Surprisingly, although I have seen many Asian horror movies, this movie is a direct instant classic. The way the ghost terrorizing the school, the tone of the movie, the script, all's resemble what has been missing from current horror when they strive to be something innovative and cool.I recognized many scenes in the film is quite slow in dialogue (the dynamic between characters' speaking scenes are too slow to me), and that's what you usually encounter in similar (Asian) horror film. I guess it's a taste, but for some scenes, I almost thought the students in this school aren't quite bright. Lots of dramatic sequences, probably it's the style that incorporated in that era.For those who enjoy the quirky ambience of a horror movie without trying to brave (like watching Visitor Q, Uzumaki, or else), or those who seeks for a cliche in Asian horror movie, this movie surely a notable example.", "WHISPERING CORRIDORS is a pretty interesting South Korean ghost story, set in a girl's school haunted by the spirit of a dead student. Released in the same year as RING, the Japanese hit that was to inspire dozens of derivative knock offs, its pleasing to see that this film avoids the clich\u00e9s for the most part. There's no long-haired, white-faced girl ghost here, just a melancholy spirit with a knack for bumping off brutal teachers in increasingly violent ways.The film is full of atmosphere. Indeed, the story is stretched out almost to breaking point, and the pacing extremely slow \u2013 especially around the midsection. The eerie atmosphere keeps you watching, along with an effective soundtrack full of those low, almost distorted notes (also used in RING) that instantly send a shudder down the spine. The low budget here is evident, and some of the performances are a little rough around the edges, but there was nothing that stopped me enjoying this.Even the 'Hollywood style' stalk-and-slash moments are well portrayed, especially an extended showdown between cruel teacher Mad Dog and the unseen spirit. Things get a little muddled at the climax \u2013 as they do in so many of these films \u2013 where twist comes upon twist in a short space of time. Personally, I would have preferred the surprises to be more spread out, but nonetheless the denouement impresses. This isn't grandstanding horror, and indeed it's not a film that I'll rush to watch again. But as an example of Asian horror, you could do a lot worse. A sequel, MEMENTO MORI, followed.", "If you have never witnessed a horror movie before, then Whispering Corridors will more than likely scare you. For someone like me, who has an entire bookcase devoted to horror movies, there was only one moment in the feature that caused me to jump. Although Whispering Corridors contains elements that are quintessential to the horror genre, it works best as a character drama, shrouded by mystery and suspense, revealing to us the hardships of education, especially in South Korean culture, and the importance of friendship.Though released in 1998, Whispering Corridors has lost none of its poignancy, and though I was late to jump on board the Whispering Corridors franchise (none of the films were ever released in my country), the movie is surely one that should not be missed. If you are after a horror movie that will scare the pants right off you, I'm afraid by the end, your trousers will still be firmly attached to your legs. At the same time however, Whispering Corridors is able to grab your attention right from the opening scene, and refuses to let go, even after you've ejected the disc from your player.Eun-young (Mi-yeon Lee) is a teacher, only recently employed at the same all girls high school she attended as a student nine years earlier. Her time there is far from normal after receiving an ominous phone call from her former home room teacher Mrs. Park, concerning her best childhood friend Jin-ju, who tragically died on campus, but is suspected of haunting school property. Immediately after this phone call, Mrs. Park's life takes a turn for the worse, and a group of students the next morning find her hanging from an overpass.Alongside Eun-young, three characters strongly focused upon are Lim Ji-oh (Gyu-ri Kim), a gifted artist, and the timid Yoon Jae-yi (Choi Se-yeon), who, although a bit of an outsider, is far more sociable than interloper Kim Jung-sook (Ji-hye Yun). Through witnessing these characters lives we experience the difficulties of the education system, the teachers doing all they can to benefit the talented intellectual geniuses of the class, while those under-par, or who put one toe out of line, are subjected to intimidation and cruelty.Despite many of the characters been teenagers, I found myself engrossed in their lives, not one of them ever annoying me, although the same can't be said for American films of the same genre. By returning to her high school, Eun-young is able to witness how nothing has changed since her time as an adolescent, as she remembers past events, while taking Mrs. Park's final words to heart. The characters in the film are brilliantly portrayed, the audience becoming deeply involved in their lives to the point that we aren't just sympathetic towards them, but genuinely care for their well-being.The suspense in this intriguing mystery is marvelously conveyed, viewers being required to experience every second of this film in order to comprehend the many plots that are taking place. Although there are scenes with blood, the film doesn't rely upon grotesque violence, nor in your face scares to keep your interest.Although there are a couple elements of the film that remain somewhat unexplained by the end, the audience, after receiving a plentiful amount of entertainment, are able to use their own imagination to concoct potential answers. With a series of terrific camera shots that compliment the story, alongside entertaining, well thought out characters, Whispering Corridors is an intelligent, moving feature that you simply must see.", "Very interesting movie to say the least. I was expecting a lot of death and thrills, but this is more of a soft toned mystery, mixed into a school where male teachers hit the high school young adults. There is very little blood, death, ghosts, and violence. I enjoy Asian Horror, and this is a little bit older, and kind of outdated. Wasn't exactly what I wanted, but I still liked it. It was not a master piece like we are use to. Basically you follow around students and teachers at a High School, after the opening sequence of death. It pretty much sets up the movie to uncover what happens in beginning, and most importantly \"why\". I honestly kind of got lost in the end, but it ended on a typical soft toned end.", "I'm only writing this review on account of a personal project of mine. I decided a few months back to write reviews about all Horror films I'd watch, in order to have sort of a library of reviews and remember my experiences with each film. Unfortunately, I am unable to be objective nor subjective about Whispering Corridors.While watching, I was unintentionally and uncontrollably hindered by two things. The first - I'm not sure if I found a bad translation, or if the Korean language is really as such. I'm afraid it was the first option, as I have no idea how 3 sentences could be summarized in 5 words. Half the time of most dialogues the screen was empty of text. As a translator, a poet and a former teacher - I know that no translation ever captures 100% of the original meaning, but in this case I couldn't help but feeling that I wasn't being exposed to lots of information, however redundant. And the second problem I experienced was my inability to differentiate the Korean female students. I am not at all racist, but they all seemed too much alike, and their names sounded too much alike... I guess I haven't seen enough Asian films and/or Asian people in my life, and I realize this is a shortcoming of myself and my life, and not the film.Taking all the aforementioned into account, I was completely robbed the film's twist, as I could barely understand. I was only able to interpret the music (which was excellent, by the way) and the event, but not completely experience the twist as someone who'd been successful in following and keeping up with the entire film would have. Therefore, I feel I cannot with a clear conscience rate this film. I can say good music and interesting dramatic shooting and cinematography, but that's all. And without being able to have an opinion of the acting,and most importantly the story - one cannot rate. So I can't recommend the film, and I can't criticize it. It did, however, feel to me like I missed out.", "Asian horror movies love to set ghost stories in all-girl schools, since that gives the movie lots of eye candy for gore junkies who also like to ogle hot teens in school uniforms. Unusually, the setting was more sharply drawn than is typical, with the harsh discipline, regimentation and repression of individuality so common throughout the educational world of the Far East playing a major functional and contextual role in the film. The high school setting provided a world of gossip, frustration, rivalry and threat in which the presence of ghosts was simply one other unpleasant aspect. The characters were drawn with an equally sharp pen, giving the movie more dramatic depth and impact than one usually sees as well. Normally, once the undead start knocking off the living in movies of this type, the horror is blunted by the fact that weak, uninteresting characters are being slaughtered, so who really cares? Here, good use of the setting and characterization made me interested in the goings on. Watchable and recommended.", "It's funny how the movie does nothing really bad but at the same time it also really isn't being a great or effective movie within its genre.Guess it's all because the movie isn't really being tense enough. Like I said, it does really not a whole lot wrong and I think it actually was a very deliberate choice to not make this movie a standard, formulaic horror flick. It instead went for the more intelligent approach, which however doesn't make this movie a very interesting watch though. It works for the mystery but a bit too well, you could say. You really have no real idea what is going on in this movie and the viewers are left in the dark for too long, without giving them really anything. This really doesn't make this the most interesting or spectacular genre movie to watch. It only builds up to its finale, in which everything falls together and gets explained. This however means that you first have to endure watching this movie for 90 minutes, or so, without getting an awful lot out of it.I just wasn't too impressed with the entire way the story before that point progressed. It progressed in a very uninteresting way, without any well build up tension and mystery to it.And I for one would had preferred it if this movie would had taken a bit of a more standard horror approach at times. It really would had added much more to the movie its tension and atmosphere. Some more killings and scary moments or gore could had already been enough for this. I'm not too sure about it that the movie now will make lots of horror-fans happy.Still it seems like the movie is popular and also was a success at the time, at least in South Korea, since the movie has so far already 4 sequels. I'm still going to watch those but I'm just not expecting too much from them, after having seen this movie.6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "The first part of the very loosely bound \"Yeogo goedam\" series that tell stories about supernatural events happening in Korean girl schools is the best one I have seen so far and easily beats the second and third part.This movie mixes everything a good psychological suspense movie needs. The opening scene is very dark and somewhat confusing. The atmosphere of the movie is creepy and addicting. The playing of the young Korean actresses is very well done and offers a multitude of intriguing characters. From time to time, there some supernatural events and surprises that take place but nothing that seems to be too unreal or out of vogue. Until the end you keep on guessing who is behind all the tragic events that take place throughout the movie and many scenarios are possible. After that, the film lets you on a mysterious and dark note and finishes the dark flick in a creepy way.The tension and atmosphere is always quite high in this movie. There are not many shocking effects or gore scenes but a dark atmosphere that equals and even overpowers the usual flicks of the same genre. The great acting and a few interesting revelations keep the tension high and develop the different characters.The only negative thing might be that the idea of such a movie is not quite new and that the final revelations could have been even more developed and surprising and I was expecting something more spectacular. But those are only two rather subjective points and though this movie is nothing pretty outstanding, it's at least worth eight points and I completely understand why the general idea of this first flick lead to a total of now four sequels. The movie is really entertaining and far better than the American high school horror movies. You don't have to watch the sequels that are less impressive, but this first movie should be on your list if you like Asian cinema or high school suspense movies.", "After watching this movie, I was relatively disappointed. This movie has got a decent storyline, but there are just too many plot holes in this movie that made this movie bad. The movie starts of very well, with an extremely frightening scene that kept me glued to the screen. A student wanted to take revenge because a teacher did something to her. The way this Mrs Park got hanged was frightening. After the first twenty minutes the movie just got really bad. There were just really very long boring conversations between the two girls. They just seem to keep on talking forever. Then there was one silly part where another girl in the art room pretends to say maybe I am the ghost and smokes to act cool. Then another long boring conversation was carried out between the two girls again. This show was not scary at all. It didn't even build enough tension and fear to the climax. The violent acts of the teachers were the scary ones. A really big plot hole for this movie is who locked Jin-Ju in the art room. This was not explained at all. I am still confused what 1989,1993,1996,1998 is all about. And why this pattern? The girls rang and rang and rang the bells so many times and is just so repetitive. At least there was one scary scene showing Jin-Ju attacking Mad Dog. This movie really shows the school system in Korea very well. The last few scenes of this film were unsatisfying. I could not figure out many stuff that were happening. Why did Jin-Ju turned her head back at the end? Why was the classroom empty? Why was blood being all over the classroom? Lots of questions just come to my mind. The acting towards the end of the film was not good, it was not convincing. When Jin-Ju was about to kill the teacher in the end why did the teacher frown? Was she frustrated? Sad? happy? I cannot understand her weird expression. This teacher also acted in Bunshinsaba and her acting did really improve a lot in that film. I could not understand anything towards the end of the movie. However some of the good merits to this movie includes, cultural interest, mystery and so on..... I have so far only watched wishing stairs and this movie and wishing stairs is by far a much better film than this. If you are interested in the whispering corridors series, watch wishing stairs. My rating for this movie:5.5/10"], "264": ["I don't watch enough world cinema, let alone South Korean films, the country that gave us incredible flicks like Oldboy and Sky Blue (Wonderful Days) so when I see there's a showing at my other local cinema, I had to go and I didn't regret it.Seong-hoon Kim, director of the highly acclaimed A Hard Day (now on my watchlist) tells us a story of a business man (Jung-woo Ha) who is on his way home to wife and daughter and unfortunately becomes trapped in a near fatal accident when a tunnel collapses on him and his car. We see his blight as he struggles to survive and how he comes to terms with the reality of what's happening. There's a superb balance between him and the outside world who is attempting to rescue him, witnessing empathy, sympathy and later tragedy but also the lack of, from the media and politicians causing conflict about what's the right thing to do. It's touching, when seeing the lengths people will go to in offering help in a time of crisis, like the radio station for example, playing him messages of support each day. This show of humanity reminded me of the epic TV movie of the late eighties, Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure and the more recent World Trade Centre, only fundamental difference, this not being a true story. Sometimes I felt like being a passerby, watching the train wreck happen right before you, seeing things going from bad to worse without being able to lift a finger to do anything. But on the flip side it's purposefully comical to display another side of what it is to be human. There's incredible performances for the three key characters, especially Cloud Atlas star Doona Bae who plays his grieving wife having to deal with the press whilst trying to do as much as she possibly can to aid the rescue. And Dal-su Oh is superb as the chief, who's in charge of the operation who has this moral obligation to save him. The film is loaded with tough decisions and moral issues questioning you, what would you do if you were either of the three characters. It did drag, but only ever so slightly for the 126min running time. Has got an amazing score from Young-Jin Mok and the set pieces are on point with some amazing camera work. I wouldn't recommend this for viewers with fear of tunnels or claustrophobia but a great drama with some amazing performances, a must-see for world cinema drama fans.

Now Lee must survive waiting for the rescue.\"Teo-neol\", a.k.a. \"The Tunnel\", is a dramatic thriller about the rescue operation to save a man trapped inside a collapsed tunnel. The storyline is engaging, with good performances and melodramatic dialogs between Lee and his wife. This disaster movie shows a sharp criticism to politicians that wants to use tragedies to show up with the victims; to the press that disturbs people that is seriously working to sell \"fresh\" news to the audiences; and to the quality of public constructions in South Korea. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil):\"O T\u00fanel\" (\"The Tunnel\")", "If they have cellphone reception, they could've shared or pinned his location via GPS on Line (The Messenger they use), Google Map, or whatever convenient app they have.

If you haven't seen A Hard Day yet, stop right now and go watch it...see what I mean? Well, Seong-Hun Kim, the director of that one, has a new one: The Tunnel. And it's over-the-top crazy. And over-the-top good.A car dealer, Jung-so, just closed a deal for a fleet of cars and it's his daughter's birthday and he's driving home with her cake and happily enters Hado Tunnel Number One (which apparently runs for about 475 miles through the most untraveled stretch of highway on the Korean peninsula) when the tunnel collapses. Always something, isn't it? And not just \"collapse:\" a friggin' apocalyptic cave-in of not only the tunnel but half the mountain, leaving only a few feet of the far exit still open. Jung-so's Kia sedan withstands a pummeling of rock and earth that would have flattened an Abrams tank (good cars, them Kias), living him dirty, bruised, intact, and trapped.He whips out his cell phone, which doesn't explode, and calls the most incompetent 911 dispatcher in the Korean peninsula, triggering the most epically inept rescue operation in human history. Apparently, about the only things that work well in Korea are Kias and cell phone towers (and the battery in Jung-so's phone, which lasts forever, and even his car battery which lasts even longer. Without exploding) because it turns out the tunnel was built by the most incompetent construction company in all of Asia, one that put in too few support rods and doesn't know how many fans it installed, nor where they installed them, and didn't bother to draw up the blue prints to any kind of scale or accuracy. And, which is in charge of building Hado Tunnel Number Two, a few feet away from where Jung-so is trapped. After about an hour, said company starts lobbying to resume blasting on its new tunnel because, hey, Jung-so is trapped in our first shoddily built tunnel so he's a goner so let's stop wasting time here and get on with it. All of which drives the rescue commander, Dae-kyong (played by Dal-su Oh of Oldboy fame)\u2015the only competent man in the entire Korean government\u2015nuts to the point he drinks a bottle of urine in solidarity with Jung-so.No, seriously.All of which emphasizes the point that, if you're trapped in a tunnel in Korea (or a haunted island, or a sealed apartment) you'd best start thinking about getting yourself out of this pickle because the government honchos in this movie don't put a whole lot of value on your individual soul. I don't know if that's Seong-hun Kim's particularly political viewpoint or the result of having a lot of crazy people to your north with nukes, but it doesn't take long before the ministries and bureaus and the population decide to write Jung-so off and get on with it. Now why they would allow the obviously inept construction company to get on with it, I can't say, but it may be due to the particularly gruesome death of a rescue worker (apparently saw blades in Korea are made by Samsung) which is blamed on Jung-so's wife, who apparently has the last say on whether Jung-so should be rescued or not (someone should check to see if she recently upped his life insurance). Scratch of the ole noggin' here because rescue workers who die on duty in the US are considered heroes, not victims. 'Course, we don't have crazy people to our north with nukes. Just bacon.It doesn't end all happy and resolved, but it does get resolved, primarily through the individual effort of the one or two motivated and competent people in this whole cockup. Which is a lesson. No one's going to save you but yourself.", "Movie: Tunnel (12)Rating: 4.5/5I haven't yet seen this director's previous acclaimed film but this one's poster, title, synopsis and trailer attracted me. And THE TUNNEL turns out to be the best survival film apart from TRAIN TO BUSAN.THE TUNNEL has a great deal of tension throughout. The film's premise is built very well. You do feel the suspense at right moments. The film delivers well on the technical front. The cinematography captures the splendid visuals very well. There aren't any hiccups throughout the entire film and you feel the character's pain. Ha Jung Woo is super solid in this film. This is his first film I've seen. Doona Bae and Oh Dal Su give terrific performances. The few action sequences are very well shot.And yes, this didn't let me move from my seat. I kept on watching and enjoying it till the end. It's a film that can be watched again. Full marks to the director Seong Hun Kim for executing a brilliant survival tale with excellence.Overall, THE TUNNEL is an excellent film that can be seen multiple times for its cinematic excellence and a hard hitting indirect message to all.", "A man is on his way home when the poorly constructed tunnel he is driving through collapses, leaving him trapped.\"Tunnel\" comes to us from writer-director Seong-hun Kim, who is likely not very well known in the United States, though some fans of Korean cinema may have seen his previous film, \"A Hard Day\" (2014). The star of \"Tunnel\" is Jung-woo Ha, who you will most likely recognize from \"The Handmaiden\" (2016), which is being heavily promoted by Amazon. (Perhaps the PR folks behind \"Tunnel\" can build off of this?)This is one of those films that works well because it relies on a very simple plot with a high amount of tension. We have just about the smallest stage possible (the inside of a car), though it does cut to other areas from time to time. (Would it work better if it just stayed in the car? Maybe.) Others have said the film runs a bit too long, and I have to agree. Although you can often make a \"slow burn\" go for two hours or more, this one may not hold the tension as well as it could. I don't know. Opinions will vary.\"Tunnel\" is out now (May 2017) from WellGo, available on DVD. Why it is not being released on Blu-ray is unclear, and the DVD is very much a bare bones affair. While the movie is good enough to stand on its own, there is literally nothing on the disc that would make it an improvement over a streaming option.", "The title says it all. Then I read its synopsis and right away I knew how much should I expect from it. Because this might be a fresh attempt in the Korean film, at least for the first time I'm seeing in a Korean film, but not from the world cinema. Yeah, I have seen plenty, and I'd liked most of them. But this film was much, much better than it had been rated in the internet. The story, the main event starts without wasting any time. There's no initial developments like intros. When the thriller-adventure parts commences, reveals everything you have to know.Just over 2 hours long, the story frequently switches back and forth to where a man got trapped in a collapsed tunnel road and the outside where people and rescue team gathered. Like any other similar themed film, it borrowed a handful of clich\u00e9s, but still you can witness the effort for the avoidance. Like if you see something or someone's crucial part come into play, usually you would predict what might happen to it in the later part of the story. Since those are unavoidable, they simply skipped in the final act as it is understandable and not to waste developing them to some extent.So a man is fighting for his survival after a disaster strikes. But he got a cell phone signal buried under a deep mountain that I could not get. Anyway, he does make know his state of condition to the outside world. Soon they all rally to get him out. This film is not entirely a serious episode, despite the theme was. A little bit of satire. If that's how the film was intended or not, at least I had a couple of good laughs. Kind of reminded me 'Peepli (Live)', about the media circus in such situation. But that is the truth, what todays media have become, because of competition among themselves.\u275dDon't be weak and say you'll die, just live.\u275eThe trapped man has to make sure about food and water to survive till the rescue team reaches him down which could take a week or more. Yeah, they kind of mention the recent Chile event which was made into the film, 'The 33'. His portion of the story is like the combination of '127 Hours', 'Buried' and of course that Chilean film. There are lots of things happen, you could say twists and turns. Kind of too much at some point, the way they added more contents to it, but decently it all worked out.Meanwhile, on the outside world, not lags behind. It has its own set of characters and its circumstance events. Lots of fun and also highlights wrongs. Particularly like I said, the media and how politicians make use of such incident for publicity. And the final one about the construction firms and their shoddy works for profits. They have dug on these topics, but did not go deeper, because to keep it lighter and entertaining film than all about awareness.All the way an engaging narrative. Means a long film, but very swiftly told story. Visually, it was a well made film, like everything's looked natural and believable. You could not differentiate the CGI/green screen work and the real objects of those disaster parts. But not the technical details such as drilling or the hollow space where he stays alive. When the narration progresses, it gets even worse, like you would say how could that even possible or just they wanted it that way to end the tale.A small part of the end kind of skips, but that's good for the film than dragging it for another half an hour. The casting was good, they all performed well, but my favourite was Oh Dal-su. As usual, I loved his part, one of the finest supporting characters in the world cinema. It's not a great film, but good, and acceptable as what it is. In the end feels like worth it. So I decided to suggest it for those who are interested, but could not decide whether to go for it or not, and for the Korean film fans outside the Korea.7.5/10", "t doesn't seem long ago when Korean film makers were dazzling the world with prizewinners at International festivals such as Oldboy and Pieta. As well as these harsh ,violent films there were gentle odes to Buddhism (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, and Spring) and the magnificent Untold Scandal, which set the story of Dangerous Liaisons in the Joseon Dynasty period. South Korea has one of the strongest national film industries of any country, but they haven't had an international hit for several years. Many of its most acclaimed directors have either gone of the rails (kim Ki Duk) or made films for America (Park Chan Wook and Joon- ho Bong.I watched Tunnel at Wimbledon cinema (shown there because of the large Korean community in New Malden). Although it was a perfectly decently-made film I wondered why it was so unusually bland. If it hadn't for the frequent jabs at the Korean government, or references to recent safety disasters such as the Sewol Ferry sinking, this could have been a Hollywood blockbuster.Driving to work one morning, car salesmen (Jung-soo) finds himself spending longer than he would to like at a gas station when an old man mishears him and puts to much petrol in his car. On they way, he calls his wife Se-hyun and tells her he has bought a cake for his daughter's birthday (why is it always the kid's birthday in these films?) Then, as he enters the tunnel, he is caught in the middle somewhere when a rockslide causes the tunnel to collapse.Luckily, he can still make communication with the outside world because his phone still has 82% battery; and even 150 metres underground he always has a perfect mobile phone reception. Calls are made between him and wife Seohyun, as well as the head of the rescue operation Dae-kyoung (O-dal su).MV5BMjE3ODYwODE2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5ODA2OTE@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182, 268_AL_I'm not sure why anyone would want to make a film about a man stuck in a tunnel. The possibility of doing anything new with it are so small. There's little in the way of tension. Although film tries to show the lack of water and how he must carefully ration at each ho The film only really becomes exciting when he learns that the tunnel is to be re-built after the chances of finding him alive are considered to low. Then he has to race against time to find his way out), although why he didn't think of this before I have no idea.Bae Doona has little to do in this film and we don't learn anything about their relationship beside the fact that they have a four-year old daughter. The film contains some humour (usually towards the incompetence of the tunnel builders who couldn't remember how many ceiling fans they had put in) and there's even a cute dog who has somehow survived under the fallen rubble.It looks like this film is one for Koreans only.Rating: 5/10", "Watched for third time still brings tears at the end", "Apart from the failure to take GPS into consideration and the ridiculous phone call to Mina's mother without knowing her number, there's the obvious assistance and companionship of Tengie to the end. Lee Jung-Soo doesn't even ask about Tengie. Remember that he told his wife he'd buy his daughter a puppy? The bizarre heartless failure to connect Tengie to the ending other than at a pet store is incredible. What terrible writing.The acting was good. Doona Bae is good. I could accept her acceding to pressure to stop the rescue, especially with the actions of the rescue chief. With a better ending could have accepted higher than the average rating at the time of my watching (6.9), but that complete failure to write in an ending showing more humanity towards the dog knocked the wind out for me.No way in hell I'd rate this 7 or above as others did (some even 10). I've seen some Korean movies by highly rated and award winning directors with the most incredible tasteless inhumanity to dogs. Maybe it's a cultural thing? I can't believe it. The best and most helpful review to me had great criticisms, but still rated it 8!I do like Korean movies and think many Asian films are highly worthy of watching even if you have to read subtitles. Yes, they're that good. The three main actors are really good and carry a badly written and poorly directed story. Just minor care in both those aspects could have made this a very good movie.", "Tunnel is a movie that I wish had a stronger directorial vision behind it. The concept of someone being trapped under a pile of rubble and rocks for two hours may sound like a daunting challenge - more than 'may', it is. To hold our attention and to mount suspense and create a connection to that character (especially if we don't know him, or her, super well before-hand) when it is a one-person show is difficult. Major pros like Robert Zemeckis (Cast Away) or Danny Boyle (127 Hours) can get to the nitty gritty by a) having a tremendous actor to anchor it, and b) to have some very distinctive settings or moments that let us out of the place we're stuck with the characters at (in one case a deserted island, in another trapped also by rocks). Put these two things together and you may have a vision of solitude and simple goddamn survival that can keep the audience's attention.In Tunnel, it's an OKAY type of that movie, but its first half gets bogged down through some comedy (yes, comedy, or what can come close to it here), and a side story where our main character, Jung-Soo (Ha Jung-Woo), already caught after driving through a tunnel that collapses all over the car, discovers a woman is trapped in her car (along with a very cute pug). It does add some humanity to the character, showing his kindness over little things like how to space out water, but she also doesn't last in the story very long and her impact on the outside world - this is one of those 'Timmy Fell Down the Well\" stories, of course, so the media covering it and the authorities and construction people working at the site become a whole entity unto themselves - isn't strongly felt.If it had been it could've added to something, but this is making me put aside what I did like about the film, which is primarily the second half. In the first section, as our Kia Dealer is still under (yes, he tells some random people, oddly unprompted, he works as a Kia dealer because... uh, product placement I guess?) it has the occasional odd jokey moment. Not necessarily a terrible thing, some levity or moments of lightness can help to punctuate the potential-certain doom this man is facing, but it's kind of clumsily done. Maybe it's funnier to South Korean audiences than to me, where things like a construction man picking up an egg after it's fallen on the floor due to a part of a roof collapsing from rain and eating it. For me, I kept thinking 'Uh, hey, guys, tension, suspense, start mounting it, come on!'But then we come to where things take a bad turn - it might even be more like 2/3rds of the way through (this is a 126 minute movie and it feels every moment of it) - as characters screw up, and in a way that no one is fully to blame for (outside of some gross incompetence, but not anything to get furious about), and it looks like it'll take longer and longer to dig our man out. And this moment is excellently played by Jung-Woo, when he is told the terrible news, and all the while his wife (Doona Bae, who you might remember from such films as CLOUD ATLAS, yes, that's her as the main girl, and JUPITER ASCENDING, so also some highly expressive, spot-on talent) is off to the side also angry and sad and embarrassed as a bad situation becomes worse and worse.I saw this movie as a double feature of my own making at the local cineplex where before the other film was Train to Busan. That is certainly the better film, but I was struck by how in both films, but this one it's stronger without being too in-your-face about it, there's this sense that humanity MUST work together, or things will simply fall apart (metaphor much with the tunnel collapsing and the, oh, nevermind). When it becomes a more dire story, the director Kim Seong-Hun, steps up his game for dramatic tension and down-to-the-last-OMG-minute suspense, and it picks up greatly. I didn't completely dislike those moments early on where they try to humanize everyone, but the tone felt off in a way that was a little distracting, also with that side plot that has affecting moments (how can it not with a woman trapped in her car), but the mood wasn't kicking, it lacked an energy or momentum for our hero that we could dig in to as well (or perhaps that sense of 'huh, will he really get out of this or not?) It's a decent and competently made movie with some excellent moments; if you're a connoisseur of Korean cinema I'm sure it'll make your day or night. It also doesn't make for essential thriller viewing either.", "TUNNEL is an exemplary addition to the South Korean disaster movie genre and the best I've seen of that genre thus far. The reason it's so good is that the story is small-scale and centred on a single character, so that you really get drawn into his situation and feel for him. In the hands of the excellent actor Ha Jung-woo he's a thoroughly sympathetic protagonist which is a rare thing these days. Jung-woo has played a killer in THE CHASER, a desperate assassin in THE YELLOW SEA, a spy in THE BERLIN FILE and now an ordinary guy in this, and he's been remarkably different in each instance, unrecognisable in fact, which is the mark of a truly great actor. TUNNEL focuses on single-location thrills but keeps the story moving with scenes on the outside which are actually interesting for a change, alongside twists and turns throughout you'll never see coming. The CGI is kept to a minimum and realism is high, making this all the more tense. As with most Korean thrillers, there's heavy satire present used to depict the incompetence of Korean officials, leading to some very funny moments. Doona Bae adds heart to boot. It's a great little film when put together.", "Tunnel surprised me. I had barely glanced at the cover when we picked it up, and put it on figuring it would be good background noise for reading my book.Well, the book didn't get read, but the movie did get watched.I liked how quickly it leaped right into things. No real build up, no explaining things, just suddenly this person is in a horrible situation, and now you've got to watch to see how it unfolds.There were a few humorous moments that injected some needed levity. Only one of them actually felt forced, and that was toward the beginning of the film so it was pretty easy to overlook.Within minutes of getting into this, I found myself texting one of my friends and telling her what was happening in the movie. Then texting my partner and telling him that Tunnel was one of the better movies we'd rented in a long time.This is a well-shot, well-acted movie. While it didn't blow me away, it did manage to get me completely wrapped up in it. Definitely worth watching!", "This movie was awesome. The director and cast did a great job of making the story come alive. You felt trapped with the main character. This film even gave me ideas about a possible future solutions. The story was evenly paced. The cinematography was outstanding. Thanks for making this film. For me the story just worked. If you have ever commuted before this movie is a wide awakening. Everyday and often we take many things for granted. Some of the most precious things we rarely value because we become overly familiar with them.", "The film was thrilling and exciting, but I did find the running time a bit too long. The film became a bit of a dragged out rescue mission, although it is never boring. I did find the silly-ish humor inappropriate at times considering the nature of the film and sometimes the rescue workers seemed incompetent. Then again, maybe is was just to lighten the mood a bit. In general, though, this was a great production with some really tense scenes, and also very claustrophobic at times.", "Lee Jung-soo is driving home with his daughter's birthday cake. He's driving through a tunnel when it collapses on top of him. His wife Se-hyun is desperate in the outside world. Dae-kyoung leads the effort to rescue him. Jung-soo finds fellow survivor Mina and her little dog.I was expecting Daylight for some reason and it bothered me that he didn't seem to be trying to dig himself out for a long time. Then he finds Mina and her little dog. It's when he's struggling with the water that I fully committed to the movie. This is not a hero. It helps to have the great Bae Doo-na as the desperate wife. She does the heavy emotional lifting. I could do without the happy ending and a sadder rescue with only the dog would be more compelling. He marks the days on the wall which could show that he almost made it out. That would be the sad ending that this movie deserves.", "Too long...and unnecessary quirkness in a supposedly disaster movie! Also why did he get back with his wife?! She is the one who made the choice to let him die. He was a fool to get back with her in the end. Dumb writing!", "Hard to watch. Raises many moral dilemmas, but there is one clear point: there is a need for both regulation and enforcement. The absence of either one lines the pockets of the capitalists with blood money.", "The weight of a human life outweighs the earth. (And a pretty cute pug, too.) I really loved this film. I'm a big fan of Korean cinema and disaster films in general, so this one hit all the right notes for me. My only complaint is that it was probably longer than it needed to be, but it's still worth the time!", "Another decent Korean offering, Tunnel is worth taking in if you're tired of Hollywood productions and you'd like to take in something different. Recommended.", "Given my love and admiration of the Asian cinema, then of course I jumped at the chance to get to sit down to watch the South Korean movie \"Tunnel\" (aka \"Teo-neol\"). I had not even heard about it prior to getting the chance to sit down and watch it, nor did I read the synopsis. It is South Korean, and that is reason enough to give it a chance.\"Tunnel\" was an adequate disaster movie, although it was somewhat of a different approach on a disaster movie. It is not your usual large scale end-of-the-world type of disaster movie, but instead a personal one that followed the horrible events of one person.The effects in the movie were good, and were realistic. And the effects definitely added to the sense of it feeling real and claustrophobic.Now, the cast in \"Tunnel\" was quite limited, which added pressure on the individual actors and actresses to perform to carry the movie. And I will say that the performers in the movie definitely lived up to their jobs and did good jobs in bringing their characters to life on the screen.\"Tunnel\" felt somewhat long, as the movie ran for more than two hours. It would have benefitted tremendously if they had been more thorough in the editing room and cutting the movie down to about an hour and a half instead. Some parts just felt tedious and were little more than just fillers.However, unlike many of the multi-million dollar Hollywood disaster movies with bedazzling special effects, then \"Tunnel\" is not the type of movie that you can watch again and again.", "That's a good suspense movie, and it's not recommended for claustrophobic persons. The audiences have to be warned with this one. But there are a few things which are a bit corny. For instance, how the hell can anyone survive more than three weeks buried underground with only two little bottles of water, which he shares with another victim? And how can he survive during the same period with an electric torch containing ordinary batteries? And when the female survivor asks him to call her mother, because her own cell phone is broken, he doesn't even dial the the mother in question's phone number...And when the rescue crew drills in the wrong place, that doesn't prevent them to finally find him just afterwards...OK, that remains a very tense suspense movie"], "265": ["Absolutely adorable show, sad it is finished but the growth of all the characters throughout made this utterly believable and the couples were just so sweet together.

However, it didn't progress as good as expected. The first episodes were really good, with the romance developing in slow tempo and the drama being highlighted with the struggles of the inspiring students who want to debut as a band. However, the drama started falling apart after the first half. The romance was not as strong, as the guy constantly made the girl cry, and the girl simply and very idiotically, for me at least, kept coming back. There as a nice love triangle, that, again, couldn't be developed because clearly the girl was obsessed over her first love interest. The performances were okay, but not as good as they could have been, and the songs were nice.

Believing that she is ill, she thinks that she has three months to live. On top of that, she gets finally hired. The drama follows the principle of the mean, arrogant male lead and the good hearted but poor girl. The romance here is slow developed, as the drama focuses mainly on the office drama, as well as the girl's and her friends' condition. It was refreshing to watch, as the idea was good and well executed. The conclusion didn't come in the first few episodes, but it kept the interest high throughout the drama.

Even if you're not usually into family dramas, I really do think you might like this one.It's engaging and well-paced despite its sprawling cast and multiple narrative arcs, and the characters feel like real people, even when things lean a little treacly at times.I enjoyed almost every character in this show, but my hands-down favorite is Lee Yoo Ri as Hye Young. She is \u2013 in a word \u2013 Awesome. I think I didn't even know what I wanted in an awesome female character, until Hye Young exploded onto my screen.In the myriad of romantic relationships in this drama world, the one that stood out to me the most was between Dad and Mum (Kim Young Chul and Kim Hae Sook). Beyond the flush of courtship that their kids went through at various stages of our story, to me, the longstanding affection and care that Dad and Mum had for each other was even more beautiful and moving. I love that in the big and little things, they unfailingly stood by each other, and supported each other, and demonstrated love, care and concern for each other. Even when they disagreed and argued, it was clear that they never stopped caring about each other. If anything, any disagreement they had tended to be rooted in a deep sense of concern for each other. Serious relationship goals, truly. \u2764In this kind of family drama where I know going in, that we're highly likely to get a happy ending all around, it's more important to me how we get to that happy ending, and the nuances around the journey, rather than the happy ending itself.

The show has the usual elements of k-drama: the rich, good looking chaebol; his cold, antagonistic family; the sassy girl; the love triangle; and the boy gets girl story after overcoming difficulties, but it managed to be so much more.The plot: Do Bong Soon (Park Bo Young) is a woman, who's born with superhuman strength. \"The Force\" runs through the female line in her family. It can only be used for good or she can lose her strength forever like her mother did. She loves her father who is a gentle warm character, and her twin brother, Do Bong Ki, who works as a doctor in a hospital. Bong Soon can't find a suitable job, but she wants to be a game developer. There are two other men in her life. One is her childhood friend, Guk Doo, a stern police detective played by Ji Soo. She has a secret crush on him. Also she hides her strength around him, since he claims to have a soft spot for tiny, fragile women, just like Bong Soo seems to be at first sight. The other man is Ahn Min Hyuk (Park Hyung Sik) the lanky, baby-faced CEO of AIN SOFTware, a gaming company. One day he witnesses Bong Soon's superpowers against a group of gangsters, and he hires her to be his personal bodyguard to protect him against a mysterious caller, who has been making death threats against him. At the same time a serial kidnapper starts taking tiny, fragile women off the streets. Guk Doo wants to catch him, Bong Soon comes to his aid. Can she help both men to track down the culprits? The Good: this show is a wonderful blend of slapstick comedy, old fashioned romance and a refreshing look at gender roles. First there's a hidden message in the story, that loving a strong woman makes you a better man. It works that way for ages in the Matriarchy that is the Do Dynasty. Second there's a subplot about the young chaebol, who pretends to be gay. This image helps him with free publicity, protects him against unwanted female attention, and last but not least: keeps his lovely \"Peanut King Kong\" close by his side without alarming her. He even teases her with his supposed attraction to Guk Doo, saying he has a nice butt. His male secretary really seems to be gay, but not out of the closet yet, and the male office manager is openly gay trying to get his dear master into his nail painted clutches. Also the show makes fun of the Korean Patriarchy: the police office, the youth gang, the gangster mob in the neighborhood, and the patriarch of the chaebol's family, they are all absurdly dysfunctional. The Bad: there aren't many flaws IMO, but tastes differ. I find the romance very sweet, but it could be old fashioned and slow paced to others. The slapstick elements, and multiple use of sound effects, are not everyone's cup of tea, but I liked it. See for example the scene with a drunken Bong Soon urging her boss to 'log out', meaning 'to come out' with the sound effect of a computer logging out. Finally I don't like to see the women molester, but I can understand his impact in this drama.So I give Strong Woman Do Bong Soon a 9 out of 10, because I like the story lines, the action, and the actors are well matched.", "I really loved this drama from beginning to end <3 actors have very well played, we felt their emotions through them the scenario is very well written nothing to say except Bravo <3 a wonderful team. being an addict of the dramas that made me happy, it made me laugh and cry every time. so thanks to the actors, the director and the whole team.

From the perfect comic timing to mushy romantic scenes to the hints of thriller and suspense it has it all. The lead pair have crackling chemistry even though when the story is not cliche where you get a docile and submissive female lead. Park bo young is super cute and adorable that you certainly fall in love with her. I felt like crying whenever she cried and laughed when she was all happy go lucky. \nAbout the actor Park hyung sik I just loved him from the start to end. He is funny, cute,hot, emotional and have the power to make women dream about a man like him. The way he looks at Bong-Soon and caresses her in romantic scenes are so gooey and dreamy that you will fall in love with him. His expressions and emotions whenever Bong-soon shows affection towards him are just so so so good that you want to see him even more. I am appreciating it more also because most of the shows doesn't portray the emotions of the male leads so transparently but this show does that and I found it quite amusing.The one thing I did not liked about the show were the side stories and extra humor added by other characters. I had to skip those parts as I found it quite boring and they did not contribute much to the story. I guess the leads were good enough in adding the humor quotient to the show. Instead of those parts i would have really loved to see some more romantic moments of the lead couple.", "Loved this show.

The chemistry between the two leads, Park Bo Yeong and Park Hyung Shik, is so good it is fun just to see them interact. I believe Bo Yeong won a best actress award for this and she is natural, brilliant and adorable, but Hyung Shik is probably the best male actor I've seen in K-drama. Often the players in k-dramas are wooden and the writing stilted, but this story just flows, even with the number of obligatory slow-mo almost-kiss eye-2-eye staring scenes.

It is particularly attractive not only because it watches well as a serious but because it avoids nearly all romance and action tropes that may be expected. The action and drama perfectly balanced against the comedy, and all three of these aspects were well-written and well-performed in their own right. The chemistry between the main characters is tangible and the best I have ever seen on television or in movies. This show will make you laugh and cry.

Starting with the STORY, even though there is alot going in the drama, it has unique plot line. You get to see a different take on super-powers. The female lead, unlike most dramas where they play a somewhat passive role, plays an active role. The characters have a great chemistry and compliment each other. The drama will take you through a lot of emotions as it includes a lot of genres that are somewhat well balanced. It has a great humor (which some people might get butthurt from) and great romance! which will definitely shake your heart. It has a mysterious and criminal side to it, which is not really well written, but can be overlooked as there other great aspects to the drama. Overall, I'd give it a 9.9 and definitely re-watch (a 100%). Another series to for this drama would be interesting.", "JUST WATCH IT! It's excellent and lovely, don't wait a second more before you watch it", "This was my first Korean serie.\nMy first Asian serie was the 2018 Meteor Garden, I fell in love with this serie too and watched Love 020 after that.I saw a lot of short clips of Strong Woman and I felt really attracted to it.I'm a big romanticus and I always melt with love stories.It got me addicted right away, Park Bo Young is a really adorable and funny girl and Park Hyung Shik made my heart melt every scene he laughed, smiled, cried, was funny and loved Do Bong Soon.Their chemistry is so good, I felt my cheeks blushing with every romantic scene. He fell for her almost right away and she had to fall in love with him because she was still in love with policeman Guk Doo.Besides the lovestory I really enjoyed the other storyline, it was really exciting and I couldn't stop watching because I wanted to know what was going to happen in the next episode!This serie is also really funny, there were a lot of funny scenes and I had to laugh out loud, that normally doens't happen to me haha.Strong Woman Do Bong soon has a special place in my heart and was an eye opener for my now discovered love for Asian series. I loved Descendants of the Sun and Something in the Rain. These kind of series makes you want to question your own life and if you finished a serie you don't know what to do with your life ;-)....", "Endearing characters and a smart storyline make this a standout K- Drama. Two leads are magnificent and have perfect chemistry. The supporting cast will have you crying with laughter, terrified and wiping away the tears, sometimes all at once.

The 3 main characters are so unlikable. Do Bong-soon is super-naturally strong but for some reason wants to be weak like a normal person because somehow that would make her life better? Kind of a like a rich person thinking if they are poor, people will like them for their real selves or something ridiculous. I mean she can hide her powers so I'm not sure what her problem is. Oh wait. She's stupid. Her brother got all the brains. How did she think she is qualify to work in a software company based on one drawing? Even Ahn Min-hyuk mocks her by giving her a kids desk.Not sure what Ahn Min-hyuk sees in her except she is super-strong because everybody else knows her brother inherit the book and possibly street smarts. He literally says this in the first episode. Also Ahn Min-hyuk thinks he needs protection but only hires 1 unqualified person to do it instead of a whole team of professionals? Of course, he cheaps out when they can use some real help.In Guk-doo probably ruined more cases than he solved. Trying to beat a confession out of a suspect is so 80's. Also, in 13 episodes, the only time adult In Guk-doo smiles is to a shop girl. No wonder he lost his girlfriend. He's totally riding on his smiling when he was in high school. When did he and Do Bong-soon ever go out as friends for a coffee or dinner? He just like yelling at her like an overprotective dad. Jeez.The side story with the gangster was the highlight of the show.Thank you", "I was waiting for the leading lady's comeback since oh my ghost. And though the beginning of this drama was a killer, the ending lost most of its charm and ended up a cheesy rom com. Thankfully, there was the serial killer case that at least kept it refreshing and interesting. Honestly, the main idea of a girl having the super power of strength kind of scared me off this drama, especially after having watched weight lifting fairy straight before it (felt like a rip off). However, I gave in and watched the first episode and I was immediately hooked. The girl was very cute, the guy funny, the second lead interesting and the serial killer case thrilling. That was until they became a couple. The drama shifted its attention from the girl's powers and quest of justice to the development of the romance. Okay, the couple was cute together, but some more twists on the criminal case would have been nice. One other thing that bothered me about this drama was the constant advertisements. Most of the dramas do it smoothly and some of them even hide them so good that you can't tell if they are promoting a product or not. But this one just had some unnecessary scenes simply for the purpose of advertising. If that had happened once or twice, it would have been tolerated, but there were scenes in most of the episodes. So, 6 out of 10.", "I only made it through the first few episodes. They stuffed sophisticated rom-com, spooky special powers, horror flick evil kidnapper with overtones of sexual perversion, buffoonishly bad slapstick, corrupt police and whatever else was in there into the same series.They did it badly. It didn't work for me. The heroine with the superpowers spent way too much of her time looking helplessly cute and befuddled, a victim of badly contrived circumstances. One would expect a young woman of 27, with superhuman strength, from a family of women with similar powers, to be more than dithering ditz. Perhaps it develops in the later episodes, but it wasn't worth taking the time to see if it got better. Her one good scene was the job negotiation scene, but after that flash of spirit she regressed to a befuddled clueless fool. Speaking of clothes - the expected stylishness of the characters was, as usual in K-drama, excellent.", "I'm giving it a 7 purely for the kidnapping/thriller story. Everything else in this drama I could do without. If it wasn't for sheer police incompetency you would have thought it would have been solved rather quickly - but I guess they had to drag it out for the sake of the show - the show certainly wouldn't have kept me interested in anything else that was going on. Some of the sub-plots are, while trying to add humor, quite bizarre. Not to mention there are many very unlikable characters - some of them are the main ones. There seemed to be a jolting inconsistency too in the relationship between the two lead male characters. They seemed to be getting along and working together in crucial moments and then out of nowhere they hated each other again. Weird. Anyway, I give it a 7 for the cat & mouse between the criminal & police/Bong Soon.", "I just get into K-Drama and watched Goblin Guradian The Lonely and Great God, wrong start because, with all its weakness, particularly illogical character (how a 1000 years old warlord behave as teenager and such), it was amazing.This next drama I'm looked forward with had high hope since it's got similar high rating, turned out to be a turkey.Bad and stupid plot. To be honest, it started pretty well, get boring pretty fast, the rest are pretty stupid, dumb cliched without redemption."], "274": [], "275": ["The second part of the series does not follow the same story line as the first one, Universe's star, though the fantasy element is all over it. The story is about a guy who, having broken up with his girlfriend, having failed his exams again and having been kicked out of his house, takes part in testing a new drug. The side effects, however, changed him into a kind of super man. The story was nice and kind of funny, with the guy who has been a loser for most of his life finally getting what he wanted from life. However, the romance was kind of weak, though it got better towards the end. Surely, the ending was way better than the one in Universe's star, as it had a closure and a satisfying conclusion.

It will take you from one extreme to the other, most of the series you will ask ''Why can't they just say something'' . Just like in real life, people always want to protect their loved ones.

I recommend this series 10 out of 10.", "The story of a time traveller's wife isn't something new. And yet, this drama manages to keep the interest high throughout the sixteen episodes. The drama starts kind of odd, with the guy meeting with the girl, and saving her from an accident. We then discover slowly his secret and her past. Sure, they get married very quickly, so if you're looking for a slow built romance, maybe this one isn't for you. The drama focuses more on the mysteries of the future, on the bad guy in the office and on trying to figure out how to change one's fate. The performances, moreover, were really good and the side stories, even though they were few and had only a few minutes airing time, were cute and entertaining. So, 8 out of 10, only because some things were left unexplained, but the twist in the end was amazing.", "I'm glad I watched this. Ma Rin was so relatable in every way. She was plain and just normal. But in a heart-warming way. I could get her. And seo joon was protective and kind.I could understand his confusion, his worries and affections. . The story was well paced. The theme music was really perfect. It's really simple but yet it talks to you. It makes you feel something. I don't know how to put it. it may sound strange but this drama feels like very early in the morning.", "A potent theme/subject/topic of time travel poorly executed through a feeble plot line (with lots of plot holes) and very confusing and unhelpful editing. Without giving too much away, I'd say that no amount of time travel will give anyone ability to play God in order to prevent simple human stupidity. Something that most kids recognize all over the world - not to run on to a busy road- seems the main reason in the plot at the end in the series; The lead female character, aged 30+, runs on to the middle of a very busy 6-lane road junction to retrieve a paper marriage registration certificate, knocked out and blown away by a passer-by. If it's that important why wasn't it tucked away safe inside a folder rather than being waved around while held in hand, and even if it gets lost, it is a paper document after all- a reissue could have been requested later. If that is a plot hole, I've just illustrated one of many. You get my point. Nonetheless, this series (and many others) does make me convinced that if multi-universe theory is true then time travel would be a futile attempt anyway, even if it was made possible. With multitude of time-lines, it would deem sensible to just live your life to the fullest in the time-line that you are in, rather than waste time trying to affect other time-lines with inconsequential outcomes.", "First of all, let me state that I was intrigued by the premise. I've always been a fan of time-travel, whether it be in movies, TV shows or other. I'm not going to rant about errors vis-a-vis the time-travel blah blah blah, or the logistics of it. After all, it's fantasy, and should be accepted as such. So the writers/executives, whoever it was, came up with this great idea for a show. Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there. Someone, in all their wisdom, decides that it must go on for 16 x 1- hour episodes. The problem is that, I get the feeling this decision was made long before the knowledge or guarantee, if you like, that the show actually needed those 16 episodes. So the writers are left with the task of prolonging this fantastic idea to the point where it becomes boring/frustrating/annoying. I can forgive them for the time travel errors, cause that's just fantasy, but the moronic characters and dialogue, this I cannot. I'm also amazed by the technical abilities of mobile phones in South-Korea, apparently, they can pick up dialogue with crisp quality from at least 20 yards away when shooting video. I wonder if writers will ever stray from the 'cliche' of ending an episode on a cliff-hanger, in the vain hope that viewers will just have to watch the next installment. I know, and this may sound radical, but why don't they just concentrate on writing a good script, draw in the viewers, make them sit on the edge of their seat? Not bore them for 55 minutes then throw a spanner in the works in the final 5 minutes like some kind of bait.This could have been fantastic as, let's say, 4 x 1-hour episodes. I'm guessing at this point, because I reached episode 7 and concluded that 2 x 1-hour shows would have sufficed up til now. I won't be watching anymore, I really tried to give it a fair shot. To say I am disappointed would be an understatement of gargantuan proportions. I've watched other Korean shows (My girlfriend is a gumiho , My love from the star , Master's sun, oh my Venus etc) and found them all to be very enjoyable, or at least, made me watch til the end. As for this festering refuse, I will never know how it ends, and it's something that doesn't bother me at all, I'm just upset that it's taken me 7 episodes to realise that I was wasting my time.", "It is the best drama i have seen in 2017 after goblin.this makes you laugh, cry, think and love.The love chemistry between the two main leads will make your heart melts.

I'll try my best not to be biased ;)This drama is undoubtedly the best short drama I've ever watch alongside with Splash Splash Love (they are directed and written by the same person, Kim Ji Hyun). At first, I watch this because I know Suho, and I think it will be just the same typically story-written drama that I have watched. First of all, the casts are perfect and I especially love the girl main character. She can deliver her emotions so well, and I'm surprised because I haven't seen her drama/films before (maybe she's not famous). And I love her expression, it's natural and not forced. A rare thing in drama world. Second, the storyline\u200b is so well-written. I keep questioning what happened and what will happen while watching this drama, and I found myself in awe as the story unfolds. And they're not leaving e-ve-ry sing-le detail. Third, it's a fantasy drama but it feels realistic! Why? Because the story writer makes it so that it feels realistic. For an example, a die-hard fans can really relate to the girls main character (grim reaper), right? Fourth, the soundtrack choices in this drama is on point. It's not cheesy and distracting (sometimes people will remember the ost more than the scene because it's playing excessively).\u200b These soundtrack also helps to deliver the emotions. Overall it's a very touching drama, and it has many life lessons in it. For you who haven't watched this drama, what are you waiting for? :)ps. I cried like a little baby while watching this", "A mini drama part of a bigger project, that started really strong, but failed to give a satisfying ending.

During the process she interferes with life and death matters and is sent back to life with a number of wishes she can use in order to save the singer. However, when the wishes are finished, she has to return back to the unliving. So, the first episodes were really good. They were funny and cute and the romance was exiting. Towards the middle, the romance started to develop, and it was a nice romantic story, but the ending was really confusing, at least for me, and felt like they were wrapping things up for the next story. I wish they had explained what happened more. Also, the jump forward seven years later didn't felt like it, and, honestly, it was like some of the chemistry between the couple vanished.

Financial and administrative corruption in big companies is the main point and nicely showed.", "I don't usually like Korean shows. Overacting, clich\u00e9s and incredibly lazy writing almost always plagues the shows. But this show changed my mind about it. It does fall into some of the usual lazy writing you've come to be disappointed from Asian cinema but it boasts a colourful cast of individuals with separate story lines and can surprisingly manage to balance the comedy with a bit of drama without taking itself too seriously or falling into incredibly unbelievable or convoluted plot lines.

Thumbs up!", "Not typical romance kdrama.. but it's the reality behind business, justice, and so on.", "I will be strict on this one, as many told me that it was a seriously good drama. And, judging from the ratings it had for each episode, apparently a lot of viewers actually enjoyed this drama.

The plot was kind of boring, with the twists being obvious and the romance seriously weak, although, if I'm not wrong on this one, the conclusion of the love triangle was unexpected. In addition, the soundtrack of this drama started getting annoying after the fiftieth time you would listen to the same song over and over again!

It's like while one side is pulling the rope and the other side is pulling too. There was no guess of who would win in the earlier episodes. As show went, it got interesting more and more. No stretching of episodes that much. But they extended two more episodes because of amazingly high ratings. Still, the show fits everything they have stated earlier.

All change when the sister of his former secretary joins his team aiming to get revenge for her sister's death. So, the girl was simply annoying at the first episodes, always sticking her nose where she shouldn't and creating trouble. Plus, everyone in the drama treated the shy boss like he was a criminal. Basically, the drama bullied it's lead male till he had hit rock bottom. Things picked up when the script changed and we got a better idea about the mystery regarding the death of the secretary. Plus, the relations in the office got better, as the guy started interacting more with his team, and the later started to understand him. And even though the girl's character was improved, the second male lead got seriously unlikable.

The romance is cute and all the characters are very entertaining, with strong personalities (even the small side characters manage to be easy to remember). Anyway... because I'm too lazy to write a long review I'm just going to say that I recommend this to those that can get into a pretty long story (the episodes are 1h long and A LOT of things happen all the time) with a bit of interesting debates on ethics (and law).", "I love this drama!

The driver who hit the car, actually aimed at killing both father and child, however the main actress was present and even though she was intimidated into not going to court to testify whether the accident was no accident, she did go.

An heiress, only child who survives after the murder of her parents, is able to remember details from robbery and arson after 10 years... The boy/man, from what she remembers, has a distinctive scar on his back. She goes around hiring male models to sit for sketching, but mainly just to get their shirts off. She finds the guy, who is now a sincere (and hot looking) firefighter and contacts the police officer in charge of her parents' murder case.

The big spoiler is rather obvious, and by the 2nd (or was it 3rd) episode, the viewers are in on that detail.

That is not to minimize the South Korean expertise that created it, but simply to avoid the sometimes- backhanded compliment of \"great...for a KDrama.\" It's just great TV, full stop.I've watched KDramas for about a decade, and this one is the best I've seen. Highly recommended, not just for drama fans, but for all fans of quality cinematic art around the world.", "Goblin is by far one of the best Korean dramas in recent years and this can be seen from its record breaking ratings for a cable TV channel. Goblin,also known as Dokkaebi, is a drama with the main themes of fantasy,romance and melodrama with a tinge of action and comedy. It is about a Goblin called Kim Shin and a nameless Grim Reaper who are connected to each other by their past without them knowing at the start. Other main characters include Ji Eun Tak who is the Goblin's bride, Yu Deok Hwa, and Sunny who is the Grim Reaper's love interest.Despite some parts being lengthy and bland, it was needed as the viewers have to know the background story between the main characters in their past lives. The story is a beautiful and heartwarming one where sacrifices have to be made like how Eun Tak must pull out the sword in Kim Shin's chest in order to save herself but kill Kim Shin in the process. In the end, it was Kim Shin who forced Eun Tak to pull out the sword due to a dangerous situation(See Ep 13) and as a result, he managed to save Eun Tak by sacrificing himself.Besides the main story, there is also the story between the Grim Reaper and Sunny and the interaction between the two of them is often amusing and funny. The \"bromance\" between the Grim Reaper and Goblin is also worth noting as it highlights the impressive chemistry between the two.Bottom line: Goblin is a must-watch for all Kdrama starters as it has all the ingredients for a good drama. There's a reason why it's rated 9.0 by IMDb.", "I was really hesitant to watch this at first because I'm not really into fantasy stories but since it's gong yoo I gave it a shot and boy did I tell you I regret it? This is so good that I could re-watch it again if it wasn't for the long list of other K-dramas I must watch. Grim reaper and goblin's bromance is undeniably adorable. Kim go-eun's acting is perfect I cried with her.", "This is just pure awesome all the way. I mean honestly, it's unbelievable how good this is. I only have minor gripes with product placements, but it's not too serious & without them they couldn't have financed the drama. Pretty much everything is perfection, flawless casting, flawless acting , amazing story, some of the most epic & most emotional moments in TV history.\n There was that moment when Eun Tak talked about what a great day she had, I don't recall I have ever felt like that watching a TV show or anything else on the big screen really.\nThe OST is out of this world good too, it really helps with the feels.", "I cried, laughed and loved! Must watch! Definitely miss this show!!", "This unusual tale of a supernatural Guardian from the past and a young human woman who is destined to be his savior is haunting and beautiful.

I would recommend this to anyone looking for something different and unusual yet captivating.", "I would learn to read & write another language just to be able to understand all the nuances I'm sure I missed - although subtitles.

Everything is just amazing!\n100% recommend.", "I almost want to give it 10/10 but... nothing is ever perfect, although Goblin is very close to be perfection. This k-drama is, in my opinion, one of the best. First of all, its originality as well as the mix of genre (historical, drama, romance, thriller and fantasy) is absolutely incredible. Characters are really charming, and you'll appreciate every facets of their relationships, whether romantic or friendship. They're so likable that you just end up feeling like they're your friends too... which inevitably lead to you feeling all kind of emotions if you are the empathetic type. I ended up bawling my eyes out and laughing my a** off with them. Cinematography is incredible as well. Everything in this k-drama is beautiful, from the images to the soundtrack (seriously, one of the best in my opinion).\nI don't have any negative comments. I changed my mind I put 10/10.", "Simply amazing. The picturesque cinematography, the soundtrack, the full packed and unpredictable storyline was breathtaking to watch. The drama gave great aesthetic pleasure and the dialogue was beautiful. 'Because the weather was good, because the weather was bad, and because the weather was good enough. I loved every moment of it.\" The goblin who stays by your side, the bride who loves and remembers him, the days I spent watching Goblin were the happiest.", "Rarely do I come across a show that I immediately want to watch a second time - right after I finish it the first time. This is one of those rare shows. The story line makes you laugh and cry in equal measures, and the chemistry between the characters is great. And if you've never ventured into the K-drama world, this is definitely a standout.", "After DOTS, Goblin finally took the title of most popular drama. And it's true that everyone talks about this drama. In my opinion, that because of two things: the OST and the cinematography. The soundtrack was really good and the songs as atmospheric as they should be, creating the right mood for every scene. Then, the cinematography was amazing, with the first episode introducing breathtaking shots of battles and palaces. The great cinematography continues on to the rest of the episodes as well, aiding when the drama hit standstills. In addition the theme is very original, as the plot wasn't clearly introduced to the audience, making you curious to want to see what's the buzz about this drama. Well, the story is very fairy tale like, a man is turned into a goblin and he is waiting for centuries to find the girl who will be destined to be his \"bride\", which will also mean that she will be able to pull the sword out of his body and kill him. Meanwhile, a grim ripper moves into his house and he falls in love with a human. And here is where it becomes complicated, as the concepts of reincarnation and four lives are introduced. Fortunately, they are clearly explained, so one can't easily be confused. Now, about the negatives: -the duration was way too long and that led to countless flashbacks to be thrown into each episode to make it longer. -the romance was a little blunt. The performances were great, and the second romantic story was really good, with the chemistry between the couple obvious. Maybe it was the age difference of the main couple (the girl was still in school) or the fact that the girl didn't actually treat the idea of being the goblin bride seriously; more like she used it as means to survive. It got better towards the end, fortunately, but till then it was awkward. -the main story could have been better presented -the ending was weak -the advertisements were too many!! Other than that, it was an enjoyable drama (still too long though!) and the side stories were the best of it. So, 5 out of 10.", "Funny, touching, sometimes tragic but always turning back on itself--it is romantic; well-written and directed with a terrific cast of some of the best Korean actors. It is a wonderful story filled with humor, pathos, tension, romance, and themes of retribution, compassion, and forgiveness; true love, friendship, and great joy. K-Drama got it right on this one from its gripping introduction to a beautiful, satisfying conclusion. It is an amazing series--a fine accomplishment in theme, style, and vision.", "The best show ever in Fantasy genre. Every scene in this drama is a masterpiece.", "I LOVED THE SHOW FROM THE START BUT FOR ME THE ENDING WAS SO FRUSTRATING! Like why did the goblin have to wait for 9 more years?!! Why did he not get the peace he was promised? Why did Ji-Eun Tak have to die?? Weren't 900 years enough that you make goblin wait for his bride to be born again?", "I've been hooked by kdrama for 14 years and this one hold the top position. I've watched it 3 times already.

Take what is basically a fairy tale, plop in into modern time and proceed to capture us with all of the magic. The cinematography, the music and acting were all top notch.

My expectation becomes higher, The story is strong and interesting.. Ep2 is still good.. but after that?? I don't understand how come this show become a teenager love story and the goblin suddenly act out of his character, he was a cold blooded general who has killed so many people in the past then now he act silly in front of a teenager? I will be glad if it had more fight scenes, more complicated story plot, more goblin enemies.. as shown from the first episode.. I feel cheated.. my heart is stabbed with goblin's sword!so weird, might as well erase the whole 1st and 2nd episodes. It seems that he as a goblin who was a general is only a decoration to bait me for watching this show. Anyway, i have thrown all of my expectation for this show and only watch this for it's comedy and nice bromance with the grim reaper..But it seems goblin silly character is not really a BIG ISSUE for me to continue. I tried to continue watching yesterday, episode 6, but i really cannot stand of eun tak character anymore, yes, she is a high school teenager, but since she does not have family and been abused by her aunt's family, i don't know why she acts childish like that. She has been cooking and taking care of her aunt's family, she should be more independent & have more dignity, but in ep 6 she was like asking goblin for a big house etc for her, i was like errr..? She always ask money from kim shin and it's kinda annoyed me lol, she seems blackmail kim shin to give her money and house so that she will pull out the sword for him.. I don't even remember that i asked money from stranger, i don't even ask money from my parents, i feel to ashamed to do that. oh well, i view it like that, so i decided to drop the show :P This show really teach young female teenager to ask money from sugar daddy.

She is lucky to have a good editor and stellar cast to bring in the rating but her writing is weird for me.", "Goblin is a well-shot, stylish and artistic drama with some great locations. In addition to the cinematography, the soundtrack is also good and the plot is interesting. Despite a few extremely silly scenes, I enjoyed the bromance between the Goblin and the Grim reaper. That said, the female lead and the plot holes somewhat let it down. Although I did not hate Kim Go-eun, her character was not well-written and her inconsistent acting made it worse. Yoo In-na, the supporting actress, in contrast was impressive in her role and uplifted the drama. I also enjoyed the Grim reaper's romance more than the Goblin's. The ending was a bit incomplete and did not completely do justice to all the sub-plots.

There is humour, romance, action, fantasy and above all ample amount of emotions. This drama is surely gonna leave one teary eyed by the time it ends. This drama is one helluva rollercoaster ride of sadness and happiness. Every actor performed their role to the fullest. I just wish that the lead actors once again come together for yet another drama having such emotional depth. You won't regret watching this.I guarantee it.", "Goblin comes with the usual features of Korean romances set in a modern setting. Expect a consistent display of product placements (not always elegantly woven into the story) and the per usual fascination with materialism (high end goods, hot young CEOs and beef\u0085 for some reason) that rings a bit false with the moral message that love is true and money doesn't matter. But that aside, it is a heart warming story in which the loves of two couples are cleverly interwoven with a bromance and elements of fantasy that stays on the right side of cheesy. It takes pain seriously (you will find it hard not to go teary at times; the acting is good and the heartaches come across as sincere), but juxtaposes it well with a flippant and light-hearted humour. A few exchanges become lost in translation, presumably due to being specific to the Korean culture and not translating well outside of it. There are also a few episodes halfway through that drags. But it is worth staying with it to the end. A very sweet and entertaining tale. Put it on the list.", "This show is so slow, overrated and just plain bad!

The drama started off as quite an interesting story - the con man's tricks, intrigues, crimes, getting-aways etc. adding a lot of tempo and suspense. But only in the first 5-6 episodes. Then everything slowed down badly.2. Some physiological moments in the beginning were well portrayed, eg.: - the mermaid following a man who does not even remember her, or trying to adapt to the world like learning to eat, etc. Was a promising beginning.What was bad:1. after 6 episode the drama slowed down badly, lost momentum, was dragging on and on. 2. it felt like in the middle of the shooting the producers decided t target a different audience - high school girls. here the drama began to lose on its maturity, slipping into nonsense cheesiness. Also It felt like a copycat of romantic scenes looked up in other high-ranking dramas. 3. the ending was extremely disappointing. Of course it had to end well, but possibly, avoiding all the typical romantic clich\u00e9s and poor script logic. Was not intelligent or smart or interesting. Very predictable, have-seen-it already, too wordy.4. The whole film one kept asking oneself - why mermaid? Why so much \"kids book\" magic? It could have been an exciting story if the female lead had some other physical defect or maybe even a weird psychic ability. The drama was unnecessarily \"childishly magical\" making is hard to watch for more mature audience. Can imagine lots of high-school mermaid emogies and stickers, but featuring in leading life style magazines - probably not so much.

Legend of the blue sea is about a mermaid who fells in love with a con man, after meeting him in Spain, and decides to find him in Seoul. However, she had erased his memory beforehand and so he can't remember her. Meanwhile, the drama shows the love story between the two main characters in a different era and how they have now reincarnated into the present lovers. I divide this drama into three parts, the first one which is the interesting one, the second one which is the romantic one and the last one that was kind of boring and more family drama like. The plus points for this drama are the performances, especially from the leading lady. She was really good and funny pretending to be a creature from the sea learning the human behaviour and way of living. The chemistry, however, between the two leads was weak...The family drama was interesting and the step mother\\villain was really the ideal villain type that you want to see behind bars. Of course, when the family drama started progressing, the romance and the mermaid affairs got the second lead. And though it was entertaining, the last few episodes could have been combined into one and that would have made this drama perfect. However, they just prolonged the story by adding constant flash backs again and again which was tiring. So, 6 out of 10.", "After watching My love from Another Star... which was awesome...

Technically, too many instances of different language subtitles superimposed over each other. Poor attention to detail which is needed for a good movie. 2. CGI and modeling of mermaid's tail all the way to the part that it was obviously covering breasts looked cheap, definitely not real (seamlessly no other parts associated with a living creature), and plainly poorly thought out. Another lost attention to detail. 3. Acting was robotic photo-op pretty - attractive actors doing little else than pose for the camera. Dialogue was inane. Nothing likable about characters and their behavior, ethics. 4. Script/story of last mermaid (how?) with makeup (lipstick, etc.) reincarnating on her own with help from a bracelet appearing hundreds of years apart was unimaginative children's tale fantasy. Most of the film is her contemporary adjustment to modern civilization (learning to speak; how glass doors can not be walked through, eating, etc.) which was rom-tragi/com TV series meant to be funny and/or tragic, and finally ends up boringly predictable. 5.

Needless to say that I was programmed to watch this series.Bok Joo is one of the female characters that I came to like right away, in HIGH contrast with the crazy Baek In-Ha which was a bit annoying. Sung-Kyung was a real and wonderful surprise in this simple character about a weight lifting athlete who is supposed to be \"big\" and not so pretty. Jung Joon-Hyung is the swimmer who recognizes her (actually her first love) and becomes very close to her in a friendly way. What happens after is the best.A beautiful couple relationship develops after Bok Joo has her a broken heart after her first crush. And this is where the bar for a boyfriend raises to a new level. Joon Hyung becomes the dream boyfriend any woman should aim for. All their scenes together look so natural and yes, that look that Bok Joo receives will be always remembered. The rest is also naive and sweet. Such a massive change from the all violence/sex/boring US shows. I've laughed like I haven't done in years of US/European shows. And probably I've re-discovered the tenderness a TV program can portray (with other values as friendship, family value, commitment to achieve a goal, overcoming obstacles) without the need to use all the clich\u00e9s I've mentioned.Watch it and relax, you'll come to treasure this couple.", "This is one of the best rom-com Kdramas in 2016.

Unlike in most Korean dramas where the plot makes a twist in the last 1-2 episode, this drama gradually develops to a predictable, yet well-suited ending.The drama tries to portray real hardships and situations faced by athletes who are majoring various sports like weightlifting, swimming and gymnastics in Sports Universities.

The chemistry between them was amazingly powerful, even though their romance didn't start till probably the tenth episode. But even so, the dynamics were great! Cute and romantic, they were the it couple!! The story is nice too: a girl, who's a weightlifter, falls for a doctor who owns a weight lose clinic. In order to be close to him, she signs up for a weight control program in his clinic, but lies about her college major, as well as lying to her fellow students, family, friends and her trainers.

One thing that maybe wasn't that good, was that the leading lady supposed to be overweight, or at least not skinny to be able to do weightlifting, but the drama only had her wearing buggy clothes and she not even looked strong enough.

Her mother had died a few months ago, and the woman hadn't visited the place for some years. But she is surprised to find a young man (younger than her) living in the house. Moreover, she is more surprised to find that the man calls himself her father, having married her mother without telling her, and now demanding from her to treat him like her father as well. The story proceeds as the woman struggles to accept him as her father and she starts to discover alarming evidence about his past life. That's the first part. The second half, however, gets a little tiring and boring. The twists are obvious and not interesting, the love triangle is seriously weak and the romance gets a little held back by so many events and eventually, loses its power and gets boring as well. Other than that, the drama as a whole was funny, especially the times when the guy acted like an old man, had some interesting parts and the performances were good, though I would have preferred the leading lady to have acted more active when pretending to be happy (she smiled, but her eyes were boring).

The drama has flaws of course but it is very entertaining at least to me. A mercenary soldier was framed for the murder of civilians or his own girlfriend and he was on the run. Later he would be joining to the bodyguards team of one of the president candidate family then he would be called Kim Jeha or the code name K2. There he got a job to watch over the candidate secret daughter who could ruin the candidate career if she is made known to the public as his daughter.Go Anna was a secret daughter of the president canditate with a famous actress who died and not with his legal wife Choi Yoo Jin who is one of the main villain of our story. One thing is that she really is ambitious to make her family stronger by making her husband a president. She also kept Go Anna as her victim by not letting her see the father and very manipulating with the girl's mind. She could kill anyone who she think will come into her way. Many people are drawn by this character. The actress playing role is really great. Choi Yoo Jin has reasons for her to become evil. She has soft spot for Kim Jeha since he saved her life though she ordered him get killed at first. Jeha joined her side only they had one enemy or the competent another candidate who got Jeha framed for murder. Jeha was a compassionate upright guy who pity the weak or someone who does not have much power. He pity Go Anna for being the victim of her stepmother and her own father. She was all alone like him to which lead him to fall in love with her i think. They both have childlike behavior too as seen in episode 5 when he was looking at her eating ramen and dance happily from CCTV. Jeha is very protective of her and she depends on him quite a lot. She dislike her stepmother for keeping her like this and think she also killed her own mother. In the middle of drama the Choi Yoo Jin's half brother try to make her want to revenge against his sister since he hates his sister and want to be more powerful. Anna give in to him for a time. But at the end of day the it was not the revenge she actually want. She is just finding herself and her past. She really depend on Jeha and care for him most since he is most concern with her being. Although he is fierce fighter, jeha is so smitten with her. They were just breath of fresh air in this dark drama. One more thing i do not think Anna was a weak character but a strong one because we see she try to run away from her own situation to find her father who she long for; who she think loves her and she loves. But she got the warmness she long for from Jeha instead. She might be stupid at a time but i think she is very brave in her situation. As for Choi Yoo Jin, her power come from her family. She is destined to be evil. Her father was a ruthless man just like how she became. She was competing with her relatives who hates her. She got a good_for_nothing husband who cheats on her. So yep she become a selfish villain. Yet she was very fond of Jeha; not in a romantic way. She was fond of him for his humanity and bravery and being a super hero. But it was too late for her to become good. I was so into these three characters. The political plots were good too. The only problem is that we do not learn Kim Jeha's background very much which i pretty much want to know.for examples like who his parents were and who is he really. I took one point off for this. But the ending was very satisfying still.", "This drama is said to be as good as the Healer (another action spy drama), filled with action scenes, martial arts conflicts, political twists and some romance. The story starts really well, with a solid mystery and wonderful sequences of Barcelona and other Gothic background. The film makers were generous with the amount of blood and fighting they packed the first episodes. The action continues till the very end, which was really strong, leaving an impact, as it didn't conform with the clich\u00e9 happy ever after. Another thing that I liked about this drama was that it portrayed each character in depth and presented everyone's motives and background, even emotions. In addition the performances were excellent, even from the second lead lady that, I admit, I didn't expect her to be that good. However, for me, the romance was a little weak, stuck between the twists and the action scenes, being only there to give motivation to the characters to act and go beyond the human limits. So, 7 out of 10.", "Firstly, my introduction kind long please patient with me. After watching about 10 episode. i felt wish to write a review this Korean TV hit drama 2016. This drama kind like combine \"The bodyguard from Beijing(movie)\" + \"Snow white and 7 dwarf\" . Adding, this drama can say an alternate version Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton Politic life. Something like that. For the beginner part kind confuse to those elderly people but those youngster catch up fast. Yes i get it. Even my parent watch don't have any clue what they are watching. Those people got read review and some don't. My father guess correct about some part about this drama. Why i called alternate version \"Snow White and 7 dwarfs \"? This drama got same stepmother with powerful witchcraft as for the drama got stepmother got powerful security company help supporting running for her husband president election. Adding dwarfs are represent the bodyguards. Kind like make sense. This Korean drama got best actress but she is a member group called \"Girl Generation\". She really an angel. In the end worth watching and continue of adrenaline rush and heart pumping and romance.", "This series seem to be totally unrealistic and out of scenario. The idea is not so bad, but the slogan of the American 80s series where the bad guys are really bad, and the good guys are really good doesn't bring me any value.It seems in the Korean lifestyle the corporations have the vision of \"God-like\" creatures able to invest, create and use unlimited amount of money, resources, people and etc.If you like films where the main character is being \"brought back from the void\" and 30 mins later kicks asses - then you may actually enjoy this crap. However it is not something I'm particularly thrilled about.I don't want to talk to much, but if I would have done this - it would have been is similar spirit... I'm sure you'll get the point! ;)", "This show is so annoying I registered an account just to tell you how bad it is. **spoilers throughout** Without a doubt, the worst thing that occurs in this entire show is the dancing-with-joy-for-having-found-a-pack-of-ramen-noodles in slow-mo scene, which lasts at least 1-2 minutes and has romantic background music while the male lead stares at her like he's falling in love. What else is wrong with this scene? Well, the girl is so emaciated it is hardly believable that if she ever eats ramen that she keeps it down. Her clothes don't stop you from seeing her bare bones poking out now and then throughout the series. The acting is so bad, especially while dancing with ramen that you feel like fingernails are scraping out the inside of your brain, it's that painful. Thankfully, streaming allows you to skip a lot by jumping ahead. Oh, right, another thing I had to skip a lot: the fight-porn in the first several episodes. Antagonizingly long fight scenes that reminded me of 80's movies. Ugh. True bad-ass fighters don't take that long to take out a bunch of guys, so it just doesn't work. Oh, and let's not forget the 50-naked-guys-in-a-communal-shower fight scene, which also lasted a long time. Skip. Skip. Skip. I know right? And I actually like guys. Didn't anyone ask \"what is the point of this scene being so long?\" Shaky cam throughout. Even when totally inappropriate. Yeah, film-makers snobbily call it \"found footage\" like that makes it more classy, but it's still annoying as hell when not used properly. There were a couple of times it was giving me a headache and I had to look away or skip ahead. Contrived. That style of camera work is best when it fits the action or adds something to the scene. Genre switching like nobody's business. Usually this is a political action thriller type of show, but once in a while they forced the actors to act like they were in a romantic comedy and then there would be cheesy romantic comedy music that didn't fit in AT ALL - and so makes you want to vomit. The characters in those moments had to act so inconsistent to their character from the rest of the show that I felt bad for them. The romance wasn't believable either at all. I don't think that girl is very good, specifically. Except when she's yelling and screaming at people. She seems good at that. The cutesy romantic parts felt like a plot device that the director didn't have the slightest idea how to deal with. Okay, so there's this Snow White theme going on with an evil stepmother mastermind and a magic mirror, which is a little sci-fi/fantasy, so felt like it was bending the genre a bit as well. However, the evil stepmother character was really well played and pretty interesting. She was so good it made me wish they had just eliminated the female love interest, who was terrible, and just let the evil stepmother carry it. The only reason I'm giving this a 5 and not a zero is because the stepmother subplot was so entertaining and believable. Unfortunately, most of the side characters were really well acted and believable, but the female love interest was bad enough, shallow enough, superficial enough to ruin the show, and the male lead appears to have been forced to do some shitty scenes on that account. His acting is great when that stupid girl isn't around. :P - Also, you have to suck at making TV shows to make that guy look stupid. Because he is super cute. After the first several episodes they seem to have some of their bad directorial choices put in check as the fight-porn gets minimized somewhat or is better incorporated with the story later. There's still some painfully superficial romantic scenes throughout that are not believable. Like - oh, right, when the female love interest is dying from allergic shock and it's this big tense moment of trying to save her and - oh - the guy has to give her some mouth to mouth because she stops breathing - what do you think is most appropriate? None other than trashy romance music exploding out of nowhere, because a girl dying is soooooo sexy. That was probably the most insulting thing I had to watch as a viewer. Really? Someone thinks it's trashy-romance-sexy when someone is unconscious and dying. F.U. Look though, if you really want to check out this show, a few episodes of Healer will wash that taste right out of your mouth when you're done. No problem.", "The writer totally screwed up the show. I feel bad for the actors. A complete waste of great actors Song Yoon Ah and Ji Chang Wook who unsuccessfully tried to float the show as much as they could with their acting but there is only so much that one can do if the plot and character development is so bad. It's only because of these two I am rating it 3, it doesn't even deserve that much otherwise. The lead character played by Im YoonA is supposed to be innocent and childlike but because of her lacking acting skills and bad writing, she comes across as rather dimwitted. The romance between the lead pair appears to be so forced. It would have been better to pair Song Yoon Ah and Ji Chang Wook together as the lead couple.Ji Chang Wook is really good in the action scenes in the show."], "329": ["Shopping King Louis is a surprisingly good drama. Not the best of course, but it is better than those silly romantic comedies that have no plot and no interest. But let's start with the story: Louis, a spoiled heir of a big shopping company, who has a shopping addiction, returns to Korea to take over his grandmother's company. However, on his way, he has an accident and he looses his memory. Fortunately, a girl, who has come to Seoul to find her younger brother, finds Louis, who wears her brother's clothes, and she agrees to take him in until he remembers something that can help her find her brother. Apart from the first episode, that was just silly and almost made me drop this drama, the rest of the drama was a delight. Louis was childish and hilarious, and the actor who portrayed him did an amazing job (probably his best performance for me, so far). The rest of the cast did an okay job with their characters as well. The romance was sweet, though the chemistry wasn't all there. But, strangely, the pair seemed good together, though he was a little too childish. Some parts of the story were idiotic, but I enjoyed the twists and the main story was very interesting. Plus, the drama was funny, and for me, that was the highlight and the main reason to watch this drama. So 6 out of 10.", "I loved the story, the actors were amazing!\nFrom begin to the and beautiful<3"], "330": ["It's a good drama because shows how unimportant are lots of promises made out or in your mind, how superficial are sometimes the moves of human being in society; after that all things have their own laws, own movement, own chemistry. Like actress Kim Ha Neul knows, another actors and actresses knows well this sort of things, this chemistry, this physics. Don't stunt us but show the inner or hidden laws of love, death and one's action; quite silent laws, strong, inescapable. For mature people I think it is a good, perfect drama. The acting, the script I find to be good, really good. Mrs. Kim Ha Neul, the actors and actresses, plays in concordance with the underlined laws.", "I am so glad to know there are people who agree how bad this drama is. This is created by irresponsible people or situations or maybe by being forced to be created by the influence of money. Whatever it is, a great possible of a storyline that could have happened is totally destroyed because whoever responsible for the storyline dont know a thing about love. I mean yeah affairs happen. Yeah twisty personalities exist. But why add background music that is meant to be played while celebrationss or portraying true love scenario to the totally ugly form of emotion that is formed by betrayal in adultery? Am I missing something here? Yeah I too can come up on ways to accept and agree the storyline, but you and I both know its putting cream on crap. Or have the writers totally lost it?The actors did awesome job, and I like them for it. But this whole script needed only tiny changes to still keep it enjoyable and meaningful, even a drunk reviewer might be able to make that change if he knew the basics of love. morality aside, this is plain stupid. Did they think this will tug the audiences heart more? No, this leeches off undefended psychology of many viewers, while even better result could have been achieved without leeching off of these people. Where is humanity? And what is love? Or has it become plainly and cruely profit oriented? But that doesnt make sense as small changes could have made this drama equally or even more profitable. Or are they that dull? Or is this a satire, parody, or any noir or something? No!! clearly it itself portrays as a love story. which mean this is scripted by irresponsible people who know s*** about love. (sorry, no other way to convey it.)Or has money prevailed responsibility now? But this drama does show a family (su dooh woo's mother) who want value to their life over money. I positively am hopeful that in the next story the scripters write they keep in mind to add some value to the story.Being out of convention is good and keeps it modern, but destroying human personalities by knowingly or unknowingly creating irresponsiblity in audience is considered cruel and a crime (within humanity's jurisdiction).Yeah, plainly, this should have been a story about how their marriages got fixed even though emotional affair possibilies occured. Or atleast show a bit of concern for the kid when their parents split up. But instead, this story falsely portrays happy ending which will by all means is unreal and will be unhappy in real life.And KBS gives a best couple award? Well, the couple they chose are fake to the core, Untrue, and if they were real, they would have been unhappy for many reasons not even considered to portray in this drama. This is, on overall, a very low intelligent drama about an intelligent soceity, but unfortunetly created by professional and talented cast and direction. And somehow everyone agreed to be irresponsible, or were forced to be.Like another reviewer said, this writer shouldnt write anymore. (I dare say, he please become more responsible, and please realize that being responsible too will bring profit.). And I wish people became more responsible with what they participate to create in.Note: I dont know whether this review is going to be reported by the brainwashed fans, but I hope it still remains in the vicinity to help save the minds of atleast a handful of people.", "One of the best Korean drama I've watched so far. The script is very well written. Both the lead actors have done brilliant jobs of conveying their characters. Supporting actors have complemented the story appropriately. I fell in love with the theme song - only you. The first time I saw the drama, I didn't like the way the story moved in the last few episodes. But having seen it the second time, I can now fully appreciate the script writer's perspective. The movie has to be seen within the cultural settings. The direction is so tender and skilfully done. A very complicated social situation has been handled with grace, tenderness and maturity for once without compromising the ending just to appease the audience.", "On the way to the airport didn't seem like a promising drama. It turns out, it wasn't. The performances were okay, but the drama was quite boring. The drama focuses on the story of two strangers who meet after a tragedy. They are both unhappy with their marriages and after the tragedy they bond till they start an affair. Towards the end, the story got very boring and tiring. Maybe that's because the romance wasn't very strong. The couples chemistry was weak, and it was hard to identify with them. The family drama was nice enough, especially the story about Annie's background and the mystery concerning her parents. But, that turned out to be a big flop too. The leading lady was very bleak and with no passion, though the actress seemed to have done her best. Maybe one thing that I have to take from this drama was the way it presented the working woman's position in the society and her struggles to maintain a family and a career, though her background is against it.

The good parts of the drama is the good performances (even from the idols) and the interesting side stories. The characters were very interesting and helped the drama be entertaining till the very end. Avtually, even the last episode, that usually is a boring resume of the story, was okay. Now, for the bad points. I didn't like the beginning and the ending of each episode, as it was a long repeat of the same pattern. If it was for a minute or so, it would have been fine, but it actually lasted for three minutes or so and it was just the same lines over eating scenes. In addition, the romance was just okay.

There are certain clich\u00e9s in every k-drama, including this one, that may look strange to you at first: 1) Love Triangle: there is always a lover who sits and watches the love of his life fall for the lead actor; 2) Extended close ups: characters stare at each other for a very long time until the music stops; 3) The Wrist grab: they have all kind of meanings like ' just stop' , 'don't go,'you're mine'; 4) Drunkeness: usually a heartbroken character trying to kill the pain inside; 5) Accidental kisses: the lovers accidentally fall or bump into each other; 6) Raining or snowing scene: probably good for dramatic and cinematic effect; 7)Secrets & Lies: the lovers hide certain facts from each other, because they don't want to hurt each others feelings, making things worse; 8)Sickness & Health: characters nurse their loved ones personally back into health; 9) The back hug or piggy back: the male gives the female a heartfelt back hug or carries her on his back, when she's injured or tired, or just to be sweet; 10) Separations: lovers have to be separated, always one of them leaves, sometimes without notice; 11)Kissing Scene shot from several camera angles: sex is only implied,never shown in k-drama, all we get is The Kiss; 12) Cliffhangers: in order to hook you every single episode.Are you still there? Then you will be rewarded with feisty girls, pretty boy actors (flower boys), excellent cinematography, catchy music scores and sweeping stories like Moon Lovers.The plot: During a total eclipse of the sun, a 25-year-old 21st century woman, Go Ha-jin (Lee Ji Eun), is transported back in time to Goryeo Dynasty. She wakes up in the year 941, in the body of 16-year-old Hae Soo and there, she encounters the many royal princes of the ruling family. She initially falls in love with the gentle and warm 8th Prince Wang Wook (Kang Ha Neul), and later with Wang So (Lee Joon Gi), the mutilated 4th Prince who hides his scarred face behind a mask. He's surnamed \"wolf dog\", because he had to fight wolves when he was still young and was treated badly as a hostage. Now he likes to foster his image as a fearsome beast. There's a fight for the throne going on. Hae Soo finds herself caught between it all. Thanks to her history lessons at school she comes to realize Wang So will win this battle finally. He'll become the future king of Goryeo, and a bloody tyrant at that. Soo loves So, but she also fears him. Can she change her lover into a better ruler in time? The Good: The first meeting of the 'Moon Lovers', Hae Soo and Wang So, sets the tone for the whole series: old fashioned romance but a love that hurts. There's the black Wolf Prince riding his war horse, first endangering Hae Soo but saving her as well by lifting her in the saddle in front of him. Then there's the extended closeup of their faces, sitting opposite each other, bouncing up and down, having their eyes on each other while the music plays their love theme. The next scene he seems afraid of his own feelings and So drops Soo to the ground. Their love is painful, literally.Leading man Lee Joon Gi is simply the best actor available for that kind of TV making. The minute he appears on the screen I am glued to his face and facial expressions despite his mask, that renders all kinds of emotions like joy, pain, embarrassment, hate. Notwithstanding his well performed fighting scenes, he's in danger of becoming a modern Rudolph Valentino, with female fans only. I hope he'll get the chance to proof himself in less romantic roles playing more tormented characters like the lead in Man on High Heels (2014)for example.The Bad: Moon Lovers is a remake of the Chinese series 'Scarlet Heart' with 35 episodes. The original version could handle all the princes and their love interests. The Korean production however should have cut some story lines to flesh out the characters of Soo and So, who are the protagonists, giving them more time to develop their romance. Now we were misled thinking Wang Wook was Soo's Prince Charming. Kang Ha Neul gives a stunning performance, so it was no punishment to watch him stealing screen time from Lee Joon Gi. But the story lines became too difficult to tell, leaving plot holes until the very end. Also there are still questions unanswered: is this all about(moon)love? Or altering history? Who knows?Nevertheless I would highly recommend this series. I was hooked for 20 episodes, hoping for a sequel.", "I am no fan of Korean TV series but I took an exception in watching since the plot was very complicated taking a step back in time. It took me awhile to feel comfortable watching since it took a lot of effort in reading subtitles while internalizing the dialogue. But right after Episode 2, I was totally hooked. I couldn't stop with just 1 episode a night and had the craving to just watch all 20 episodes in 2 nights!! Scarlet Heart Ryeo has just begun airing in the Philippines but I have access to the original version with English subtitle, which I prefer. It was giving me a headache listening to the Tagalog translation. Besides, it was more heart-wrenching hearing their original voices. So, as a fan of the Scarlet Heart Ryeo series, I hope that a Scarlet Heart Ryeo 2 is up for an international showing SOON. It may not have been a hit in South Korea but I hope that the producers seek the comments from the international audience for an unbiased feedback.", "Moon Lovers was my first Korean Drama, and i got addicted! It is simply SUPERB!!! The actors have a great chemistry together,and i will like to find out other movies or settings they had made before Moon Lovers! The landscapes and locations are fantastic,the battle scenes were like watching a well made action movie with great battle choreography. I was surprised from the costumes and fashion of the era that were Amazing,and most of all the plot is breathtaking! I can't hide that I cried many times over the 20 episodes i saw in just 5 days time! I recommend it to everyone,and i hope that there will be a second season!!! Please!", "Lee Joon Gi delivered his role of unwanted, abused, desperate-for- love Prince very well, and IU was very natural in her expressions. Their friendship and romance were slow in developing, but blossomed beautifully when they did, leaving viewers aching for more.They say a story is only as good its villain. Scarlet Heart has no shortage of villains, all the actors and actresses playing their roles magnificently 'til the end.Warning: This drama is not for the weak-minded and fainthearted.Overall: Good acting, good story, good soundtrack, good chemistry between the leads, good fight sequences, good cinematography, based on historical events (but filmed with liberty).I was hooked from start to finish, left with just one wish... that the director and staff have mercy and finally grace us with those precious deleted scenes!", "I loved this drama. The story and acting was amazing. I think all the main actors have done an amazing job. Ending is extremely sad, though. I would love to know that beforehand. I was really hoping for a happy ending, but towards the end the story was just getting worse and worse. This must be the saddest drama I've ever seen. There are some really sad events earlier in the drama, but last part is just tragic. Usually, when a drama ends like that, it makes me hate the whole story. But this one is just so good, that I still love it. Overall, the story was amazing and I love that ending was connected to the beginning. Just be prepared that it starts quite lightly, but gets darker.", "I donot know how I really feel about this serial. It started off pretty well. The story line and the character development of Soo and So made sense. But I dont know if this is me but sometimes there are loopholes in Korean serials. Like characters show really exaggerated reactions to mere things which ends up changing the storyline very radically. Like Wang so's reaction to finding out that Soo had loved Wook at one point was far too exaggerated and so was Soo's unwillingless to mend their misunderstanding. I can understand why Soo wanted to leave the palace, the king was changing into the man she feared he would become, the Queen's relationship with him as well as her increasing loneliness, but still i felt that her reaction to her servants death felt a bit exaggerated.At times I also struggled with Soo's character, She was shown to be a hot headed girl who was outspoken and bold in the beginning but soon it transformed into a typical Mary sue who was everyone's savior and was flawless.I think the main fault of Soo was refusal to marry the King, In the goodness of her heart she made the first move to priortise the throne over their relationship and I think that is where the conflicts started.\nI also felt that there were too many questions which were left unanswered, Why had Soo timetravelled? Who was the astronomer and how did he appear in the end? Why did Wang So's mother hate him- I mean his abuse at the hands of family was an important part of the story but the cause of his mom's resentment was never explained...? The last episode also felt poorly directed with chunks and bits and pieces from the past mixing into the present. I felt that the resolution was never reached and as an audience i didnot feel satisfied with the ambigous decalaration of the king that \" He will find her again\"\nThe one thing which does make this series worth watching is Joon Gi lee's acting. It is perfect. From his tranformation from a cruel warrior to that of a lover to that of a blood thirsty king, everything is perfect. \nIn the end I would say that with better direction and better script handling this could have been a much more amazing serial. I guess a season 2 could do a better job of satisfying the audience :/", "When I'm done watching the other korean dramas, I'm in a doubt if I should watch this one. But after I watched this, it hooked me. It's already months ago when this drama ended but I'm here, still searching updates about them and wanting to watch it again. I also watched this on a live stream and I don't understand anything what they're saying but based on their emotions, I feel that I know what's really going on. I'm even more emotional when I watched them like that. The acting is super b! I'm very impressed to all the actors especially Lee Joon Gi, who I know is very perfect on every korean historical dramas and Kang Ha Neul, who gave me goosebumps with his acting. Also, the other actors did a great job. The stage production and costumes will make you thought if this is a TV or a film production. 10/10 for me!When I'm currently watching this, I'm kinda disappointed to myself because I think back then, \"Why I am only watching this now? I should watched this before anything else\" That really make me regret back then lol-If you'll be watching this, brace yourself with a lot of emotions. You may find this a cute love story with a love triangle going on, but when the story goes on, a tragic moments happening and you may curse a lot of people when the Princes begins to battle for the throne. You'll find whose greedy and not. What they priorities most. Love or Power? Family or Love?I hope you'll enjoy watching this bcoz I never forget this one and it will be remembered as one of the best. On all dramas I watched, they were on my top 3 list. The ending may not as you expected as similar as the original series \"Scarlet Heart\" from China. But it's a good ending I think it's better that way that they didn't copy the exact ending happened on the original series. BTW, Lee Joon Gi mentioned that it's impossible to have a season 2, who knows. Maybe a miracle happened.", "Superb drama. The starting may feel entirely opposite to end. Very romantic drama. The story line is also perfect. The ending might be little different kind of sad ending but if there comes a season2 it will be good. The love scenes is very cute. The acting of all the cast is superb. I loved the part of Baekhyun as Wang Eun. Hes very cute and his acting is also very cute and emotional. All the actors are extra smart with great attitude. All the couples had great chemistry. The dressing of the actors and actress and their hairstyle is gorgeous. There were some scenes still hanging so it's better to have season2. That would make the drama perfect. The fight scenes were also nice. I can give it a 10/10 rating.", "What looked first to me as a soap opera, turned out to be a fantastic drama adding up more and more suspense from one episode to the next. The acting is just great. A lot of facial expression, a lot of gestures, only little action scenes. A great part is about how characters change for the good and for the bad throughout their lives. Many scenes are heartbreaking, if you follow the plot your emotions will be stirred up. Just the last episodes has elements in it that should have been left out since these elements distract from the overall message.It seems that they plan on producing a second series, if so, I am definitely looking forward to the sequel.", "I can't give less than 10 stars.

No wonder why it is still on the \"hot to watch\" lists even it ended months ago! Well, the story is about a girl who dies in a lake accident and she magically goes back in time, during the kingdom period, where she takes the body of a lady. She develops strong relationships with the princes of the dynasty, and the drama focuses on her story and how she enters the palace as a court lady and her relationship with the fourth prince, who is described as a wolf. All in all, I really loved her story, though I did find some disadvantages. First of all, the coming \"back\" from the future didn't really work, though it was forgotten after the second episode and it was only revisited in the last episode. Also, the comic acts were not that good, and they made the drama a little silly. Plus, the romance was strong, but I felt that the chemistry was lucking, though I did like the fact that she didn't develop feelings for the prince from the start, as it would have made the drama dull (twenty episodes long already it would have been tiring to watch if the romance had started from episode four!). Another thing that is only my personal opinion is that the male lead didn't work for me. As I'm not his biggest fan, I didn't quite identify with the romance, as he looked rather cruel at times and like a child in others, not to mention the \"You are only mine\" possessiveness didn't work for me at all! However, I did enjoy this drama. The performances were okay (the first episodes were a little awkward though), the costumes and the settings were breathtaking and the action and royal twists were enough to keep the interest high till the very end. Another plus was that the lead lady's character was well developed, as you could she her growing up from a bold girl to a respected head court lady. So, 6 out of 10.", "I felt the warmth of love, relations, bondings, funny moments, lots of emotions, climaxes and many heart breaking betrayal. This is by far the best historical drama for me.

The power battle in the channel was interesting, but the love triangle was the one who got the all kills. Probably, one of the best and most intense love triangle, with the guys fighting for the girl openly till the very end. The chemistry between the three of them was strong, as well as the performances. The side stories weren't that good, but nice enough to supplement the main story. Apart from the romance, the delicate issue of breast cancer was handled perfectly, as the characters went through all the stages of the treatment.

However, Moonlight managed to hit the big ratings and still gets the buzz even though it finished. That is mostly due to the good story: a girl who pretends to be a boy her whole life, ends up becoming a eunuch to serve the crowned prince, that ends up falling for her. Then there is the chemistry of the two actors, even though the girl was under-aged in real life, but still the age gap wasn't that obvious. Also the delightful performance of Bo Gum not only aided the drama, but also gained him a big fan base and surely future roles as well. I would like to add the good performance by Jinyoung as well, even though his story was side lined and it would have been better if his background story would have been explained better. Unfortunately the last episode was a little disappointing, as the story could have concluded in the previous episode.

The character Jinyoung plays, his story got sidelined although it was a given because he was a side character. It would've been better if his story got explained well.\n2.

So, she moves into the big house where the three heirs live in. Not that the story is something that you haven't seen before, but still I had hopes for something better. However, the drama kept falling into the clich\u00e9 cheesy traps again and again. The romance is okay, even though it was way too predictable.

JEON Tae-il is one of Korea's two leading martyrs in the creation of labor unions in Korea.  A poor young tailor, who was appalled at the abuses of the workers (mainly young girls) in sewing sweat-shops -- and struggled through legal code (written in old-fashioned Chinese characters, rather than in the alphabet most Koreans learned to read) to find the provisions that guarded the rights of such workers.  He (with his friends) succeeded in getting the press to pay attention (briefly) to both the abuses of employers and governmental neglect of its regulatory duty.  But once the press got bored, scornful labor department officials told them they were unpatriotic for complaining and the employers simply cracked down harder.  To try to get greater attention, JEON set his copy of the legal code, and himself, on fire -- and ran through the streets of downtown Seoul shouting \"We are not machines, enforce the labor code\".  His death apparently mobilized other young workers, leading to the creation of unions powerful enough to get a hearing on the issue of workers' rights.None of the above should be viewed as a spoiler.  The film maker assumed his audience would know (at least vaguely) the historical facts.  Park takes the story of JEON (set in 1965-1970 -- filmed stunningly with some of the best black and white cinematography I've seen) and interweaves this with the fictional (and told in color) story of KIM Young-su (and his pregnant girl friend Shin Jung-sun), set in 1975 (during one of the most repressive periods of military dictatorship). Young-su is a young law school graduate who is now on the run, trying to write a book on Jeon Tae-il. Jung-sun is leading a drive to unionize her own workplace.  HONG Kyeong-in is extraordinary as Tae-il -- and MOON Keung-soon is very fine as Young-su.  The script by director Park, LEE Chang-dong and Hur Jin-ho (who was also an assistant director) and others is first-rate.  The cinematography is excellent (at least).  The film ends with several minutes of scrolling names -- supposedly 7,000 in all.  These, it turns out, are the names of the working men and women who contributed what they could to the making of this film.  Their investment was well-spent.  A masterpiece."], "344": ["Age of Youth (aka Hello, My Twenties) is a 12 episode KTV show from the summer of 2016. The premise consists of 5 college aged girls/women living together in a rented home while they go about dealing with their lives, loves, families, jobs, and studies. It's a straightforward ensemble drama that will most likely grow on you pretty quickly.SPOILERS AHEAD!Not to stereotype them, but the 5 girls can basically be best initially summarized as follows:1. The sexy girl who's not shy about sleeping around. She cares mostly about herself, her looks, and how she can use those looks and her body to get various guys to be her sugar daddies.2. The cute girl who's desperate to be loved but won't be until she can bring herself to break up with her loser boyfriend and find some self-esteem & maturity.3. The serious girl who works hard to get ahead but can't ever seem to do so. She's had an unfortunate life, but her overly sullen personality isn't helping her in any way.4. The fun loving party girl who tries so hard to get a man to like her and see her as a woman, but always ends up getting stuck in the friend zone.5. The youngest and newest tenant. She's shy, has never dated, and is mainly concerned with just trying to adapt to the big city college environment and fit in with her new roommates.The girls are mostly somewhat strangers to one another, but they get to know each other over time, bicker some along the way, make up with one another, and generally just learn to get along and support each other as best they can. They do bond together and stick up for their housemates when called for though, and they clearly care for one another, even though they don't always know how to show it or what to do to help one another.Collectively, the 5 girls make a very nice mix of various personas & personalities, and this is one of the show's best attributes. They are all imperfect creatures for sure, and they each have their own back stories, a secret or two, and reasons why they act the way they do, but this only adds to their appeal as relatable characters, and you'll soon start rooting for all of them to succeed, grow, move on, or whatever it is they are each trying to accomplish.Though not hugely famous film or TV stars as of yet, each of the 5 primary cast members is VERY good in their assigned roles here, and they consistently work well both together and separately throughout. This is a credit to both them and the director, and this is augmented by the oft smart screen writing throughout the show. Each of the 5 gets fairly equal screen time and story lines, so don't be fooled into thinking otherwise based on the first episode or two alone (which primarily focuses on the young new girl).Aside from the writing, directing, and acting, one of the other things I really like about this show is its maturity. In a K-drama, you don't often see a woman nonchalantly ripping off her bra as soon as she gets home, or someone hoping her comatose brother would just die so she can get out from under medical bills and finally get on with her life, etc...The show was rated for age 15 or older to watch, and I think that's appropriate, but it has a very mature feel to it compared to most of the K-dramas I've seen of this age rating.There are plenty of other things to like with this show as well; in-character Q&A epilogues after each episode fit neatly within the concept of the story without seemingly being tacked on for filler or for no reason, the story lines are varied and nicely thought out, the show bounces back and forth between glee, sadness, and a common middle ground with ease, and so on. There's not much in the way of super fancy production values to speak of, but you don't really need them to be in a drama like this, and everything looks fine.The male actors in this show are basically all secondary characters; they do what's required of them well enough when needed within the framework of the overall story lines, but that's all they are there for. There are also several K-drama staples, clich\u00e9s, & tropes thrown in as expected; debt collectors, some talk of a ghost, a stalker type guy or two, sick/dying/dead people, etc...however, none of this takes away from the theme of the show, which is simply watching the 5 girls continuing their daily lives regardless of any man, side story, or anything else that's taking place around them.Overall, this is a really well done show. Perhaps the best compliment I can pay it is that it never wears out its welcome; the 5 lead characters, while you may not always like them or their life choices, well, they will be missed. Future KTV programmers, writers, and directors everywhere should take a lesson from this show, and that is: Always Leave the Viewer Wanting More!Summary: I wasn't even planning on watching this because the premise didn't seem to be initially appealing to me. But, I caught a few early episodes, and I was hooked. It's witty, well written, engaging, and efficient. I will take a story like this anytime over the flashier and more popular, yet often predictably unfulfilling, ones that follow the same basic K-drama premise time and time again. It probably won't be a big hit with the masses, or crowds that are mostly interested in \"Cinderella gets doted on by a bunch of rich young hot guys\" stories, but it is quite good.Bottom Line: Personally, this is my favorite K-drama of 2016 to date. I'm giving it 9 out of 10 stars accordingly...Totally Recommended!", "Age Of Youth is one of my favourite K-dramas and a must watch. To summarize, it is about five roommates in their twenties, struggling with work, romance, and family issues. I found it while browsing Netflix and decided to give it a shot. The first ten minutes were pretty boring and I almost gave up with it but I'm so glad I didn't.The thing that made Age Of Youth stand out were the awesome characters. Each of the five main characters were so lovable and I am hard pressed to pick a favourite, although I would probably go with Jin-Myung. They all have their secrets, and their very different personalities is what keeps it interesting. They all got roughly the same amount of screen time although I think it does tend to focus a little on the new girl to the flat, Eun-Jae, especially in the first and last episode. Although most of the cast is relatively unknown they all do a great job. I also found it really refreshing that the show wasn't just based around romance, as a lot of Korean dramas are, but I must admit I squealed a bit when two of the characters I shipped finally got together about halfway through. The writing is just overall very good, always maintaining the balance between humour and seriousness.Another great thing about it was the soundtrack. It was so calm and understated and for the mood of the show perfectly.One of the reasons Age Of Youth stood out for me was the quirky little original things, such as the mini interviews with the characters at the end of each episode. They were funny and insightful, and not something I've seen done before.In summary, Age Of Youth has a fresh and original vibe and I would definitely give it a try,", "There isnt much to say. It is absolutely one of the best of korean dramas. Well-written characters, fast paced scenario and no irrational scene. I hope there will be a third season(without reducing the quality of course).", "Found this show while searching for something a little different on my Netflix cue. Seriously a breath of fresh air! I've never watched any Korean dramas before, and wasn't sure what to expect. This far exceeded my expectations!I loved getting to know the five main characters, who become more and more dimensional with each episode. I did not want the first season to end! I highly recommend to anyone bored with depressing Indie American drama, who is looking for something with a little more heart.", "\"Age of Youth\" or the Netflix title of \"Hello, My Twenties\" is a charming, funny, fresh, and often addictive show to get into. I was disappointed to see that Netflix only had Season 1 available. Yes, that is how much I enjoyed it! I wanted to keep watching!This intelligent and creative show is about five young women who live in a share house. Of course, they come from different walks of life, have different backgrounds, and much like most people, each of them carries a secret. Like any roommates who share a living space, they get along, they laugh, they cry, and they often argue and fight. But make no mistake. These girls truly love each other and do their best to be there for each other. That is truly the beauty of this show. It proves that a \"family\" doesn't have to be your nuclear family. In fact, it's a bit interesting and ironic, that in some cases, these girls seem closer to each other than with their parents.There are some truly touching moments that might tug at your heartstrings, some incredibly hilarious moments that might get you laughing out loud for a spell, and even some thought-provoking moments. In short, this show has just about everything.First, we have Jin-Myung Yoon. Yoon doesn't say much, but when she does speak, she is honest and sincere, even to the point of being blunt. She comes across as cold, but she really isn't. Her \"tough\" exterior hides the wounded woman suffering through the pain of believing that she's alone. She's cautious about who she opens up to, and when she does, Yoon speaks her mind. She has a challenge of truly connecting with people and showing them who she is. However, she loves her roommates, and will do anything for them. She works three jobs and goes to school. She is the most mature of all of them, and she is my personal favorite. Next is Ye-Eun Jung, who is probably the most immature of the group and has some serious self-esteem issues. She adores her boyfriend, despite the poor way that he treats her. Everything is about status with her. She cares about how she looks, what she wears, how much she weighs, and what everyone thinks about her. She is prone to be thoughtless, but she is also cheerful, cute, and despite her clashes with Kang, she also cares very deeply for her fellow roommates.Ji-Won Song is the most energetic and creative of the bunch. She also has absolutely no problem expressing herself. She's never embarrassed. She will also frequently take the initiative in activities where others are hesitant. She lives her life a bit on the edge, and sometimes gets a bit carried away with the \"truth.\" She is rarely ever down or upset, and she is the one most likely to try and cheer up a friend.Kang Yi-Na is the only one who doesn't share a room with anyone else. A woman with a tragic past, she works as an escort. She also has no vices about walking around with little/nothing on, which makes some of the other roommates uncomfortable. She has more \"life knowledge\" than the other girls, especially about how men behave. She isn't tricked by the antics that men play, and this gets her into fights with Ye-Eun over Ye-Eun's naivety about her own boyfriend. It's a toss-up as to who is tougher: Kang or Yoon.Lastly, we have Eun-Jae, who is the newest addition to the house. She is also the youngest with the least amount of life experience. Coming from the country, she is a young woman who is extremely naive about how things work. It is also very difficult for her to speak her mind or even speak up about things until it's already reached a boiling point. Very sweet with a timid personality, she is very much like the \"baby sister\" of the group. All of the other girls feel a sense of \"protectiveness\" toward her.Not only is the writing top-notch, but so is the acting. These five women have a certain chemistry that can't be overlooked. They know their characters inside and out, and they make the show work! Each brings something special to the table, but it's those moments when they are truly looking out for each other as well as being there for each other that demonstrates the true power of the show. I would guess that many people would love to have a \"family\" like this! Why? Because no matter what happens, at the end of the day, they truly love each other, and isn't that what a family is?**Netflix finally released Season 2, and the show is just as good as ever, adding a couple of new characters, and leaving me hoping and praying for a Season 3!**", "Don't be misguided by the low AC Nielsen or country-wide ratings that this movie received when it was aired in Korean. This drama is certainly one of the most well written and directed compared to other dramas which is why I rated it a full 10. I have seen a few exceptionally good Korean dramas that got low AC Nielsen or country-wide ratings. I can only guess that at the time these great dramas were aired live in Korean it probably was aired at the same time another tremendously popular Korean drama (probably a period or historical drama) was being aired nationwide.", "This drama is so raw, It shows real people that are no differen from us.The story is not different from other dramas/tv shows about college students, hardships, dating, friendships and relationships. But that's the beauty of it, it's raw (especially that some k drama writers can easily go overboard with dreamy stories ans stupid romance that gets irritating after the first few episodes) this drama shows real people with real life stuggles, each girl had her own background and her own struggles. Anyone can watch this drama and just simply enjoy the calm beautiful atomshpere with a really relaxing OST.\nHighly recommend it.", "The series is about five college students, living at the same shared accommodation. Each one has a different story and a different mystery to solve. Even though this drama seems to follow the girly-sex and the city norm with young woman, sexual free and ready to party or kill each other, it leaves that stereotype far behind from the first few episodes and focuses more at the drama and the hardships each one has to deal with. Their love lives are interesting enough and, thankfully, the drama doesn't end everything with the perfect happy ending, living happy ever after with their boyfriends. Rather, each girl learns to be independent and to deal with their own demons. The performances were good and the chemistry between the five friends perfect to create a strong friendship atmosphere. So, 7 out of 10."], "345": ["W: Two worlds is an exciting, fast-paced drama that will leave you constantly guessing on the edge of your seat. The storyline is extremely unique and the main leads did a fantastic job in playing their roles. The acting was powerful and I really felt for them in some of the scenes. Although there are a few clich\u00e9s such as good vs evil, the plot is well written and pretty unpredictable. My only caveat is that some of the subplots in Oh Yeon-joo's world were not as interesting. Overall, this drama is a must-watch and most certainly among the best kdramas out there.", "Note: Check me out as the \"Asian Movie Enthusiast\" on YouTube, where I review tons of Asian movies.A romance takes place between a man (played by Jong-suk Lee) who exists within a webtoon known as \"W,\" and a woman (played by Hyo-joo Han) who is in the real world. The woman's father is the webtoon artist who makes the protagonist's life a living hell, creating the murder of his parents by the hands of an unknown killer. But as the comic world comes to life and clashes with the real world, the people of both worlds are confronted with danger.This is an interesting premise that has been done before. This K-drama has some vague similarities to films like \"The Matrix\" or \"Last Action Hero\", but it carves out its own identity and develops in unpredictable ways. In fact, it's virtually impossible to predict what's going to happen from one episode to the next. One reason for this is that it gradually adds layers and develops the \"rule system\" of this particular comic book world, which offers many intriguing turns of events and some wicked plot twists. The end of episode 1 feels like a climactic event, and there are many such events that throw you for a loop because they are things that would probably happen at the end of a film with a similar premise. This creates a sense of excitement that is sustained for most of the episodes, and that excitement is earned thru characters and scriptwriting instead of overblown or cartoonish action scenes.Most fortunately, the storyline is presented organically and naturally. This show does make an admirable attempt to sufficiently close as many plot holes that it reasonably can, but it still feels a bit contrived in spots. This is especially true during the final few episodes, which have a slight sense of randomness to them. Prior to that, everything seemed very neat and tidy in terms of following the \"rule system\" of the worlds, but that seemed to come loose a bit down the stretch. And that would be my primary criticism of this show \u2013 it seemed like they didn't really know how to end it. It felt a bit anticlimactic. Personally, I would preferred a more traditional, higher octane finale.In any case, all of the acting in this K-drama is very good. I've covered Hyo-joo Han a handful of times already in my reviews of \"The Beauty Inside\" and \"Cold Eyes.\" But she expresses a very wide range of emotion in this, giving a nuanced and energetic performance. I was less familiar with the lead actor, but he did a solid job as well.A few other random compliments are that I really enjoyed the theme tune, which is quite catchy. There is a splash of comic book imagery that I enjoyed. And there is also one particularly creepy special effect that is used on one character's face during the middle episodes.", "This is definitely one of the best dramas I've seen in a while, and I think it might just be my favorite yet, and believe me I have seen a lot of TV Series.. The acting is absolutely phenomenal and I love everything about this drama! The concept and plot is original and unique, and the actors have great chemistry. With each episode you keep getting pulled in by the story to the point you cannot wait for the next episode to come out. It holds a perfect blend of humor, action, suspense/mystery, drama, and love!! I never write reviews but I'm just so in love with this one that I want it to get the full recognition it deserves.For any of you considering it, I truly and highly recommend this drama!", "Don't be surprised if you'll end up binge watching this k-drama. It happened to me, though I was reluctant at first to see it. The story seemed a bit strange and complicated about two parallel worlds. Also I was misled by the synopsis thinking it would be a live action webtoon. However, this mini-series was so much more.I found \"W\" a.k.a Two Worlds a thrilling, well acted and visually glamorous k-drama that's a homage to old film-noirs and detective stories. Filled with classic heroes and villains, cliffhangers, blazing guns and screeching tires. The slow-paced, old fashioned romance added to this nostalgic feel as did the mysterious music score. I loved it!", "I really loved this so much. The story, the acting, the directing is superb. Comedy, romance and drama is well balanced. And it is so smartly written that i really respect the writer. I would easily give 10 star if it wasn't for the finale episode. But i can hardly blame anyone. This series needed at least 4-5 episodes more. And in order to tell whats happening, story barely focused even its main characters and romance. However the actors were so good to express the ever changing dynamic of the hero and heroine we get the feelings.And if it is ever get to remade by japan, America or any other country i would totally watch it again.", "In a personal view it is one of the most exciting drama to date! I love it so much! it is action pack and full of love as ever K-Drama does. Much can't be said as it will reveal a lot of the drama, it is one of those TV shows that you will just have to watch for yourself to experience it. The genre of this K-Drama is thriller, action, romance, and of course drama. So if your a fan of all those genre check this drama out! Will say it did feel like it dragged on for a bit, BUT I will have to say it keeps you on the edge of your seat as you wait to see what happens next! the drama itself is written very well and everything flows together. So check out 'W'!!!", "I love this drama.

First of all the story: a woman, whose father is a famous comic artist, gets dragged into the webtoon her father draws! There she saves the main character, whom her father tries to kill. Somewhere between the second and the third episode, the drama reached its peak. The story is quite interesting and unique, so kudos for that. Plus the romance was okay, a little weak though, and the performances very good, as the actors had to work with the whole fantasy world, action scenes and of course the exchange of worlds. However what ruined the drama for me were the flash backs. There were so many!! Except from the first five minutes, that were a recap of the whole series so far, which is kind of understandable, the back and forth-s were too tiring.

Finally, the twists were interesting and entertaining the first time around, but the drama seemed to have actually ended at the ninth episode, and so the rest of them were just repeating the same twists over and over.

Likewise she has to handle her husband's extra marital affairs and corruption case. Simply a model for all unfortunate women betrayed by men."], "348": ["If you've watched K-dramas before, you'll know that there are certain storytelling formulas that you can expect to be followed. Uncontrollably Fond certainly does not revolutionise the art in this respect, however this most certainly shouldn't discourage you, as what it does do is deliver an incredibly polished representation of the \"genre\", from start to finish.From the beginning the stereotypical dynamics appear to immediately emerge. Bae Suzy is the classic underdog female lead, whose father is run over by the opposing female main, and lives with the weight of injustice at the hands of a corrupt social divide. Kim Woo Bin plays the handsome, rich and cocky star who has had lingering, yet vague, feelings for our beleaguered heroine since their high school days. There is also the obligatory love rival, while the aforementioned opposing female main completes the love-rectangle. However, while these formulas are all too familiar, there are just enough atypical elements and twists introduced to keep the storyline fresh and engaging.. As soon as the story begins, Woo Bin's character is diagnosed with terminal cancer, and this represents the main driving force of the narrative, and the execution of this plot line throughout covers over other rehashed elements, almost seeming as if you are watching something entirely fresh and new.Of course, you are not- and there are some typical criticisms. Viewers will have to suspend their disbelief somewhat in the female lead's underdog status, given she is one of the most beautiful women in Korea, however since she naturally possesses a girl-next-door vibe, and they manage to compensate by downplaying her wardrobe considerably compared to the typical k-drama lead- it's no big obstacle.. In fact this arguably plays into favour- her wardrobe is more realistic to the character, and adds to the down-to-earth effect that you really can believe would make her a unique person to the hearts of the male leads, not to mention male audience members watching. There are also some bridges to be made in certain character motivations at some points, as is again typical, but viewers willing to accept a certain degree of this is inevitable will be rewarded.The pacing of the story from the start is near perfect, and the story seamlessly transitions from phase to phase at most of the correct timings. Personally, I had a huge gripe with the pacing elements in Kim Woo Bin's previous drama hit \"The Heirs\", as I felt the push-pull love-triangle phase of that story was dragged out far too long, and to the point where it grew stale and repetitive- Uncontrollably Fond has no such issues, and makes significant advances in plot, if not in every episode then certainly within 2-3. The acting is similarly fantastic in my book- Bae Suzy was previously criticised by many for her lack of range in \"Architecture 101\", yet shows off the complete spectrum here with talented subtlety. Kim Woo Bin too produces the performance of someone who has mastered their craft, especially with certain story elements that would have been difficult to execute technically as you will see.In fact, that encapsulates this production and why I was willing to give it a 9. We may not be breaking any ground here, but most elements ring of having been produced by people using the weight of accumulated experience to produce a well-rounded and complete article. This drama knows what it is doing- Uncontrollably Fond will toy with your emotions, pulling them this way and that- having you crying one minute and grinning like an idiot the next before the tears can even dry. As the subject matter suggests, it is primarily a melodrama, and a very successful one at that. By the end you can expect to feel hollow and empty inside, with a bittersweet nostalgia to the lives of these fictional characters, as the hallmark of a k-drama's job well done.So don't forget the tissues ready.", "Uncontrollably fond made me cry, I admit it (and there are very few dramas or movies that can make me sad enough to make me teary!). The story is about a girl who's dad had been killed by a hit and run and she is now struggling to pay off her dept, and a guy, who's a celebrity but used to bully her. Now the guy is dying by an incurable illness, and he wants to set things right for the girl. The first episode wasn't that good and I've even thought of giving up on the series. But the second one was great, and the drama kept going till the very last episode, keeping the interest high till the very end. The flash backs were beautifully presented and the characters' stories create a web, as they are all connected with one another. The story is quite interesting and the love story nice enough, but the main point for me wasn't the romance, but the whole justice- paid back was more entertaining. The performances were really good and helped the story to climax. So, 7 out 10.", "The most wonderful and convincing drama. Special mention to Kim Woo-Bin and Suzy Bae who were able to illustrate the emotions, the heartache and the challenges that their characters endured. An exciting and uncontrollably addictive series. Word of warning... don't skip to the end!", "This is a romantic melodrama of the highest quality. Beautifully acted especially by the main cast. Kim Woo-Bin is especially good in some very emotional sequences as he battles illness.It has that odd mix of high drama and very broad comedy so typical of Korean television and film.Our hero Shin Joon-young is a hot KPop/KDrama star and No Eul a tv producer wanting to do a documentary about his life. Of course they go through the normal hate you hate you love you romance with numerous plot twists and complications so typical of romantic \"dramedies\" but with the added punch that Shin Joon-young is dying.Seven boxes of tissues later it is all resolved. True love triumphs before our hero passes away. He is with his true love ... reconciled with his mother. His father who left his mother to bring him up alone realises the error of his ways.In many ways the final sequence where a video Shin Joon-young has recorded is played sums up the drama beautifully. It is heartrending. Along with the sequence where he stand by a sea wall and screams .. \"I want to live\".But what adds true piquancy to all this is that Kim Woo-Bin was diagnosed with a serious cancer in May 2017 only months after the series went to air in Korea.Life imitating art... As of the date I write this Mr Kim is recovering following multiple rounds of chemo and radiation therapy. I wish him well and a speedy and full recovery.", "Serious topics easy to watch, and very fer scenario flaws you can easily live with.The game of Kim Woo-Bin is really good. I believe he was quite a potential to play more serious roles apart of teen series. I wouldn't be way too petty with the directing and the small details (just to give some flavour on this the main actress usually fall and trip up herself in a very strange manner - something I never actually figured out, quite fragile I guess).The scenario is well designed, and w/o spoiling your watching (it is set from the very start), main character is charismatic and strongly presented in the series, mixture of idealism, poverty and love is quite substantial.I wouldn't classify this as \"comedy\" the whole story (apart from presentation and acting) is really serious and thrilling, great potential to make this more serious film. However it will be way off from the nature of the Korean Melodrama.My advice - watch it and tell for yourself.", "Honestly, I can't say anything except that this is one of the best korean dramas I've ever watched!\nI'm giving it a 9/10 just because of the ending, if it ends the other way around I would totally give this drama a 100/10 \ud83d\ude01\nI love suzy's and woo bin's acting a lot!

This doctor soon realizes Shi Ohn's autism allows him to absorb and retain all sorts of medical knowledge that a normal person couldn't. Shi Ohn is encouraged to learn and study everything he can until he grows to adulthood, wherein he's given an internship at a children's hospital to see if he can put his extraordinary mind to use in real world practice.Unfortunately, the autism that makes Shi Ohn so knowledgeable in the first place, also makes it difficult for him to communicate with people and grasp the nuances of social interaction in an imperfect society. He can't express his emotions properly, has trouble understanding his own feelings, and can't comprehend why people act and do the things they do (much less understand lies, jokes, ulterior motives, etc). Since he's both incredibly book smart and socially awkward, he's as equally resented as he is feared by his contemporaries; his genius might be able to solve problems they cannot, but he also might do something incredibly stupid that would put lives and careers at risk. Thus, a tentative relationship is born between Shi Ohn and everyone that now surrounds him to see if he can begin to fit in to society and be of help to the hospital and its patients.This is a little bit of an unusual show for a K-drama. It's more of a straight forward drama about the growth of an autistic man, and those around him, more than anything else. It does retain many familiar elements of this genre; there's some melodrama, antagonists, character growth, a little humor, and somewhat of a romantic angle, but if you're looking for some juicy or outrageous or angst ridden makjang drama, this ain't the show for you.Joo Won is the star of the show in his portrayal of Shi Ohn. This could not have been an easy part to play, but Joo Won is up to the task and remarkably believable throughout. He's got all the autistic mannerisms and ticks down pat, but more impressive is the way he's able to convey his emotions in such an effective manner without breaking character. He has to deal with a lot; being bullied, reconciling with his estranged parents, sorting out his first feelings of love, living on his own, making friends, handling disappointment, and overcoming his disability, all while he's trying to prove himself as a capable doctor and basically just get by in life. Joo Won really drives this show with his performance, and the more things progress, the more you can almost sense what he's thinking & feeling without him even uttering a word. Nicely done, Joo Won!Joo Sang Wook & Moon Chae Won fill the other 2 most prominent parts; Joo Sang Wook plays the head doc in charge of the children's ward, and Moon Chae Won plays the prominent young female doc in the wing. Both of them were quite efficient at portraying opposite ends of the spectrum that help Shi Ohn in their own way. He's demanding and won't approve of Shi Ohn until he's satisfied, and she's kindly and supportive of Shi Ohn at almost every turn. The rest of the cast is rounded out by some hospital trustee/upper management types, the kids in the sick ward, and the rest of interns & docs & nurses; they were all effective enough in their roles portraying an antagonist or benefactor or side story character or what have you.Writing, direction, and production were solid. The story is relatively well told, and it does make its way from start to finish rather well without ever getting too bogged down. And, of course, it all looks great on screen; this is modern day HD KTV after all, so that's almost a given with any show that's provided at least a modest budget.If I have any complaints to level against this show, it would be the attempt to (SPOILERS) incorporate a love angle between Moon Chae Won's character and Shi Ohn; this show probably would have better off without that aspect, and, instead just stuck to its overall motif of overcoming adversity and character growth. I suppose I could complain some about some of the annoying young hospital kids, and the standard drive by method of giving short shrift to various medical terms & disorders, but young kids usually can't act very well anyway, and, you can't expect the writers & cast to be experts in the medical field when considering the inherent time constraints involved with airing these shows.Summary: It isn't going to work for everybody, but I must admit that I quite enjoyed this show for the most part. The story is better than decent, there are several good performances (Joo Won, in particular, is outstanding), and, I thought everything was fairly well executed overall. It's ultimately a fairly sweet K-drama tale about a disadvantaged man coping with life, and, the realization that he's not really any better or worse at accomplishing this than any \"normal person\" trying to do the same. I actually found this to be a somewhat unique & rather heartwarming show (and, I'm saying this as a jaded, long-time viewer of KTV melodramas).Bottom Line: Well Recommended! 8 out of 10 stars on the KTV Drama Scale!", "I just came to know about this show from the remake. I must say original one is far far better than the remake. It will make you cry in every episodes and this is one of the best series i have watched so far. This show will definitely teach you very important life lessons and to be a better person, to make a difference surrounding you. 100% would recommend it and i wish there was a second season of this beautiful show. if you didn't watch it yet, please do. you are missing a lot.", "This story is remade in both Japan and the US. I have not finished the Japanese version. But for the Amercian one, the director is the one making the classic Doctor House. The 3D explanation on each medical case is really impressive.

The acting of the male lead is ok.I have come accross many autistic children myself.

The premise was an interesting one, and I feel the writers, directors and producers did a superb job of bring this to life on screen. Special recognition has to go to the truly superb acting performance of Joo Won. How he kept all of those mannerisms up throughout the series was amazing. Chae-Won Moon also deserves a special mention too. Her interplay with the other characters really helped bring the show alive, and the fact that she lights up the screen whenever she's on it makes it very pleasant watching. I devoured the whole series in less than a month and there wasn't one period during that time when I lost interest. Gripping stuff. Oh, and one more thing. Good Doctor had good positive messages throughout and didn't rely on sex and violence to keep the viewer hooked. Highly recommended and high praise to all involved.", "This version the original version is far better than the US's version. I won't add anything that is a spoiler. The acting is brilliant.

Should have been better handled.\n-It dragged at some points and got boring\nPossitives:\n-The cases were interesting\n-The theme and the story was so great and touching\n-There is a happy ending\n-The hospital politics made it more interesting.\n-The acting was great \nSo, overall, 6 out of 10.", "Found this intriguing using the premise of a doctor who is autistic, whether this could happen in reality is debatable. The actor who played the autistic doctor played it quite well with the facial and body movements, as I've met an autistic child with those mannerisms. It's described in this series as a disbility, but in many cases it has been shown that autistic people have an excellent retentive memory. The miss for me was on the romance front, how can the autistic doctor have a love romance with the female doctor, as it clearly states in the storyline that hehas a mind of a 10year old child!! Yes, I could accept that it would be something along the lines of maternal relationship, which, unless I misunderstood, this was suggested by the autistic doctor when he was confused by his feelings.

It's good enough. The romance was sweet, though it was quick and short, but I guess it works as the drama manly focuses on the hospital, the illegal activity that takes place there, the doctor and his relationship with his father, and his emotional issues. I think that the illegal cases were too ambitious, as they weren't really got solved satisfyingly. The medical cases were interesting, and the way they were solved was quite entertaining. Also, the story about the doctor was really good, as the character evolves and changes throughout the drama, as well as his relationship with his colleagues. One thing that bothered me was the fact that everyone called the doctor a monster because of his condition. I hoped that it would be like \"It's okay, it's love\", were they handled the issue very sensitively and introduced the audience to not discriminate people with mental illnesses.

However he eventually finds the con artist who stole from him and he makes a deal with him to con a wealthy man whose connections allow him to be untouchable by the tax team. So, this drama is a bit Ocean eleven with lots and lots of twists. The romantic story was almost non existing, but the cons were clever.

Maybe the cause of the whole romance driven story was the fact that they might wanted to make a light romance drama rather than a little more dramatic. But still, if so, they shouldn't have created such a dramatic background for her. Anyway, other than that, the drama was okay, with a strong and funny start, but with a so so ending.

But what about the story? Well, the drama is about a girl who is being compared to her beautiful and successful sister, even by her parents. That's the main idea, but, the second half of the drama focuses on her neighbour, who tries to find a boy who was kidnapped twenty years ago, and his rich grandmother never stopped searching for him. The good part is that there are some funny moments, and some scenes are cute and entertaining. Though the romance is so-so, the love triangle isn't boring, which is a relief.

But the shaman saves her. Years later, the cursed princess has to break the curse, despite the efforts of the witch to kill her before she does. So the story is based on many fairy tales at first, but sticks to its own main story for the rest of the series. The twists are plenty and that makes Mirror of the Witch a rich in thrill and suspense drama. However, those twists end up being repeated way too many times and that makes it tiring to watch. Needless to say, you will end up hating the witch, though the script doesn't try enough to give her a better in depth look into her story and her character. The story, moreover, gets confusing, with too many characters and action that is hard to keep up. And the romance wasn't that strong, though Mirror of the Witch doesn't relay so much on it.

However, after a while I settled into the pace and subtlety of the work and was well and truly hooked, right to the end.\nThere is a truly tragic storyline, plenty of magic (good and mostly bad), slapstick and humour aplenty and good old fashioned love stories.

But it's not so simple- there is no black/white -only shades of grey. This is the cornerstone and what carries the film -complex characters and their relationship between each other.

It was a good comeback for the director to give such a great movie after a decade of the gap. Also worth waiting for us all these years to get a movie like this. It was the story of a teenager who begin to look for his true identity from what he was known as.I was so curious after reading synopsis which denoted a boy with the five fathers. Yeah, it is something I did not get at that point, once I began to watch it was convinced me. A boy was raised by the five criminals, later goes in search for the truth after he's forced to step into a killing spree. The more he goes deeper to find the truth the more he risks himself with the dangers ahead. One after another the truth come into the lights which shocks him as well as the audience.I thought it was another Korean gore movie with gangsters in it. I thought that way all the first half till the twist come into the play. But the real twist was in the last portion which totally blew me. It was attached to a flashback scene, that scene was the best turning point which flipped the movie from its originality into the new perspective.I am seeing possibly Hollywood remake here. Definitely other industries around the world will show interest in this. Because the story was very nice with excellent characters and twists. One of the best Korean action movie of the year. The cast was good and so the direction with strong scenes everywhere. A sequel could be possible, which may concentrate more on the romance side. You should have this if you love the Korean movies where men are seen with the guns.", "Since nobody has reviewed the movie yet, I thought I could share my impressions about this EXCELLENT movie.First of all, I must admit that it had been quite a long time since I hadn't seen a good Korean movie, thus I was a bit skeptical at first. Fortunately, I immediately got absorbed in the movie. The actors are perfectly chosen, especially Jin-gu Yeo (Hwayi) who makes me think of Byung hun lee.Now one of the few things I was afraid of was pointless conversations that don't add anything to the story except making it boring. But I'm glad to say there weren't any, and I enjoyed every single minutes of the movie from the beginning to the end. Moreover, I found the fighting scenes really well performed, it was so realistic that I jumped with fright a few times. As far as the story is concerned, it is thrilling, credible and touching.In short, if you haven't view it yet, I strongly advise you to watch it, you won't be disappointed! 10/10", "Well last night I finally watched this movie ..I was so excited for it really . well first of all , I RECOMMEND this movie to everyone who wants to have a thriller filled ,dramatic,emotional movie ..so try this great movie . well in order for me not to spoil the movie for you ..I will just say little !! everything was epic and specially the fight scenes and cars races ..the Directer was a real GENIUS in drawing the best in the actors and specially \"Yeo Jin gu\" ,despite his young age but he was like possessed by the character to the point that you will not be able to tell if he is acting or he is the real Hwayi ,SERIOUSLY . well for me just few things stood out and remained mysterious even when the movie was finished ..I needed more answers for few things but they never made them clear ,specially some past events , but i think the need of the movie directer or even maybe the writer to show us things more than the others was the reason ! all the 5 \"fathers\" presented a unique character for each one of them ..with \"Kim Yun seok\" character I got the most chills cuz he was like super scary .. anyways ! If You are OK with BLOOD in movies ..cuz seriously you will see a great deal of blood and scary scenes but it all worth watching really ..so enjoy ^^", "Hwayi - Truly Monster !!Just jaw dropping ! The story is so brilliant that i didn't even moved from my seat while watching this. The main spine in this movie is the story it self. Park ju seok created a masterpiece out of this. Its thrilling, Engaging, mysterious. I praise Jang Joon Hwan for his excellent take on the debut. Acting by Kim Yoon Seok, Cho Jin Woong, Jan gung sun, Park jae joon , makes this flick into some heights. Yeo jin goo's hero role became alive cos of Kim yoon seok's acting with him. Mowg's music is beautiful, like the Kim ji young's cinematography. For any thriller movie lover, this wont disappoint you for sure ! 8 out of 10", "Hawyi(Yeo Jin-goo) looks like a normal high school student on the surface, but he has a dark secret shared with his five 'fathers' in a nice house located in some country area outside Seoul, and the tense opening sequence shows us how his life got involved with these people when he was very young. I will not describe it in details, but let's say this taut moment has some good surprises under its suspenseful mood including where young Hawyi is kept by Seok-tae(Kim Yoon-Seok) and his gangs.They could kill young Hwayi after their plan to collect the ransom was botched in the end, but he was instead taken under their wings, and that was the beginning of a strange alternative family. 14 years have passed, and Hwayi is now their loving son, and all of them are his dads while Yeong-joo(Lim Ji-eun), Seok-tae's wife who was a captive just like Hwayi at that time, is like a caring mom to him. Although he has never gone through any proper education in their isolated world, Seok-tae and his gangs have taught Hwayi lots of things including driving and sharpshooting, and, as revealed later in the movie, he is a very good apprentice to make his criminal fathers proud.Because Hwayi is approaching to adulthood, Jin-seong(Jang Hyeon-seong), the thoughtful and sophisticated member of the bunch who manages their dirty business, thinks Hwayi deserves to have a life better than theirs. While he can lead a fairly good criminal career with his learned skills, Hwayi also has a considerable artistic talent(we see several good sketches in his notebook at one point), and Jin-seong is willing to help him in any possible ways.However, it seems that Seok-tae, the leader of the bunch(while casually calling other fathers 'dad', Hwayi always calls him 'father'), has the other idea. Hwayi was frequently terrorized by the monster in the basement where he was locked in, and, though it is apparently a pigment of his imagination possibly fueled by his horrible situation, the monster keeps haunting him, and Seok-tae takes a drastic measure to solve Hwayi's problem once for all; he is going to push Hwayi more deeply into the dark, ruthless criminal world of him and others.The movie gets darker and bloodier after Hwayi directly participates in his dads' works and then accidentally(or fatefully) learns about himself more than he imagined, and the movie drives its story to the destined point with a vengeance through its volatile mix of family melodrama and crime drama. Some of its surprises can be easily predicted in advance, but they strike us hard with emotional impacts, and that accordingly pushes its main characters to their inevitable conflict calling for blood and revenge.The director Jang Joon-hwan, who made a long-awaited comeback with this film, shows here that the potential shown in his exceptional debut film \"Save the Green Planet!\"(2003) is not eroded at all. While it does not have that loony raw power of his debut film, \"Hwayi\" is a compelling genre piece packed with good action/suspense scenes and accompanying gray ambiance. There is always a foreboding sense of fatalism at every corner of the screen, and it is effectively manifested through its gloomy spaces including the certain crucial characters' lone residence surrounded by demolished houses.Things get complicated as the police and other underworld figures come into the picture, but the movie stays focused on the love/hate relationship between Hwayi and Seok-tae, and the performances by Kim Yoon-seok and Yeo Jin-goo ably carry the movie even when the plot become shaky at times. As shown in \"The Yellow Sea\"(2010), another dark South Korean crime thriller drama driven by the darkness of human heart, Kim Yoon-seok is good at conveying the steely brutality behind his plain but commanding appearance, and young actor Yeo Jin-goo does more than holding his own place amid the adult co-actors. The movie is essentially his character's coming-of-age drama, and Yeo Jin-goo is believable in every step as his character is transformed from a boy fearing his own monster to a man finally engulfing it. In that aspect, the movie reminds me a lot of David Mich\u00f4d's \"Animal Kingdom\"(2010), which was also about the sad loss of innocence in the criminal world.While it loses its steam around the ending, \"Hwayi\" is a gripping noir drama supported by its skillful direction and convincing performances. Like several notable South Korean films, the movie also reflects the dark sides of modern South Korean society through its gritty tale, and there is an interesting aspect associated with social class issues when hidden motives and connections are revealed during a chilling encounter between two contrasting characters. Its view on the modern South Korean society, which is still dominated by Confucian patriarchal ideas and haunted by the history of violence during the 20th Century, is ultimately pessimistic, but its somber ending comes with a small glimmer of hope none the less(There is a tiny but crucial scene after the end credit, so don't leave the screening room too early).", "I'm so glad I finally watched this. This movie was F****** AWESOME. Yes the language is warranted. The acting was spectacular from every character- especially Yeo Jin Goo,I was already impressed with this child actor since The Moon Embraces the Sun and I Miss You, but he literally BLEW ME AWAY here. He covered every single emotional beat, every scene with the veteran actors (who themselves were freaking amazing) perfectly. I can't rave enough about the acting here.The story was a lot more than I expected. I thought this would be like Coin Locker Girl when it turned vengeful and just become a bloodbath but damn- Hwayi was way smarter than I thought. Some twists I saw coming, others made me pause and rewind.The monster analogy was very well done, the part where he just stared it down gave me chills.The cops really got the short end of the stick here but aside from that I loved the ending. Amazing movie all around. Seriously in my top 10 K thrillers.", "Movie: Hwayi (18)Rating: 4.5/5South Korean Cinema is getting creative with stories day-by-day. This film HWAYI, too is one such action thriller packed with powerhouse performances, electrifying action sequences, touching emotions, and of course, a very new and creative story.I was excited since long to watch HWAYI as the trailer and its synopsis impressed me highly. I decided to check out the film. I couldn't do it earlier but when I watched it, I was left totally spellbound by the excellence of the film.I've never seen a film like HWAYI before. The story's quite new, unique and different, due to which it turns out to be highly impressive. Performances are a major plus of the film, as are the emotions and the action sequences. The visual effects too are impressive. One emotional sequence in the second hour had me feeling too much for the characters involved in it. I felt very sad and I felt that even after the film ended.If this happens, then it means the director has succeeded in his attempt. No doubt he did!Kim Yoon-seok...I have no words for his performance. He's the most natural actor I've ever seen. He never acts. He lives every character he plays. Here he proves why he's one of the best South Korean actors. Yeo Jin-goo is impressive in his first attempt, and his performance shows he has a long way to go. The screenplay is wonderfully written and presented on screen. The film grips from the very first scene and entertains you throughout the enrtire duration, and heading towards a climax which is excellent and makes you feel emotional.No doubt that HWAYI lives up to every single expectation one can have from it.", "one of the best movies i've seen in a while, even though the story is kind of preposterous. do Koreans ever make a bad movie? totally original idea for a movie and it really gets the blood pumping.the story is about a young boy about 4-5 years old who gets kidnapped for ransom by a gang of 5 men who police have dubbed \"the day breakers\", because they are so brazen. the whole gang is evil and the worst is the leader. so, they kidnap the boy from a really kind and rich couple, demanding money in return for the boy. they wind up keeping the boy, and he basically winds up with 5 unsavory father figures and he calls all five father.sound original enough..., sounds like a good premise for a really good comedy? not! fast forward 12 years and hes a teen now, but during all the time that has gone by, they teach and make him do a lot of bad things, with the final lesson being the act of killing somebody. during all this time they commit a lot of crimes and kill a lot of people. the cops are hot on their heels, but there is a mole in the department helping them out and they always never get caught.on their latest job they have to rub out a couple who refuse to move out of their house and make way for that whole stretch of area to be modernized by crooked developers. as a last ditch effort they hire the gang to rub out the couple and thats all i'm writing about the movie, because it gets really juicy from there on out, practically leaving me breathless.i would consider this a action drama thriller on speed, the movie takes you and wraps you around its story and you are just engrossed and can't wait to find out what happens next. production values are as good or better then Hollywood, and the action was top-notch with some MMA moves thrown in besides the gun-play and the explosions and car chases.the pace of the movie is excellent, it was neither to fast or to slow, plus there never was a dull moment. it is hard to explain, but this genre of movie when it is done right gives you such a feeling of satisfaction after taking the journey to the end. went in to the movie not knowing what to expect and watched a really really solid all-around movie. i would give this movie at least a 7.the title of the movie is \"monster boy\", because he literally in the dark thinks he sees this monster that is beside him waiting to do harm to him. i can't figure it out yet, but the title is somehow perfectly related to the movie and has a deeper meaning.great watch and definitely a first option movie. go and watch this movie, its really well done even though the story is kinda far-out, you will wind up rooting for the boy.", "I would have probably enjoyed this movie when I was in my early teens over now. Despite all the blood and gore in this. The acting is good, but couldn't really get immersed into the characters or the story. I guess they did the best they could with 2 hours and multiple different characters. The rising star Yeo Jin-goo is still rough around the edges but still good for such a young actor. I think his acting chops will continue to grow, plus he already beats out other Korean actors that are older when it comes to acting. Another actor that stood out is Kim Sung-Kyun but that is because he seemed to be impersonating the Joker. The plot is similar to something from a graphic novel which I thought was cool. Unfortunately most of the areas in the movie just seemed so darn underdeveloped and rushed at times. Making certain situations not as gripping or even to the point of not making much sense. The situations could have been more tense if there was more development in the story and characters. It's a good movie to boost Yeo Jin-goo as a rising star, but it's not a thriller that sticks with you like \"The Chaser\" 2008. The plot is passable and the action for the most part is realistic and good to great acting to go along with it. I give it a 6.5/10.6.5/10", "This was not what I was expecting but it is a decent film. My opinion is that it was more action than suspense. It moves at a decent pace, acting is good and the plot is different. There is a lot emotion in it and the main character really did a great job conveying his conflictions. I'm not exactly sure what it is but it was missing a little something. Not a bad movie at all though. Just be prepared for some highly dramatic action if you choose to sit down and watch it.", "The shootout at the end saved this for me.It's pretty good, with some some real flair.The build up to it, as SK cinema standards and practices dictate I GUESS, takes way too long and none of the melodrama, mystery or monster stuff works.With some swift editing, you could have a lean and mean 90 minute revenge movie with teeth but this just winds up being a too long distraction.But that shootout, that was really well done. I would probably watch that one bit on Youtube again sometime.", "I really enjoyed this film up until a certain point, that's when I somewhat lost sympathy for the main character. It's easy to figure it out too without me spoiling it. However over-all I did feel it was a well made film and maybe I just disagreed with the direction it took for just that 1 part, well maybe a few more as well. Seems also they may have set it up for a sequel considering the conclusion. Worth seeing if you like crime dramas and thrillers."], "375": [], "376": ["Daebak is a historical drama with my favorite actor/musician Jang Geun Suk.

Definitely worth watching.", "Many amusing moments and great characters. Frustrating in that it implies Korea has no patent, trademark, copyright, or contract law. The male is a bit too spineless at the beginning but comes around, while the leading lady defines tough and smart. The antagonist is an awful person and brings you to really root for the heroes."], "381": ["I'm one of those people who tend to think that South Korean movies are perhaps a bit too slow-paced for my taste. Memories of Murder isn't a fast-paced film, by any means, but this time the slow pace made this movie about an investigation of serial killings so much better than 95% of its American counterparts.Essentially, Memories of Murder is a drama first with thriller and comedy elements (yes, in the first hour or so the movie is actually quite funny). Kang-ho Song and Sang-kyung Kim are brilliant as the two cops who have drastically different views on how to solve a crime. The character development is fascinating and believable thanks to a great script.Highly recommended.", "This is probably the best crime thriller I've seen since \"Insomnia,\" and contains the most haunting climax of any serial killer flick since \"Seven.\" But like most films reaching for greatness, this is most admirable for its striking details.The filmmakers here craft a taut, careful, and delicately strung together motion picture that relishes in its amazing development of mood, place, and character.First, the mood: Haunting cinematography (rain falling on a small village at night, shadows darting across a thick field of grass, figures lurking in the woods, a masterfully choreographed hot pursuit scene on foot), a poignant music score (aided by the creepy use of a Korean pop song that accompanies each murder), and no-nonsense direction (peppered with fabulous doses of comic relief--how Shakespearan!) keep the film more and more intriguing at each turn and fascinating to watch.Second, the place: South Korea, circa the late 1980's, and apparently under some sort of militia rule. This is inspired by the true story of Korea's first publicized (and still unsolved) serial killer case. This unique time and place serves as a wonderful respite from the typical American big-city setting of so many other films of this ilk.Finally, the character development: The small details revealing the haunted souls of the detectives on the case is nothing short of brilliant. Witness the tiny executions of minutae: The cloth one rogue cop wraps around his boot so as not to leave scars when he kick-boxes suspects into submission, the harried chief of police checking his own blood pressure while trying to keep his off-the-cuff detectives in line or fighting to keep headline-starved reporters at bay, the young female officer desperately trying to showcase her abilities in crime solving between serving the chauvinistic detectives cups of fresh coffee, the outsider detective from Seoul's insistence that documents never lie (and the brutal irony at the climax that challenges his entire sense of being), and the main village detective's scathing speech on the difference between American FBI agents and Koren policemen. The beauty is in the details, and this film, like all the great ones, revels in their uncovering.One flaw is that some might find the film a bit long in the tooth, but this is not to be missed for fans of serial killer thrillers and police procedural movies. For the Korean filmmakers, and the amazing cast...this is their master stroke.", "I read a review about this movie and am aware what business it made in Korea, but nothing (I mean NOTHING) prepares me for this great work. With the exception of, perhaps, SE7EN, serial-killer movie has never been this good. The story (about real-life killings of 10 women in Korea during the 1986-1991) is compelling enough, but the actors (Song Kang-ho cuts you deep even when he's silent, and his big-city partner offers emotional jolts at the end), the director (effectively plays some scenes in docu-style approach), the cinematography (a shadow creeps out in the paddy field will give you, well, creeps. big one.), and the music (haunting) are welcome bonuses.One scene that impresses me most is the crime-scene midnight chase between a suspect, 2 local detectives, and a big-city detective (who doesn't know his local partners are there watching him). Humorously intense, or intensely humorous, whichever serves you well.The only regret is I saw this one on DVD, while I believe a movie this big (in many senses) deserves to be seen in theaters. Korean movies rarely touch Indonesian theaters.**** out of ****Try to listen the song SAD LETTER in this movie and tell me it's not haunting you. A magnum opus.", "Beginning in the fall of 1986 and continuing for the next four years South Korea was haunted by the nation's first recorded serial killer. Preying upon women in a remote rural community the killer was both vicious and meticulous, strangling his victims with their own undergarments and leaving nothing of any use to the police investigating the crimes. The killer was never caught.I do not envy any director trying to make a true crime film, particularly not one so high profile and so recent that the crimes still live on in the public consciousness. Stray too far in one direction and you devolve into saccharine sentimentality, go the other direction and you risk crass exploitation. Director Bong Joon-Ho avoided both of these traps by charting an altogether different route: he has made a film that is not about the killer or the crimes or the victims but one that is purely about the police officers charged with the case and the devastating emotional toll it took on their lives. In charting his unusual route Bong has created a bleak masterpiece, one that took home a stack of film awards in its native land but which has been largely neglected on these shores until now.The film begins with the first body discovered, a woman strangled with her own stockings, raped, tightly bound, and hidden in a drainage culvert. The detective in charge of the case is Park Du-Man (Song Kang-Ho) and it is immediately clear that he is out of his depth, that the entire local police force, in fact, are out of their depth. The crime scene is chaos, crowded by reporters and locals trampling over potentially vital evidence. Park himself is not what you'd call a systematic investigator, scoffing at the scientific approach and trusting in his supposedly unerring eye at picking out criminals just by looking at them. He relies on swagger and bravado and the brute force of his uneducated assisting officer Jo Yong-Gu.Serving as a foil to Park and Jo is Seo Tae-Yun (Kim Sang-Kyung) a detective from Seoul who has volunteered to assist with the investigation. Seo is the polar opposite of Park - methodical and rational - and it takes mere moments for the two to clash, clashes that lead to the two of them overlooking some key pieces of evidence.As the film progresses and the body count continues to rise you can feel a sense of desperation slowly settle over the department. Under educated, under manned and woefully under equipped the local force is simply not up to the task. As the realisation that they will not find the evidence they so badly need begins to set in Park and Jo resort to planting evidence to bring in suspects Park picks out with his 'keen eye', suspects they then set out to extract coached confessions from. The process inevitably leads to public humiliation. Soon even Seo begins to lose his faith in reason and just as things bottom out they finally catch a break and settle on a prime suspect, one who truly appears likely to be their man. But can they make it stick? What sets Memories of Murder apart from the crowd are the rich performances from its leads and the sure hand of Bong Joon-Ho. Bong knows exactly what he wants to do with this film and he steers the ship with a firm hand. He has a keen eye for imagery but he consistently avoids the cheap resolve, the quick hit, in favour of a slowly building mood and the film is all the stronger because of it. Song and Kim are both stellar in their roles, giving their characters much needed depth. You can feel their frustration and helplessness continually growing and when the final crushing blow is delivered you can feel their utter despair at being abandoned by a system that they have given their lives to. Bong isn't just asking how this could happen, how someone could be as evil as this killer, but how could a government allow this to happen? How could the police not be given the tools and manpower they so obviously needed to protect the people? The DVD release has been given the standard Palm treatment. The transfer is strong and presented in anamorphic widescreen. The film is presented with both the original Korean language track in 2.0 stereo and an English dub in both 2.0 and 5.1. The English subtitles are solid, clearly translated and easy to read. The disc also includes a reel of cast and crew interviews discussing their characters and the creation of the film as well as an extensive reel of deleted scenes.Memories of Murder is a minor masterpiece, a film that moved Bong immediately onto Korea's A-list of directing talent. It is richly detailed, beautifully performed and disturbing in precisely the way that people need to be disturbed in from time to time. Don't miss it.", "After two women are found dead in a rural community, a detective arrives from the big city to help out. Things quickly mushroom with the discovery of more bodies, more suspects and no end in sight.Whether you like police films or not you should see this movie about the real hunt for Korea's first known serial killer simply because its a great movie. This is a movie that alters your expectations and changes your view of things. Its impossible to guess whats going to happen simply because the twists and turns are so unexpected. At times this is a funny funny movie, especially if you like shows like Law and Order or CSI since what we take for granted in those shows is stood on its head. At other times this is a very taut thriller and you become as desperate as the police in needing to put an end to the madness.On top of all of this is a picture of Korea in 1986, a place with political unrest and civil defense drills that for me at least makes it seem like something out of the 1950's.This is brilliant brilliant film-making.I've given the film an 8 out of 10, even though it probably deserves to be higher, simply because some 12 hours after seeing the film, I'm still pondering what I thought of it, how good is it? At least an 8. I'm sure a second and third and fourth viewings will change my mind.Yea its that good", "What a good movie.What a great work of casting. Perhaps a little bit long, but the most part the movie is enjoyable and there's no perfection without mistakes. I think i haven't ever seen before a Korean movie and if there are much of them like this one i shall become Korean movie fan. The tempo, the thrill, the development of characters, everything it has been well worked.The direction is good yet without emphatic resources, there are just two moments with a little much use of slow motion but it doesn't arrive to be an abuse of it.If you can see it don't loose your time with Hollywood sad-bad thrillers bet for this Korean present.9/10 cause perfection doesn't exist.", "Being a movie buff and a director in the making, I watched this film (with English subtitles, Korean not being my mother tongue), I was completely blown away by this piece of cinematic excellence. There is not a single thing about this film that I can think of in a negative connotation. I wouldn't want to give away anything about this masterpiece. All I would like to say is that this is a film not to be missed. If I want any of my movies to be globally renowned one day, I hope it resembles \"memories of murder\" in any form whatsoever.This film simply belongs in the top 10 of the greatest movies ever made. 10/10.", "My \"one line summary\" might be too subjective (well it's just an opinion after all), but that's what kind of thought came to my mind after seeing this film. It just sucked me in and didn't let away until the ending credits appeared. I'm really not a fan of this genre which is popular in various \"detective\" TV series but this film was something exceptional. A perfectly made detective film based on a real shocking murder case in S.Korea in 80's. This is a must see Korean film for everybody and this must be a real pearl for those who love detective stories because perhaps it's the best detective film ever...I give it a 10/10 this film is worth it.", "Since a synopsis would be redundant here, I'll confine myself to praise alone.Each positive comment that precedes this is accurate. I watched this movie yesterday. I couldn't take my eyes off it. Everything taking place on screen was riveting, from the simple act of walking down a dark lonely road in the rain, to a wild chase by three desperate detectives. This movie held me in thrall.As a new viewer of Asian movies, I try to analyze the reason I tend not to be interested in western works any longer. I finally came to the conclusion that it has to do with the accessibility of the players. They seem to be people first, actors by choice, and stars, by the public making them so.In Memories of Murder, I saw this human factor almost too painfully. By the end of the story, I was in tears. Even now, the mood prevails. It's been so long since these crimes took place, and I don't know absolutely that they remain unsolved, but I think it's the case, and I think about that, and how frustrating it still must be to those who worked on the case.The actors have become the people in my mind, and the horrible sense of defeat that becomes palpable eventually, is heartbreaking. When one relates to the inroads made on the health; mental and physical; of the detectives, who are ultimately portrayed as tireless and completely dedicated to the case, you realize that you've watched something that is historic. You have seen the probable truth.The way this movie draws you into it, so that you are walking through dangerous rain, with a warning shout in your throat, points to the brilliance of the director and the players.It is difficult to say, \"I love this movie\", just as it is hard to say, I love Silence of the Lambs, because love is a peculiar word to use for such fare.But yes, I love it for the fact that during it, I was in a small village in South Korea in a terrible era of sirens blaring, military dictatorship, and the hopeless pursuit of a serial killer. I landed back here in this time and place with a thud, only after turning off the DVD player, and going to the kitchen for a glass of water. While I was caught there mentally---I felt the desperation, and I felt the defeat and the sorrow of the detectives, who were essentially decent enough human beings when all was said and done.There are not many movies that can time-travel you into their present. This will do it.I most seriously recommend that you view the interviews with the director and the stars (all of them are stars of a special kind in my mind) in order to dispel some of the hold the story will have on you.These are incredibly interesting people, and it's a sheer joy to see them smiling and peaceful. They're intelligent, educated and articulate. The younger members of the cast, the less seasoned, are so beautiful in their desire to do it right.They definitely did it right. They were wonderful, and they thanked the interviewer. How lovely that was to see.I watched the movie using the English subtitles rather than the English dubbing because I wanted the authenticity. The subtitles were very good.", "Joon-ho Bong directs \"Memories of Murder\". A police procedural, the film's first act flows along conventional lines. Here a murder takes place and detective Park Doo-Man is assigned to the case. He's a hotshot cop, hardworking and determined, who thinks he can spot a criminal simply by \"looking into their eyes\". Joon-ho Bong, however, repeatedly questions Park's abilities. Early in the film, for example, Park's commander points at two men at the far side of a room and asks Park to pick out the criminal. Park looks deeply into each man's eyes, but before he gives his answer, the director cuts to black. We assume that Park has picked the right guy.But 20 minutes into the film, and our faith in Park begins to crumble. Indeed, he begins to come across as a bit of an idiot. He's deeply superstitious, relies on fortune tellers, believes in hunches, and is highly insecure.At this point the film introduces another detective. His name is Sae Yoon, and he's been assigned to help Park on his case. The film's second act is thus a repetition of the first act, Sae Yoon re-enacting all the scenes that we just witnessed Park do. The way Park handles the film's first crime scene is contrasted with how Sae Yoon handles the film's second crime scene. The way Park handles an interrogation is contrasted with how Sae Yoon handles an interrogation. In seeing how a methodical, clever and genuinely skilled detective like Sae Yoon handles his job, the audience is forced to reconsider their views of Park. Maybe Park wasn't a hotshot cop after all. The juxtaposition between the way the two men handle the film's first two murders forces us to re-evaluate our perceptions.This notion of reassessing what our eyes see, is constant throughout the film. A mentally ill kid seems like a likely suspect, but is actually not. A local pervert seems like the killer, but is actually a caring husband. An effeminate loner may be the rapist, but DNA samples prove otherwise. Detective Sae Yoon, himself a \"by the books\" cop, eventually becomes a violent, loose cannon, determined to throw away rules and regulations based on a hunch, whilst Park, the very cop who consults shamans and witch doctors and stages false confessions, becomes the film's voice of law-abiding righteousness.And so it is the way the film's characters are constantly in a state of moral flux that makes \"Memories of Murder\" so exciting. The audience is constantly asked to \"look the characters in the eyes\" and reassess what they're seeing.But what makes the film great is its ending. If surface perceptions are inadequate, then how can we truly understand another human being? If personal emotions get in the way of objective truth, how can we ever trust our own acuity? And so because the criminal is never identified or caught, suddenly everyone is guilty. There can be no closure because everyone, police included, is implicated. Watch how the director contrasts the film's first shot (the innocence of a child's face) with the film's final shot (the retired face of detective Frank staring down the camera and directly at the audience). Frank's catch phrase, \"look into my eyes\", now takes on a whole new level of meaning. He's a cop again, and everyone including we the audience are now under suspicion. And so while most serial killer films end with closure, or in the case of the recent \"Zodiac\", with the comfortable knowledge that our killer is now old and largely impotent, \"Memories of Murder\" leaves us on a note of profound paranoia. We're left uncomfortable, disturbed, and everyone now seems a potential suspect. 8.5/10 \u2013 Though it isn't brave enough to stray far from genre conventions, this is a stylish, engrossing film. Worth two viewings.", "Two weeks ago I happened to watch David Fincher's \"Zodiac\", then (thanks to IMDb) I found out about \"Salinui chueok\". I got the DVD of the movie instantly and saw it the very next day I saw \"Zodiac\" and the outcome? I have then decided that no other crime/detective movie can be as goo as this South Korean masterpiece. It is power packed Two and half hour movie with equal amounts of action and emotion.Set in the times of mid 80's, the period in which the military rule imposed strict rules on the civilians, a serial killer raped women and killed them. The movie follows the investigation sequences of the village policeman with the help of the police officer from Seoul. The story deepens as it goes ahead, revealing a whole lot of sub plots, each one telling the complexity of team work and human nature. The last scenes of the movie can set your tear glands to work.The last scene of the movie needs a special mention in which Inspector Park comes to the scene of crime after a long time and a girl approaches him and asks him what he is looking for. And she then tell that a man had been there at that place earlier before (suggestively the Murderer). Inspector Park asks the kid how he looked like and the girl replies, \"He looked Normal\" saying that she goes away and Inspector Park looks at the camera indicating that the killer might be one of the audience watching the movie. This scene by far is the best one I have ever seen on celluloid so far. Kudos to the director Bong Joon Ho for making a crime master piece.Note: Please do not watch this movie if you do not have respect towards cinema made in other languages and also towards other countries culture and also this movie is not for people who always want a villain in the end!. Saying that I conclude saying, one of the best two and a half hours you can ever spend your life is watching this movie!Cheers!", "I have long since heard of the excellence of this korean movie on koreanfilm.org, but it was only after reading the review in detail and realizing that the score was written by Taro Ishiwaro ( a well known Japanese musician who also wrote scores for Shohei Imamura and Japanese TV serials, including The Inanimate World ), and that the DOP was Kim Hyung-gu (who also shot Musa, One Fine Spring Day and Chen Kaige's Together) that it stumped on me I was indeed missing a masterpiece.And a masterpiece it is, one deeply haunting and disturbing asian crime thriller. The mood invoked during the last few minutes of the film is something you would probably never forget.Watch this film not only for its cinematic brilliance, but also because of the mezmerising score written by Taro Ishiwaro, track no 29 on the OST the favourite on my list.", "This film is based on the true series homicide happened in the country of Korea from 1986 to 1990.Salinui chueok is similar to Seven but focuses more on the back ground of Korea at that time and explains why the police couldn't catch the murder.  The murder is very careful and cruel.  The cops are dying to catch the murder but the military government uses the police force to cease the protest.  The cops, also uses violence to the suspects to get the false confession rather than using a scientificinvestigation.After the film, I felt sympathy for the victims and was furious at the murder who hasn't got caught, yet.  This is the director's intention to make the audience look back the sad past of Korea.Excellent directing, acting, cinematography.  The best Korea film lately.", "This isn't your typical serial killer thriller. That's something that elevates this above other movies right from the beginning. But as that is, the question is if you're ready for a change? There's nothing wrong with most of the serial killer thrillers, that follow the rule book, of how to make a movie like that.Back to this Korean thriller, that shows us how cops are dealing with a killer on the loose. The behaviour of the cops (the sort of \"good\" guys) is strange to say the least. Their methods to interrogate people is at least unorthodox! And that's things you have to keep in mind before you watch the movie. Because if you think that this might be a problem for you, then it will be a problem for you for sure, after you watch the movie!", "\"Memories of Murder (Salinui chueok)\" is an involving, cross-cultural take on the \"L.A. Confidential\" noir genre of a murder mystery with a political filter, layered with elements that gritty British TV detectives have mastered, from \"Prime Suspect\" on.While co-writer/director Joon-ho Bong uses the conventions of the contrasting buddy cop movie, sometimes simplistically for comic effect, he has more social commentary on his mind than a captivating investigation into a serial killer and avoids the usual titillating gore fest.Set specifically in 1986, the film visually captures the changes in industrializing, modernizing and politically restive South Korea, where new, dark, noisy factories were sprouting up in the middle of agricultural areas. From the opening shot that could be out of \"Witness,\" we see a peasant bring what looks like a city sophisticated cop to a crime scene.But that's just the start of the conflicting comparisons. We've seen enough \"CSI\"s to sympathize with him immediately as he hopelessly tries to secure the crime scene for clues despite a Keystone Cops-incompetent forensics and investigative team who keep sliding into the irrigation ditch. But he starts to seem a bit of a buffoon to us as he gives more credence to gossipy tips from his girlfriend than clues from the scene and he manufactures \"evidence.\" Our sympathies are curdled even more as we see him conduct an old-fashioned coercive interrogation of a developmentally disabled suspect -- and he's the good cop. Even without knowing anything about Korean law, it certainly looks like they are compromising the investigation, as his thug partner, who is nowhere as complex as Russell Crowe's Bud White, gets as out of control as a cartoonish \"Lethal Weapon\" cop, and that cop never grows and develops in the story beyond being a brutality enforcer so becomes a pathetic comic figure. Their complicit boss just seems ineffectual as he's clearly over his head with this kind of murder investigation.But through the background TV broadcasts of demonstrations and civil defense alerts and drills, we gather that their interrogation procedures were more developed through oppressing political dissidents and forcing confessions than professional criminal detective work. Ironically, they ultimately can't get the resources they need in this difficult case because of these politically-drummed up time-consumers, especially for manpower and sophisticated forensic tools that they have to beg from the FBI.The film changes tone and settles down into an intellectual thriller as a classic big city detective is sent from Seoul, and we have some of the interchanges we've seen in \"In the Heat of the Night\" and in \"Insomnia,\" as the first cop now seems even more of a simpleton in his standard operating procedures of relying on his knowledge of the locals and instincts about human nature (though even a fellow officer teases him about whether he can tell apart a rapist and victim's brother), while the city guy is looking and listening for clues and real evidence, like a Korean \"Dalziel and Pascoe.\" But the tension is ramped up as the killer keeps killing \u0096 and the film starts showing us the murders as they are about to happen just as the cops are getting hints about his modus operandi and even after the police are on alert. Their frustration at not being able to stop him is grippingly conveyed by the lead actors, as each starts to abandon their usual procedures out of mounting frustration, and by the editing.A droll side bar is that the macho team is given a key clue by a policewoman who they otherwise relegate to getting them refreshments. Their macho attitudes also keep them from learning vital clues from the marginalized men they pick up as suspects.The coda in contemporary Korea is effective, reinforcing a sense of societal complicity is letting such murders happen and go on, though I was curious what happened to the city cop as well as the local guy. I had no idea until I read the IMDb message board that this was a based on a real case, so I appreciate even more that a cheap ending wasn't tacked on.The cinematography and editing are terrific throughout, with many of the scenes in the dark and rain. Particularly dramatic are harrowing scenes along railroad tracks and a tunnel that are reminiscent of stark imagery from Mervyn LeRoy's \"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang.\" It is frustrating for English subtitle readers that not more of the Korean on the screen, such as newspaper headlines or heard, such as the TV broadcasts and pop tunes, isn't translated.", "Having seen a lot of good films this year, I picked this up after watching Thirst and wanting to see more of Song Kang Ho, remembering him being great in the Host. However, I was blown away by the fact that I never found this film earlier and while Song is excellent in it, the film and nearly everything about it is flawless in execution. The story about a detective in a small countryside town who finds a serial killer yet it's the incompetencies of the police force in general and human error which leads more and more murders. As the murders continue they find themselves powerless to use whatever clues they have to find the murderer. I'll leave it at that in terms of plot as it the film beautifully pulls you in until it's frustratingly simple conclusion. The cinematography is outstanding with a haunting score worthy of the film's amazing direction. I simply cannot find the words to describe how great this film is. I rarely watch films twice and never watched a film again without getting bored. On repeated viewings, you begin to appreciate the little scenes the director has put in and i didn't pick up one of the running gags until the third time though, they add little to the plot but are enjoyable and fascinating as the director chooses to move at his own pace. While not perfect, the quality of the film brings the smallest niggles to light and while there are only a few, this film does not get the recognition it deserves in the west, yet at the same time, it's like a little secret that is appreciated by those who are lucky enough to find it. As with any murder and mystery, you'll be looking for clues, even on multiple viewings but at best you'll be grasping at straws and jumping to conclusions until the frustratingly simple ending", "If you want to know why koreans (especially south koreans) are really into the movie you gotta know the history of 80's korea. during 80's south korea had been ruled by military government. Do you remember the siren which sounded when the killing is happen? that siren was controlled by military government. after the siren, nobody is allowed walking outside. they might think it could suppress commiees or anti-Gov gruop action.  AS you've seen the siren had become the perfect chance for murder.", "Memories Of Murder is based on a true story of a south-Korean little village in which someone begins to murder young women. The Police can't catch the killer so an agent comes from Seoul to give a hand in the investigation. Soon he'll find that local police's methods are rather brutal, and that they're most interested on finding a scapegoat, someone to blame in order to ease the in tranquility of the population, than on catching the real killer (according to the real facts, they never catched the author of those crimes).The script is solid as a rock, and it's been filmed in a realistic style. trying to show the facts as they happened. Maybe they should've made a shorter movie, and cut some sequences out (the scenes of the interrogations to the three different suspects are a little bit reiterative), and the ending seems a little forced to me. Anyway, Memories Of Murder is much more effective and serious than the most of nowadays' Hollywood detective films.My rate: 7.5/10", "There are only a handful of serial killer films that actually work, and with the Korean-based \"Memories of Murder,\" it's evident that director Joon-ho Bong has done his homework.Successful examples include \"Seven\" and \"Silence of the Lambs,\" a pair of films that expose their audience to grisly and suspenseful sights, but all the while creating vivid characters and memorable stories. Other films like \"Fallen\" and \"The Bone Collector\" do not. What makes \"Memories\" as unforgettable and dynamic as say \"M,\" is that the actors of this film are realistic, the story is believable, and the climax is original. You feel the apprehension of the characters, you struggle to understand the killer's motives, and you grimace at the way his victims are taken. Getting under your skin is what serial killer films are all about, and this is no exception.In South Korea in 1986, a naked woman is found bound and gagged in a drainage ditch in a field, and a pair of detectives and a special agent from Seoul has been assigned to find the murderer/rapist. Their efforts are numerous in trying to track down the killer, not taking anything for granted; they even attempt to find clues through the help of a fortune teller, and by even giving merit to the possibility that the killer may shave his pubic hair. Their crime scenes are routinely disturbed by locales, key pieces of evidence are run over by tractors, their forensic team is always a no-show, and their only help at solving the crime thus far is a handicapped boy, who may or may not be the killer. Yet with the boy in custody, and the murders continuing, a serial killer is indeed on the loose.The film has numerous touches of comedy that arguably helps the film numb down its depressing nature; many of these comedic touches involve one of the detective's constantly jump-kicking witnesses and suspects. The detective so habitually beats any and all suspects that he made a custom \"bootie,\" as to assure that his kicks won't leave any scratches. The way the film handles the humor is quite ingenious though, simultaneously showing the downfall and wrongs of police justice, the fallibility of investigative methods, and how a homicide system works without the prevalence of DNA tests. The musical score is terrific and adds tension to every scene, the camera work is top-notch and South Korea's fields and forests remain a visually scenic and eerily set landscape. The acting is genuine by everyone involved, especially from Kang-ho Song, the lead detective who sees the wrongs of the system but can only stand by and watch. The director does a fantastic job creating the mood, and like all atmospheric thrillers, the film is almost consistently covered with rain-shadow. His uncanny ability to create suspense when nothing is visibly threatening also earns the director much praise, and he makes the viewer see what the killer sees, with expert detail. As the murderer lurks behind trees, hides behind field stocks, and picks his prey, so do you and it works wonderfully. Based on the first recorded serial killer in Korean history, \"Memories of Murder\" is a film not easily forgotten. With memorable visuals, a haunting score, and quite hilariously brutal police work, the film adds realism to a very mature subject matter and succeeds brilliantly. The film was released in 2004 in limited release, and most video stores do not carry it. You can get it off Netflix or any online store that sells dvds.", "Recent Korean (and other international) films have surpassed Hollywood films in many ways except in the department of special effects. Special effects and big names is the main reason Hollywood still rules. However, for sheer originality and creativity, look away from Los Angeles towards Seoul.This grisly, dark, eccentric film shows why. \"Salinui chueok\" is a quirky, moody film that starts off not quite serious, almost comic. Well, not surprising, since the two naive, rural cops don't deal with much crime in the countryside in a militia-ruled Korea (set in the mid- 1980s). They find themselves in a case they can't handle: they have to deal with a serial murder that gathers press coverage and scrutiny. As the murders grow, detective Park has to compete with the smarter detective Seo from the big city (Seoul) and he learns solving crimes isn't just about intimidating suspects. The city and rural cops have to cooperate increasingly to try to capture the murderer. But the teaser, as all unsolved murders remains. The witnesses are unable to help, confessions are worthless, and the killer runs free. The film evolves into a serious masterpiece as Park matures throughout the movie from using police brutality to dealing with the press and proper evidence. As the end the film shows a more mature Park with a family maybe moving on...but not quite, he is still haunted by memories of a murder.Acting and cinematography are outstanding. It's a nice cultural peek into a rural Korea with unadorned eateries, schools with outhouses and broken-down police cars. The quirky fascinating characters (the half-crazy detective Cho or the simpleton Kwang-ho) add to the fun.", "This one is a interesting film with a deliberate pace that starts slow, then, builds to a surprising ending.There have been several murders of pretty girls in a small country town. The two local detectives, quickly grab up a mentally challenged kid from the village. It was known that the lad liked the one victim.The two detectives administer some rather forceful third degree to the lad. They then get the lad to record a scripted confession. The case is solved and the two are local heroes.That is, till, a detective sent from Seoul arrives. This detective goes over everything and realizes the boy is not guilty. The boy is released and the local cops are less than amused with the new cop on the block.The new guy quickly shows his stuff though by going over the evidence and finding more victims. The local boys again grab up the first suspect for some country justice. Of course they are a bit too quick off the mark and this man is also innocent. The pace picks up steam as more women are added to the victim list. A woman cop helps out by pointing out all the murders happen on rainy nights, and when a certain song on the radio is played that same night.The net is thrown wider and a girl who survived an attack is located. Off her somewhat cloudy description, a new suspect is rounded up. This time the locals do not resort to the \"in your face\" interview tactics. They do not want anything that could foul up the court case. The man though does not break, and is set free. The police do however have people tail the suspect.There is a mix-up with the assignments and the tail is lost. Another dead girl is the result. On this victim there is a small bit of DNA evidence not ruined by the rain. This is sent off to the States for the FBI to examine.The evidence comes back as inconclusive. The Seoul detective knows they have the right man no matter what the evidence says. Now he goes off the dead end, he intends to kill the suspect. Does he? Not saying.", "Memories Of Murder, is a highly entertaining well grafted and nigh on perfectly designed piece of cinema about the real life killings of local village girls during the 1980s in South Korea. Memories sets out to make a serious film and not trivialise these events, which it does in a very simple manner coupled with exceptional cinematography and highly idiosyncratic characters whose introductions never over shadow the films events.Memories Of Murder has its own agenda on commentating on these events, making it quite clear that the social situation created in Korea at the time meant the government was \"too busy suppressing its own citizens to put resources into a proper investigation\". And it is that which is the overriding theme throughout. There is a sense when you watch this film that the operation was completely botched. Not only did the police forces lack the necessary forces to cope with such a killer, but also that the police were more concerned with finding a 'scapegoat', as is seen in the interrogation sequences. They adopted a 'any face will do' motif, and they lost not only valuable time, but face with the public.Memories is marked by a trio of outstanding performances by Song Kang Ho, Kim Sang Kyung and Park Hae-Il who each bring something unique to this creation. Their rivalry and own internal issues mean they clash with each other and must look deep within themselves for answers while yet never distracting from the film. Kang-Ho Song provides the most intriguing of all the three detectives. At the start of the film we see he has no actual intent in catching the killer and a forced confession is enough for him to sleep easy at night, as long as he thinks he's right. However he has a gift for being able to deduce whether people are telling the truth or not by looking into their eyes. The legitimacy of this 'gift' however is questioned throughout the course of the films duration, even by his own family, which is well done in keeping the audience hooked as we want to believe in him but don't know if we should. Detective Seo Tae-Yoon (played by Sang-kyung Kim) is the enforcer of the trio, a high flying, heavy boot wearing, hot headed time bomb. His deep seated anger issues and a a somewhat noticeable lack of refined sensibilities in policing enquiries hamper a man who in the end wishes to do good and we can still sympathise if not empathise. Roe-ha Kim as Detective Cho Yong-koo is the most gripping of the three as his transformation throughout the film as he delves deeper into the depraved mind of a sadistic serial killer, begins to haunt him more than it does the other two. Having been sent in from Soeul he is charged with responsibility of finding this man and the toll it takes on him as a human being is remarkable. There are obviously more issues to discuss about how good this film is but the acting speaks for itself and is truly the driving force of this film, and 'will' keep you watching.Memories is a wonderful film, which is by no means perfect, but its fusion of serial killer thriller will drama and black humour gives this all too familiar genre a refreshing new twist, if Zodiac were any good this is the type of film it would be like, and is more often than not provocative. It's nail biting tension provides the audience with moral qualms throughout, questions over our honour, our integrity and our principles. The notion of What Is Justice? rings out loud and inevitably there are only answers to be found within yourself. While some may find the ending forced, I found it pleasant within the context of the film as it served its purpose to highlight the damage done to our three protagonists. Memories is a must watch film if you are a fan of Korean cinema or the genre, but more importantly, this is a really good film that anyone interested in film (from anywhere) should view and enjoy. This is one you 'will' remember.", "Based on an actual series of murders in South Korea between the years 1986 and 1991, Bong Joon-ho's Memories of Murder is a well performed, thought-provoking film about the investigation into Korea's first serial killings. The film, which combines bleak reality with dark comedy, is less about the actual crimes than about the emotional toll it took on the police officers investigating the case.The film opens in 1986 when South Korea was still under the control of a repressive military dictatorship. A woman's body is found in Gyunggi province in a drainage pipe in a rural area outside of Seoul, raped and strangled by her own stockings. The crime scene is chaotic. Reporters and spectators mill about and a tractor rides over the area destroying footprints and other potential evidence. Local police officers Park Doo-man (Song Kang-ho) and his aggressive partner, Cho Yong-ku (Kim Roe-ha) are in charge of the investigation but are joined later by a volunteer from Seoul, detective Seo Tae-yoon (Kim Sang-kyung).The police, however, are preoccupied with protest demonstrations against the government, and do not put the necessary manpower and resources into a proper investigation. A rivalry soon develops between the intuitive Park and the cerebral Seo. Park claims that he can detect a killer by simply looking into a suspect's eyes. Seo is more rational and scientific but both overlook crucial evidence and both do not hesitate to brutalize suspects. Although they force confessions from Baek Kwang-ho (Park No-shik), a retarded man, and a man who masturbates at the crime scene, they know that the confessions will not stand up in court. Showing signs of desperation, they torture an eyewitness to the murders to the point where he tries to escape and is run over by a passing train.Eventually the detectives locate a suspect who admits that he requested a song heard on the radio each night a murder has been committed, but not a shred of evidence is ever found. After they beat him, he tells the police, \"People know you torture innocent people.... You'll never victimize me.\" Memories of Murder presents a powerfully haunting picture of a society so inured to violence and repression that a serial killer is a minor annoyance. As more strangled women are found, a sense of sadness and frustration begins to settle on the investigation and it becomes obvious that the police force is not prepared either by education or methodology to achieve results until the society it operates in can be purged of its authoritarian past.", "Echo many of the excellent reviews here - I didn't realise how much the film was a subtle criticism of the 80s dictatorship, though one murder takes place precisely because too many police have been sent to halt disturbances so that there aren't enough to protect the town hit by a series of sex killings. The first half-hour to hour is blackly comic, slightly farcical (forensic evidence destroyed by incompetence), but, for me, the film's greatness is when its tone changes - and the borders between the two leading detectives, Park, &, Suh, become blurred until Suh breaks down. The downbeat ending lingers in the mind, and its realistic portrayal of a desperate police investigation is head and shoulders above most Hollywood sensational crime pics.", "I don't really need to see another serial killer movie but I'm inevitably drawn to look. Most are stupid, clich\u00e9d, and incredibly disappointing -- the obvious exceptions are the two classics: \"Silence of the Lambs\" and \"Seven\".The performances are superb. Rich, fully realized, fully human characters that are sometimes very faulted, sometimes funny, sometimes surprisingly heroic. The tech credits in this movie are uniformly excellent. The cinematography and editing are as good as anything you'll see.This is a first rate investigation that has plenty of twists and turns, red herrings, drama, suspense, and humor. But what sets this apart from most is its focus on the detectives -- their foibles, weaknesses, faults, and humanity.SPOILER ALERT: The key difference between this and most serial killer movies is that the killer is never found. But this movie is ultimately not about finding a killer. It is about the effect the investigation has on the detectives -- something we almost never see.A superb film. If you liked \"Seven\" don't miss this one!"], "382": ["Click your heart is a drama you have to watch if you're a SF9 stan. But, also, it's not that bad on its own, though the best entertaining element is knowing who's who. I didn't get the concept at first, and I was confused when the girl started a romantic story with Dawon, when she had some progress with Rowoon in the previous episode. But, after understanding that we are presented with possibilities of choices and their outcome, it gets easier to watch and follow. Cute love stories, one of them actually sad, but overall, an easy watch."], "383": [], "384": [], "385": ["To sum it up, 'Nightmare Teacher' is about mysterious things happening at a Korean school. A new teacher arrives, and offers his students the chance to come see him in the counselling room. Once the students are there, they make a deal and sign a contract with him to get something they want, and it all starts to look up for them. However it goes downhill for each student pretty quickly and always ends badly, and afterwards nobody can remember the students who signed the contract. The first 10 episodes focus on five students, two episodes for each student, and the last two episodes focus more on solving what is going on.The two main characters, Ye-Rim and Sang-Woo were awesome. Intelligent, funny, and caring, what more could you want? Ye-Rim is class president so takes it upon herself to be responsible and find out why people are disappearing and Sang-Woo, who has a huge crush on her, helps. I was rooting for Sang-Woo the whole time, he was definitely trying his hardest to impress Ye-Rim! Their acting was good, as was most of the cast's actually.Most of my problems with this was the plot. Each of the students who signed a contract with the teacher had very fickle wishes: popularity, beauty, a boyfriend, etc. I guess they were trying to make it relatable for teenagers but frankly all the secondary characters were just stupid. Who signs a contract in blood? They clearly don't think things through! Also the plot was a bit inconsistent, especially in episode eight when the boy who signed the contract seemed to be recovering and being independent and then all of a sudden for no reason he deteriorated again into his former state. The thing that ruined this for me was the ending (major spoilers ahead). Ye-Rim is in the dream world trying to figure out what is going on, and Mr. Han pretty much tells her how to escape, so obviously she does. When she wakes up he just decides 'Oh well lets just forget this whole thing ammiright' and just rewinds all the events. This made no sense to me. If the dream place was his 'heaven' as he called it, why did he just get rid of it? Because one girl escaped, because YOU TOLD HER HOW TO? As none of the students remember it they haven't learnt their lesson so they're basically all going to be the same terrible/stupid people they were before. It just made no sense and seemed lazy and rushed. Also Ye-Rim and Sang-Woo had remarkable luck to get this far anyway, seeing as he obviously knew they were sneaking around his office and could easily have called them out in it. Did he want them to succeed? But how on earth would that benefit him when they are jeopardising his 'heaven'? Why would he give it up in the first place? So many questions!Because I'm nitpicking, the other thing that irritated me were the weird camera angles. There were some odd zoom ins of Mr Han that were really forced and just didn't fit in.In summary, if you've got a few hours to spare you might as well watch it, seeing as each episode is only between 10-20 minutes. It's fairly average but enjoyable enough for a quick binge on Netflix so worth giving it a shot.", "Initially Nightmare Teacher (or Nightmare High) seems like your typical highschool drama but after the first episode it becomes clear that the story is far more deep and innovative. The plot focuses on personal desires of young people whether it may be popularity, appearance, intelligence etc and the consequences of not being content.Teachers are meant to lead us along the right path through learning, in some circumstances the only way for one to learn is through experience and consequence and Nightmare High explores this concept in a fantastic meaningful way.There is a light element of horror mixed in with some mystery. By the end of the series you are sure to have more questions instead of answers, particularly about the antihero. The ending of the series is left largely open to interpretation where the viewer will try to piece together everything and come up with their own unique conclusions. It also stuck with me for a few days!I thoroughly enjoyed Nightmare High and I hope a second season is being considered. Perhaps with a lot more focus on the mysterious antihero.

First, I like the pace of film, well balanced. Secondly, in this drama are a few scenes filmed from many angles, I like enormous that is not a lazy filming technique.

Thirdly and the most importance for me is Eun-Sung's acting (actress Shin Rin-Ah): I'm in awe how the filming team managed a child, clever indeed, to perform a lot of brilliant scenes, to sustain long dialogues.

It tells us about how people try to enjoy life with their loved ones despite all the troubles in life .", "The summery of this one is deceptive as it tells the story of a poor girl marrying a rich guy.In actuality this series focuses on the characters misery with lingering shots on each actor as they cry (not the sexy Hollywood cry with just tears, these are full blown wails with chest beating and voice getting choked in your throat cries) throw tantrums and lash out at each other with every ounce of venom they can muster.The plot is pretty basic and story wise there isn't much beyond what's in the summery however each actor, even minor roles that were given nothing, make their part feel more like a real human than a character on screen.This drama has the best child actors I've seen in any series Korean or otherwise in the role of Eun-Sung. She was amazing and should be included as a main role herself.I can't recommend this one easily as it aims to break your heart and is the first korean drama I've seen with a devastatingly sad ending. More so because they got you to care about these characters each and every single one. Watch with a big pint of ice cream and a box of tissues on stand by!", "This was my first Korean drama and I binged it in one weekend. Although it's quite lengthy sometimes you get quickly attached to the 2 main characters and how the cold hearted playboy falls for those 2 ladies. I was so eager to see how things were going to unfold given the fact that we learn the leading lady had a terminal illness from the get go. Lovely story and the little girl gives an awesome performance.", "Ive seen this drama a couple of times. this drama makes u laugh and cry a lot, mostly cry a lot. Both lee seo jin and Uee and eun sung have emoted superbly. id give this drama a shot any day.", "It is not so sad in term of a sad ending. Female lead has serious illness, under treatment, but are together with the male lead. Male lead is in fact quite old. But as i went on with the drama i came to be in love with his acting. And it is also rare for female lead to be a single mother to have a child. Given all these background, my expectation is not high at all.But it happens to be a quite a romantic drama. Female lead's daughter is very cute. Lead couple successfully create a chemistry. The only kiss at the end of the drama is sweet. I feel relieved that they finally stay together, in spite of the serious illness the female lead has contracted. \nThis is not a typical kdrama, but i am sure you will like it.", "I don't usually watch films that are very sad but this one was different . Make no mistake I cried almost every episode but it was also very heartwarming and so well acted with messages of such selfless love through adversity. The main actress was brilliant so much so that you forgot she was acting and her daughter was just adorable. Loved the character progression and glimpse into life in Korea. Very different to Hollywood programs/films and found myself thinking about it for weeks after watching. Truly touched my heart."], "389": [], "390": [], "391": [], "392": [], "393": ["The drama is a full dose of entertainment. The comedy is light-hearted and fun, the action is well placed and very well choreographed. The characters are diverse, flawed and aware of their own flaws. I absolutely adored the main female lead, as she channels an older, thuggish man. At more than a fair few places in the drama, I was laughing out loud like a maniac. The only thing that didn't work for me was the ending.\nAnyone who is looking for a good drama to keep you busy for a good few days should definitely give this one a try.", "A comedy that deals with after life issues and family drama. Though the comedy part wasn't that good and eventually it was overshadowed, not to say overlapped by the family drama, the drama was quite interesting, and in a way entertaining. The story centres around two men, who have died and come back in different bodies, one as a successful young man and the other as a young woman. Their aim is to help their families, while they keep their true identities hidden. Okay, first, the positives of this drama: -the leading lady was amazing in her role as a man reincarnated in a woman's body. Her role was comical as well as dynamic, and she was really good in acting with her \"ex lover\". -some parts were funny -the family dynamics were really touching Now, for the negative: -the final episode was so-so with the main characters just ending their mission -the guy's obsession with his wife. I mean, from one point on, it was tiring -the twists were unnecessary So, all in all, a so-so drama, so 5 out of 10."], "394": ["This is a romance for the ages. The chemistry is profound. The season is too long and there are some roll your eyes moments but the rest is perfect. The girl plays hard to get but I have a feeling this is a cultural thing. Overall, if you want to see a great romantic comedy with mesmerizing leads this won't fail.", "It's an inspired Korean television production, with an enjoyable romantic plot, well written dialogue, good acting and adequate budget. As of April 2016 it has been streamed more than 2.3 billion times and its Asian success is so huge that China's Ministry of Public Security posted an official (and threatening) statement to warn against the growing influence of Korean Dramas on Chinese youth.It's obviously for kids but it can be interesting for anyone willing to know how is it to live now in South Korea, what does it mean to be pretty, young and cool there.But besides that, the story is catching and well made, with pleasant moments, nice sceneries (a great part has been shot in Greece) and good attention for details. Interestingly, Authors felt the need to account for the age difference between the beautiful Song Hye-kyo (born 1981) and the handsome Song Joong-ki (born 1985), even though I wonder how many of us would have noticed\u0085 I'm liking it and I think that others from Western Countries will like it too.", "This drama has a little bit of everything in it: romance, action, adventure, drama, and comedy! I will definitely watch it again. Great storyline, awesome cast, beautiful soundtrack.\nIt couldn't have been more enjoyable!!! Definitely one of my favorites and a fine example for why I love watching Korean drama! Watch it. You won't be disappointed.", "One of the most well written and beautifully shot Korean dramas, amazing and fresh plot and we'll built characters and satisfying ending.one of the best shows and detailed writing work I ever seen in the WORLD.", "The title song was what I heard first, which made me search for 'Descendants of the Sun' and read the plot which didn't have much to offer apart from a usual romance story. The person who showed me the song was speaking very highly of the drama and was even generous enough to provide the episodes. Then I started watching in gratitude mostly and to be honest, I didn't regret that for a moment - but the opposite!'Tae-yang-eui hoo-ye' belongs to the type of drama that carry a simple story but with its emotional scenes, heartwarming music and soft touches makes it remarkable and attaching to a viewer. It has powerful sub plots running alongside and the visuals including the cast as well as the venues are also an eye candy.What I liked the most in the story is not the main love story between Shi-Jin 'big boss' and Mo-Yeon - 'the lady doctor' (although it is also emotionally appealing) but the power struggle and the demanding relationship between Dae-Yong and Myeong-Joo. I beleive the actors playing those two roles have done more justice to the roles compared to the main duo. But overall the story is empowered and flows nicely with typical lover quarrels and romantic moments placed perfectly between occasional humor and action. Yes you read right, Action ! \nI'm not talking about the Adrenalin rush you might have felt when Myeong-Joo's recording was played on loudspeaker which was a much needed breakthrough that came with humor. But there were plenty of military scenes and rescue scenarios I was very happy to watch as a boy. One more reason to drop a star in the rating is the poor budget that the producers have got when they have such nice action scenes which are diluted with careless visual effects and props.But overall this drama is excellent as a love story because it has the perfect blend between pain-joy, hope-disappointment and expectations-reality which is true in a real world love story as well. Yes, there are some over exaggerated moments of romance or maybe action, but it is essential for us to bond with the characters, hope them to do things that we want and to take pleasure in them getting what we want( and occasionally not getting it to break 'our' hearts). It is indeed an emotional roller coaster ride for a spectator and I really liked it. Anybody with a heart , anybody who have loved before can relate to at least one small incident that happens between the couples in the drama and indulge in their own memories - which can be eventually painful - but we embrace that pain with love.The only exceptional and unnatural character developments that I saw are of the rich-kid doctor and the unearthly attractive tech-mech-doc guy. But that is tolerable ~ it's fun. It also had its emotional moments with bitter truths of life - like when the disaster struck power plant worker took a decision about his life, which is a nice touch additional to the romance, comedy and action in the story.So to sum up (+) typical but rich romantic scenes(+) humor that doesn't bore you(+) picturesque backgrounds ( I didn't know Urk was at Greece right till the end :/ )(+) last but not the least ~ Awesome music(-) can be improved action scenes(-) a bit more less filler plotsmakes 'Descendants of the Sun' a nice story to watch and a pleasant gift to share.\nPersonally I enjoyed a lot watching the sweet romance and love struggles in a drama - which I thought I might never do again. So I would like to thank the person who shared this beautiful work of art with me for giving me the taste of a locked out world. :)", "It's the first Korean Drama I have watched & I can watch it again it's so lovely and heart Warming. Beautiful love story of a soldier and Doctor.There are moments in the show when you just want to fall in love all over once again. Both the love stories is being depicted beautifully. The struggle they face in the path to love is what makes it a beautiful watch. Here they don't have the fear of other person cheating but fear that they might be anytime dead. There is love, romance, comedy, emotions and also action. A complete package.\nSometimes you feel for the characters. The performance of each actor be it main protagonists or the side characters is awesome. You fall in love with each one of them. Direction is good. Background score & the songs are beautiful.\nOn the whole a must must watch...", "This drama is not just aesthetically gorgeous- the cinematography is seriously nothing short of a masterpiece- but also carries a message that is just as beautiful. This is one of the most critically acclaimed dramas of time, with special praise given to the the heart tugging storyline and the beautiful layered performances from the strong cast.", "I am inlove with this serries. Simply amazing..beautiful actors, funny, charming, captivating scenery and excelent script. Oh and the soundtrack..makes my heart melt. Please make Season 2! Pleaseeee!", "Descendants of the Sun is one of those epic series that pretty much has it all: action, comedy, dire moments, touching moments, heart- breaking moments, suspense, intrigue, romance, and some dynamite plot- twists to satisfy most viewers.The series tells the story of a South Korean special forces officer, Yoo Shi-Jin (wonderfully portrayed by Joong-ki Song) and the civilian medical doctor, Kang Mo-Yeon (Hye-Kyo Song), whom he develops feelings for. So, how does a man, whose job is to take lives in order to protect others, makes a relationship work with a woman who is sworn to save lives, no matter who they are or what they've done? That is one of the central themes of the series as well as Dr. Mo-Yeon's constant grappling with her heart over a man who is always putting his life on the line. Joong-ki Song brings a wit and charm to the very likable Yoo Shi-Jin. He never takes things too seriously except when the people he cares about are in danger. He has a wonderful sense of humor. He, and best friend, Sergeant Seo Dae-Young, seem to get into trouble a fair amount, leading to some fairly humorous situations. The equally charismatic Dr. Mo-Yeon is a woman dedicated to her work. She has dreams of becoming a professor but quickly finds herself in a situation that sends her and her medical team to volunteer in the war- torn fictional country of Uruk. What makes Descendants of the Sun special is that it never gets bogged down in melodrama. It never takes itself too seriously, but delves just deep enough to care about the characters and what might become of them. While there are a few tense situations, the series is equally light-hearted and, most of all, sweet. I can see why so many people around the world have quickly become enamored with the series as well as with its characters. There are enough moments to make you laugh, make you cry, as well as make you wonder and hope if it is possible for two characters in seemingly opposing professions to be together. It's a fascinating character study into this dynamic. I have only recently gotten into some Japanese and Korean shows, and for me, Descendants of the Sun is easily my favorite. In fact, after over 40 years of watching TV shows, I put this one up among the very best that I've ever seen.", "They say they are going to create a season 2 of this show without the main leads (son song couple). I do not know why they are doing that because the whole point of the show is about those two and that is why it is so interesting and fun to watch. If the two are not going to be the leads and apart of the show for season 2 and the rest of the seasons. There is no point in making the show anymore. You say that there schedules are busy if their schedule are busy start making season 2 when their schedules are not busy does not matter if it takes a while. I rather see them be the leads again than not see them at all in season 2 in the rest of the seasons.", "I would give it 12 out of 10 if possible. It was a shock to find a Korean TV series on Netflix. Haven't lived in Korea since 1967. Not like the people I recall, but it's easy to become attached to these characters. Plots are like the Snake River: 6\" deep and a mile wide. The acting is often stilted and a major stretch, but at times the crew just bust out some great acting chops. Even though they all look like kids. It's cool hearing all the Korean and trying to catch words I understand. Too bad more scenes weren't shot in Korea to see what it looks like today. But the shots around Greece are beeeeeeutiful! Hard to keep up with acting and plot while reading text. Some characters are more like caricatures, especially the Captain. We have two Romeos and two Juliettes with a bunch of capable actors filling out the crew. Right down to the injured plant manager advising the doc to save the man with a forklift tine through his chest. Excellent cinematography, color, and site selections. They display the soldiers like the \"hard ROK troops\" I knew. But these have hearts and obvious feelings. Right down to the funny doc asking a nurse to delete his porn file on his laptop if he dies...which causes a middle age nurse to come unglued because files are dirty. Yes, a stretch. But the Korean mentality is unlike our American mentality in many ways. Must admit I love the Korean people (in general) today as much as I did when I lived there and served with the military. Too bad the North and South can't get along. This is one pretty series! My wife doesn't understand my attachment to the country, people, and my desire to see Korea again, but this series brings it all back. So well made. \"Power in Unity!\"", "This is an excellent series. It has a great story line and good actors. The action sequences and the humour interlaced in the plot, keeps it interesting. The main characters leave a lasting impression. I'm not really fond of kdramas, but watched this one based on the amazing reviews it had. I thoroughly enjoyed this one, totally worth watching even with the subtitles.", "What an amazing well written story of love, duty, friendship, family... follow the stories of 6-12 people I think, only at Ep 15 now 6-4-2016, WOW!! So amazing! Love the Afghanistan mine clearing and medical episodes, the drama of ep 13 nd 14 - but of course I love the romance. The wheelchair scene in ep 14 amazingly perfect for the characters! Violence (just war type) and swearing, few kisses, no sex of course. Perfect for whole family. Major conversation starters.Subtitles are amazing clear to read and sometimes not needed. So glad I found this series! Really good for history buffs 9 stars out of 10.", "I watched it and it's seriously addictive!! I haven't seen a lot of war dramas so I can't scale it or compare it, but I can tell it's got a good plot and characters. This is the type of drama that has potential and the writers know how to fully unlock that; hopefully they'll even surpass my expectations. The story flow is great so far, with emotional yet playful chemistry between the two leads. Can't wait to see how this will turn out :).The chemistry between the leads are just so good. But I have this bittersweet feeling; definitely something tragic is about to happen and idk if my heart can handle it . I hope they don't bring some IsIs sh*t in to this drama or calls the afghans terrorists cuz' we've had enough of that already and there is no reason to confuse people even more.", "I don't know why this became such a mega-hit, even bigger than You Who Came from the Stars. For me, the story did not really keep me engaged. I only watched it to see why people loved it so much. Yes, the cinematography was superb. The leads were also great and personally, I like both of them and have seen their other dramas before. At least, the woman is not the usual Cinderella character and the man is not Prince Charming CEO type. However, the story of these two leads did not capture my interest. At least with You Who Came from the Stars, the story between the lead characters and the crime/thriller subplot were gripping enough to make me continue watching, though I did not like the way they ended the drama. I was not personally invested in DOTS despite the good lead actors. I know that many loved their looks and chemistry but for me it will take more than looks and chemistry to keep me interested. Even with YWCFS, I couldn't care less about the chemistry between the two leads but the alien concept and the crime/thriller aspect of the drama made a bit more interested. The story between the two leads in DOTS could have been better. For example, the soldier had to kill someone close to the doctor because he or she was a spy but the doctor needed to save that person because not only was that person dear to her but she had to save lives as a doctor---well, something like that to make the dilemma more interesting and gripping.", "Descendants of the sun (DOTS) is absolutely my favorite kdrama and is what got me hooked onto kdramas. There are several reasons for this - spectacular locations with great cinematography, amazing soundtrack and the perfect cast. The cast was especially impressive in their acting abilities and none of the actors disappointed. This is one of the few Korean shows where the subplots are just as enjoyable as the main story. The pacing is also good and I did not need to skip through any of the scenes. Although there are a few implausible moments, it is a riveting drama and definitely worth watching (preferably on a marathon)! I would give it a 9.5/10, mainly because it is exceptional in its genre.", "A brilliant drama. War, earthquake, surgery, romance, exotic scenery.....a feast for our eyes. Nowhere to breathe. Simply excellent.", "It is hard to review what is perhaps the most successful Korean Drama ever.This is a grand romance comedy drama action all rolled into one series. It became a phenomenon in Korea and across Asia and the \"Kdrama\" world. In the process reviving the \"Hallyu\" Korean wave and generating a massive wave of tourism to Korea, recruits for the Korean army and even impacting vernacular speech in Korea.So how do you review such a massive blockbusting success?It begins with a genuinely heartstopping action sequence that will become a key element in the resolution of the drama and then switches to a typical Korean romantic comedy. Boy meets girl... girl instantly hates him... but we all know how it will end.Our hero is a special forces soldier and our heroine is doctor. Fate sees them thrown into a war torn fictitious country (actually locations were in Greece in some rather stunning locales).There is, as is usual a buddy to our hero who has relationship with the general's daughter and father does not approve. You know the sort of thing.Descendants of the Sun is not that original in its plotting but it has heart on a giant scale and a cast the is exemplary.And fate threw in a bonus that no-one could foresee. The genuinely beautiful Song Hye Kyo and her co-star the handsome Song Joong Ki fell in love ultimately marrying in 2017.Despite the sometimes trite story line and the unlikely elements in the plotting at its core it is a love story. And this is what becomes more and more genuine as the series progresses.It is the key romantic scenes between the two leads (and also those of the second couple of Goo Jin and Kim Ji-won) that set the screen alight.The scriptwriters have created dialogue that rings true and the actors bring it to life brilliantly. At times funny at times deeply romantic it is this that lifts Descendants of the Sun way above the ordinary and certainly above much that Hollywood has produced recently.So sit back and let the story flow and just enjoy the romance, the comedy (which is at times really funny and I don't find Korean humour usually that funny) and the action which is pretty intense at times.Descendants of the Sun is a great ride.And the ending? Well let's just say Vancouver and volcanos take some beating!", "Love Song Song Couple. Their chemistry is absolutely good. \nTheir acting was perfect. Song Ji Hyo is look like a real doctor.\nBut the ending was dissapointing", "Short Review: Great story that revolves around the army, and it was a bit emotional too (not full on bawling, but makes me look up to people who serve in themilitary). Hope you can see it!Longer Review: This Korean drama was excellent. This may seem cheesy giving it a 10 out of 10, but I really think this show deserves this rating. I love action with a bit of romance, so this show was perfect for me. The setting includes the army, and the words that comes out of the soldier's mouth seems to be written by an actual soldier, making it emotional (not full on bawling, but for me it makes me look up to people who serve in the army). I hope you can watch it soon!", "I watched this because it was recommended after watching Mr Sunshine. While I did not find the story line as interesting as Mr Sunshine I thought the acting, sets and production values were every bit as good. Yes, it was contrived at times but the story had a good mix of humor, romance, adventure, happiness and sadness. I thought the chemistry between the different romantic partners was very good, in fact the two main leads get married in real life.I think best of all was that it had an happy ending. I was actually able to smile at the end of the show rather than having tears. So different than the other Asian dramas I have watched. Definitely recommended to anyone who enjoys a good romantic story. It is worth reading the sub titles.", "It's quiet frustrating me how the situation is a bit complicated. This is over the top dramatic but at the same it's flipping good you won't regret shedding tears for it. The chemistry of joong ki and hye-kyo in a scale of 1 to 10 would be 7 like they aren't that bad but they aren't that good neither but to top it all the story is good.", "I want to congratulate the production team director, writers, writers, actors and others who participated in the making of something that was wonderful. Since I saw her in the first seconds is hooked to the screen there is nothing wrong with criticizing or commenting but only admiring an excellent story.With respect to the rumors of the second season, that if there is not a second season as I clarify to all who read this criticism that it is not safe a second release of descendants of the sun, but there is a small possibility, since its end Was very open and a future a little uncertain in life characters that would not hurt badly a second season, but it is noteworthy that the plot would not be the same because practically all the best left in the first and to make a new argument and a New plot will be a little complicated but not impossible to do it, also the last word and decision is the direct. If more to say I thank the reader who took minutes of his time to read this criticism.", "Descendants of the sun is one of the most discussed drama and everyone seemed to go all crazy about it. Maybe that's why I expected too much out of it and got quite disappointed. First of all the romance between the doctor and the soldier was clever, but it wasn't strong enough for me. Actually the second lead romance was better, but anyway. The big tragedies that occurred during the drama were okay, especially the last one which ended up in a big twist, it was good enough to make the second last episode very entertaining. However, the drama after a while got to be more of a long advertisement than a TV series. The performances were okay, I guess, and the scenery was really good, along with the soundtrack. So, all in all, 3 out of 10.", "The story is good with good cast. The starting episodes I felt it boring but towards episode - 5,6 it took a turn. The first lead pair chemistry I did not feel it as great as people say instead I would prefer second lead chemistry. The lead actress was shown and told as some angel or Cinderella but i did not feel that. Some of the episodes in the middle were bit boring and draggy. I loved the attitude of the villain David. I expected too much from this drama because of its high rating and all but it was not to that point. It was talked more than dramas like You who came from the stars, Healer, etc.... Due to these things I expected too much from this drama and felt a bit disappointed. Somewhere deep down the line is felt the story was predictable except the last episode. The OST of the drama was super. I would give it a 7/10 rating for storyline."], "395": [], "396": [], "397": [], "398": [], "399": [], "400": [], "401": [], "402": [], "403": [], "404": ["Normally, i don't bother to write review, but I need to tell everyone how awesome this TV series is. This is the first TV series that didn't make me bored or sleepy while watching it, it's full of suspense and unpredictable plot. It also plays with your emotion, i fell happy, sad, scared, angry, desperate while watching this series.It's how good this series is, it's really draining my brain. I need to think while watching signal, even after i have finished watching it, i am still thinking about it. When I cannot move on even though i have finished watching it, then the movie is a really good one.sorry but i think SIGNAL is better than game of thrones hahaha, you should watch it. Don't miss this great series.", "This is one of the most well thought/well executed TV-series i have ever watched and not just by k-drama standards. The premise is innovative, the characters and their relationships very well fleshed out and the suspense present from the very first to the very last scene.It just never gets boring and every episode matters. This is a story that seemingly begins in the year 2000 when a young Park Hae Young witnesses a girl getting kidnapped. The case remains unsolved as Park Hae Young's attempts to explain what really happened to the police are met with indifference.That in combination with a case very personal to Park Hae Young are enough to make him mistrust the police and the transparency of their procedures. He grows up to become a criminal profiler and one day he crosses paths with detective Cha Soo Hyun. Cha Soo Hyun has spent the last fifteen years looking for her missing partner Detective Lee Jae Han who was facing criminal charges for bribery/extortion. After 15 years of no trace we finally get a clue of what happened to Jae Han when through his old, non-functioning walkie talkie he communicates with an understandably confused Park Hae Young. Jae Han from the year 2000 reports that this will probably be his last transmission, that the past can still change and that Park Hae Young just has to convince Jae Han from 1989. And that is how a strange partnership who evolves into a caring and close friendship that transcends time begins. I cannot describe properly how much i love this show and the main characters who despite their tragic pasts never give up (which is the main teaching of the story) and continue to fight forward through a system of injustice so that other people will get to have what they themselves had been denied.All three of them were hardened by life but never lost their humanity and their ability to care. Their relationships also make me SO emotional. Especially the unusual friendship between Park Hae Young and Lee Jae Han who until the very end never meet properly and yet they grow to love each other so much.For me the most powerful and downright heartbreaking scene was when (MAJOR SPOILERS) they were both going (again seemingly) through their final moments and we had a flashback to their dialogue when each wished that the other would be happy. Ofc the romantic sl was also beautiful. Very subtle and yet so important. Cha Soo Hyun waiting/searching for the love of her life for 15 years to finally be the one who will motivate Jae Han to fight for his life. Like..kill me now, let them get married and adopt Park Hae Young...or sth. I just want them to be a family, okay? Also the evil guy!Kim Boo Joo. What an excellent casting choice for sb to play the DEVIL reincarnated (like for real, he's evil through and through). Every time i saw him on my screen, i was overwhelmed by the need to beat him to the death with a stick (the show did NOT disappoint me in that part either!). I think this review is getting somewhat incoherent but it's just because i love this so much, i have no words! So forgive me. And watch the show! Which def needs a season 2.", "Why do people of South Korea under rate their movies, TV-series so much? Why? Believe me when I say \"If this show was made in Hollywood, It's rating would have been 9.5 or above\". The amount of thriller provided in just the first four episodes is higher than the aggregate amount of thriller provided by all five seasons of TV series like Breaking Bad. I have watched every good Hollywood movie and TV- series, but I have never reviewed anything, This is my first review and it is coming for a South Korean drama, but the irony is I just don't have words to explain how I feel after watching this show. I am Speechless. I feel so bad when I see that there are not even 500 votes here. These directors, actors and the whole production team needs to be appreciated. They are giving us so much, I can't find ways to thank them. Why the world is living in ignorance? These 18 hours are right here, which can give them a next level thrilling experience. If someone by chance is reading this review, please do yourself a favor and watch this drama.", "SPOILER: This was an insanely amazing show. From the plot, to the cinematography, to the characters, it was all top-notch. I was hooked and at the edge of my seat throughout all the episodes. The way they weaved the plots from past and present, and used the right amount of suspense to keep us wondering and speculating, were masterful. This is my top series of 2016! (along with Broadchurch, which I only watched in 2016 when it came out on Netflix lol)I'm glad it ended the way it did too - ambiguous and with the promise of more to come. Even if they don't have a series 2, it's perfect the way it is.", "This is first Korean Drama i watched and i am really glad that i did.. This is my review of any thing. I have watched many English TV shows but after a while they change story or no longer are exited compare to first episodes. but this is on whole another new level..Everything is just amazing story,acting,suspense. Writer just created her own new world.. I could feel, how characters felt for each other in this show.. nothing was forced or dragged too long.. I highly recommend this who is reading this.. Even at the last episodes, last minute i couldn't guess what was going to happen this is masterpiece of thriller genre.. and also soundtracks wow just amazing every music in this was amazing.. i really wish this was longer than just only 16 episodes..", "I watched Signal out of curiosity due to time/science fiction element written in the synopsis but it opened up much further to the excellent acting, plot and story line signal could offer. I wonder if Hollywood would learn a thing or two from this series to produce a different new level of story telling. Will they be releasing season 2 soon? I look forward to it almost anxiously. Will they not do so? I believe with the 16 episodes they aired had made many who watched Signal to expectantly wait if the producers would decide to continue. Its like two parallel earths - one past, the other present. Both worlds connected by a doorway of time. Past changed because of the present and present changes due to the past.", "A unique spin to time travel. Solid drama with detectives solving crimes in two time periods. With each episode, you learn a little more why it is that those two detectives are the ones communicating through this magic walkie-talkie. When this series ended, I was left wanting so much more!", "This emotionally rich drama chronicles the life of three individuals whose lives are intertwined. The screenplay which realistically beautiful,especially how the characters interact,allows a smooth flow for the narration. Lonely melancholic characters which are perfectly written and easily relatable is one of the aspects that upholds my emotional connection with the film. Sad to see that it is criminally underrated.", "Excellent drama. Although for me it could have been cut by an episode or two. I just felt it dragged a little bit around episode 15. but it picked around the time of what I will term The WAKE UP sequence. as for the acting, There are 3 performances which I considered excellent. But It wasn't the the three leads. it was two of the leads. Kim Hye Soo and Jo Jin Woong. Although I would give him the nod over her. The the third excellent performance is a cameo. but an important role. It's Son Hyun Joo who excludes menace. as for the the third lead Lee Je Hoon. Hmm. I'm not sure. He just seems to have the same expression on his face for most of the drama, kind of like sad and dazed. Also why did he not play the younger version of himself, as Kim Hye Soo did. Did the makers feel he hadn't got the range. I also appreciate the drama doesn't forsake the humour element. Although by an large it's a serious drama, there are some very funny sequences. There are some moments i really enjoyed eg the finding of the picture sequence, the cooking sequence. But my favourite was a sequence where Kim Hye Soo gives a handkerchief to a victim of a Casanova type. But she has a present (can't remember what) for the guy she loves. I think it falls out of her pocket, and the look on her face as she checks to see that nobody has seen it is priceless. Like", "This show is practically flawless! Seriously my favorite TV show ever.

The characters change throughout the series, and you grow to like them, then dislike them, then like them again. And that, I think, is the best part about this series and it makes it unique. Also, it keeps the interest high, as, unlike other dramas that the story concludes at about the 14th episode, cheese in the trap keeps it interesting till the end, with a nice final episode that doesn't stick with the patterns of tacky romance.

It was to realistic. As much as it was about Yu Jong and Seol's love, it was about the growth of their characters. Not just their but Baek In Ha and Baek In Ho too. The story was more realistic than anything that I have ever seen. Honestly, I was all tears the moment I realized he was going to leave her for her own sake but somewhere I understood him probably because I identify my nature with Seol way too much. Just like her, I had hope it will work out and he will come back.

It felt like I got my boyfriend back. I don't why people think the ending isn't good and that it isn't solid enough because if you'll look at it in a different light, the second male lead had a strong character because his story is equally important and thus, the story isn't just a love story or a love triangle, it was about the growth of people who contained their anger, who contained their feelings and who felt alone and never told anyone. The story wasn't about \"LOVE CONQUERS ALL\" it was about \"ACCEPT YOUR TRUE SELF\".I was so happy when Seol hugged Yoo Jong after that Sang Chul incident at the company when the guy had tears in his eyes that was so real. I kind of really think that this someone's real story because you can't nail such emotions so well. Like the way Yoo Jong behaved when Seol first bought gift for him, He was so surprised and touched that he couldn't understand how to react and was so taken aback in his own feelings and then when he hugged her it was just so pure.

This is a great show.As my title implies, I'm an old school (and old) rocker from the prior century. The concept of the boy band, when it first appeared in the 80s with the likes of New Kids on the Block, was an affront to my existence. And I was also somewhat skeptical of the K-pop and J-pop scenes, and I couldn't imagine that a prettyboy band could be nearly as funny as \"Spinal Tap\" with its raw, ridiculous, flat out nuts musicians. But read on...\"You're Beautiful\", despite its less-than-sensational title, has some of the weirdest characters imaginable. And that's what makes it hilariously entertaining for musicians and non-musicians alike. My favorite character is \"Kang\", the creepy gothboy lead singer who is a germophobe (fear of dirt), agoraphobe (fear of crowds), haphephobe (fear of being touched), ataxophobe (fear of disorder), and on top of it all he's afraid of the dark, too. Despite all this, he maintains a facade of \"cool\" and absolute control which he asserts in a most tyrannical way over the others. Second in command is \"Hwang\" the lead guitarist who is the antithesis of the singer. He is a gentle, wise, friendly Buddha type person who seems better suited for monkhood than a pop band. Bringing up the bottom is \"Jeremy\" the drummer. Alas, poor drummers. They are always portrayed as the dimmest tube in the amp, and Jeremy is no exception. So thick that he can barely count to 4 to bring in the band, Jeremy is a refreshing gust of pure comic relief who balances out the moments of heavy drama (and despite this being a breezy comedy, there can be some heavy moments). And of course there's our hero/heroine \"Go Mi Nam\" who is exactly the way you'd expect a teenage nun to be, having been forced to masquerade as a boy in the nation's top pop band.That brings me to the plot which you probably know already, but I'll recap: A teenage nun ends up masquerading as a boy in the nation's top pop band. But don't let the simplicity of that premise fool you. At times it gets surprisingly complicated and suspenseful, bringing to mind classic tales like Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" which revolve around the hilarity and complexity of cross-dressing. And just as powerful as the funny moments, there are also deeply emotional moments which might elicit a tear from even the most hardened heavy metal rocker. OK, I admit I bawled like a baby twice in 5 episodes. Stop smirking.The overall presentation is cute and family-friendly. But at the same time there are gags that appeal to the adults amongst us. In one episode there's a scene involving the girl using ping pong balls to, how do I say... simulate manhood, and it had me choking with laughter for a solid 2 minutes.I also must say a word about the actual music. I really like it. It's infectious, played well, and the actors even look like they're really playing their instruments. If you're like me, you might be sick of TV & movies where the actors look like they're holding a limp squid rather than a guitar. Well these actors are good enough to fool me.So there you have it, nothing but high praise from me. I'm already sad that it's going to end, but at the same time I imagine this is the kind of show I'd want to watch over & over. Other band based comedies I highly recommend are \"Swing Girls\" (Japanese) about a group of misfits teen girls trying to play jazz, \"A Mighty Wind\" about a hilarious bunch of freaks playing folk music, \"Music & Lyrics\" starring Hugh Grant & Drew Barrymore with some riotous references to 80s pop, and the aforementioned mofo of all musical movies, \"This Is Spinal Tap\".

This is not Coffee Prince. d) Catchy pop tunes. e) Final declaration of love is satisfying.What I didn't like: a) Villains' manipulations went on too long from the characters Yoo He Yi (Uee) and Tae Kyung's mother (Kim Sung Ryung). I wish these characters had been defanged earlier in the series. b) Go Mi Nam's aunt (Choi Ran) did not appeal to me.

Does it live into its hype? Yes,it does. The plot alone is reasonable enough to live into it. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST ROMANTIC Asian DRAMAS EVER MADE!!!Although it does have some similarities with another great drama entitled,\"The First Shop Of The Coffee Prince\", the story is fresh, original and one-of-a- kind.

Its a favorite of mine and I've watched it more than once. The characters in this show are well written and well acted.Go Mi-Nyu / Go Mi-Nam: Park Shin-Hye did a great job acting as Mi- Nyu Though it bothered me greatly how weak the character was in personality. Go Mi-Nyu / nam, was quite a nervous wreck for parts of the show but who wouldn't be in that kind of situation? I really loved the chemistry between Mi-Nyu and Tae-Kyeong. I was in suspense throughout the show wondering when Go Mi-nyu's secret was going to be revealed.Hwang Tae-Kyeong: Jang Keun Suk is an amazing actor, he pulled off the arrogant, cold, emotionally wounded germophobe leader very well. Tae-Keyong has many different phobias like the fear of being touched, fear of the dark. Tae-Kyeong can be quite the jerk but hes got some sweet moments too.Jeremy: Lee Hong-Ki did a good job as Jeremy the bubbly playful fun loving best friend type of guy in the group. There is never a dull moment with Jeremy on screen. Unfortunately for Jeremy hes not the brightest. Jeremy is a relief during the heavier parts of the drama. Yes there is some kind of heavy parts. Though the drama is balanced out well with emotions.Kang Shin-woo: Jung Yong-Hwa killed me playing Shin-woo. I fell head over heels for his character. Shin-woo is a very mature, wise, kind, sweet and caring character always supporting Go Mi-Nyu / Nam. The actor does a killer \"you just kicked a puppy infront of me\" face the feels from that is just too much for me. He has some pretty killer outfits in the show too. It came as a surprise to me that Jung Yong- Hwa wasn't just a good singer but also a good actor too.You don't really need me to summarize the story again so I'll just give my thoughts instead.Now you may think it would be a pretty teen centered fangirling drama as its a teenage nun in a all male pop band but You're beautiful has its own special charm. Its got a lot of jokes in it but has heartbreaking moments as well. The storyline stays on a straight path, it doesn't go to a giant mess like some dramas I've watched they stay true to their story.I cried a few times with this show, I bawled like a baby at how romantic the last episode was. I ended up shouting at my screen a few times as well even though I know the characters can't hear me. I got so into it that the drama become lodged deep in the depths of my heart and I reacted out loud without realizing half the time.I thought it'd just appeal to fangirls / boy crazy teens when I went to watch it. But I honestly don't think that way after watching it. Its a drama that sucks you in and you want to watch episode after episode.Though there is a bit of fanservice for the girls (mmm shirtless shin woo) I mean what? I said nothing shh don't tell anyone I know.I think if it was us in Mi-Nyu's shoes we'd have a hard time picking with how amazing all three guys personalities are. (even though Tae- Kyeong can be a jerk he can win a girls heart when hes not so cold.) Honestly I doubt Mi-Nyu could of picked if it was real life and not a show, because they are all wonderful. (I probably would be swayed to shin-woo though)This show I think is perfect for lonely people or maybe just me but it lifted my spirits when I was down I think that has got to count for something right?The music in this show is wonderful, the music always fits with the scenes perfectly. When it comes to the actors actually playing instruments it looks real. Well real enough to fool the average person I don't know if it'd fool someone who knows instruments well.Anyway that ends my first IMDb review.

Plus the whole girl dresses up as a boy is very interesting and common theme for many dramas, as it makes it entertaining for the audience with the thrill of finding her out and all the goofiness that follows her tries to keep her identity hidden. The awkward moments were too many, especially in the beginning, with the lead actress making a total fool of her self in any way possible. The weakest points of this drama, however, was the music, as the same songs were being repeated over and over (the drama the entertainer did the same, though it contained more songs in its soundtrack).

Bidding farewell to Reply 1988 continues this list, as I venture onward in dramaland and away from Ssammungdong. I say goodbye to that warm, neighborly feeling, that old nostalgia, that stirup-pant wearing era, and to the best youth drama I have ever seen.Reply 1988 outshines its predecessors. The story primarily takes place in a singular setting, and yet the narrative does not stagnate; it does not become boring or trite; it does not make you sleepy when watching daily interactions of the families. Instead, the story of R1988 pushes at the heart and makes you yearn for friends who love each other this closely, for parents who love each other this much, for a life as simple and yet as hard as these characters' lives were. It takes you out of 2015 and 2016 and supplants you into 1988 where you take that same journey with the characters. Perhaps the star of the narrative of R1988 is its ability to exert both laughter and tears at the passing of a few minutes, yet it never feels stilted. It brings us richness and variety of character within just the five friends, let alone the parents and siblings surrounding them. With that, we see intricate details of each person's character--like Bora's unspoken love for her parents, or Dong Ryong's inner philosopher, or Jung Hwan's hidden sweetness, or Taek's competitive strength. There are so many elements of character that we see, often unspoken, rise to the surface with the passing of a quick moment or a prolonged incident.Not only did the narrative of R1988 promote emotions from the viewer, it also brought the winds of unpredictability with it. The writers, in their infinite wisdom, flipped the switch and delivered a romance not built on the standard female lead being the only one in love for the majority of the series nor a male lead who said nothing but ended up the romantic star. It gave the person who stepped up and took a risk the chance to shine (and shine he did- delivering kisses to die for and a sweet chemistry with the lead that was noticeable from the get go). Furthermore, the show gave many couples a chance at love, both new and renewed, lost and found. It was never unrealistic or unfair to anyone in the cast (as some are quick to say); instead, it offered options and chose the best one. The laughter and tears that made me giggle until wheezing and leak all over my crooked glasses came from an illustrious cast. R88's five friends gave their all to show us their characters' fears, tears, love, admiration, consternation, that random move in Baduk, and so much more. I have to hand it to Ryu Joon Yeol and Park Bo Gum; they made me root for both of them and create #TeamPolyamorous as a hashtag. Their performances were so spot on, and a new star was born. Go Kyung Pyo has always been a personal favorite, and as the sweet, slightly nerdy but quite handsome Sun Woo, he once again stole my heart--this time, though, not with laughter so much as with sweetness. Lee Dong Hwi as Dong Ryong was simply adorable; I would like to see more from him. Hyeri's Duk Seon, though the weakest of these performances, was true to Duk Seon's character--bubbly and outgoing, if not a little bit kooky. I could talk all day about the parents' roles as well. Ra Mi Ran, Kim Seon Young, and Lee Il Hwa trumped most drama mothers for being the most awesome trio of moms in a drama. They were not only funny, but they all showed signs of vulnerability and strength, and true to form, they were an unstoppable force on screen and in front of their husbands. Speaking of husbands/dads, all the dads were awesome as well, but Kim Sung Kyun takes the cake. His President Kim routine will forever been ingrained in my memory, but also his relationship with Ra Mi Ran showed a great example of how love grows with age. The music of Reply 1988 also played a special role, not only in the background OST, but in the characters' lives. From Duk Seon trying to win a Walkman to her waiting anxiously outside a concert venue, to Dong Ryong's cover of \"I Just Called to Say I Love You,\" to Ra Mi Ran's special dance, the power of music pervaded the narrative of Reply. It gave us warmth and it made us want to dance along. Even at 1:30 to 2 hours per episode, I'm going to watch this again. I enjoyed it too much and loved it even more. There was never a dull moment in this series, and I will treasure it for a lifetime. However, now it is time to move on--to leave the streets of Ssangmungdong 1988 and flash forward to Dayton 2016. I look at my neighborhood--siding coming off of roofs, puttering old cars emitting exhaust, the paint on the doors of my house chipping, and the possibility that after I leave in a year or so, it may be the last time I see my home of nearly 22 years. It may be the last time I get to say goodbye to my neighborhood, just as it is my time to say goodbye to my youth. For all things considered, the first 28 years have been a good run. That is my Reply.", "Actually, I am not South Korean, even I was not born in 1988. But this drama makes me feel deeply in the same way. I love them all forever.", "Initially, I would have started this review with \"first of all\"... but it would have been inconsistent with the tens of \"first of all\" I'd started with. Why? Because this Korean drama is amazingly accurate in depicting the '85-90's period and idiosyncrasies!... And this appreciation comes from a non-Korean, non-Asian, Hollywood movie-goer, >30's person. Nevertheless, I have never seen a more realistic depiction of common people and their struggles throughout that particular period. I know what I'm talking about because I've experienced it in my neighbourhood and with my family. Because of this and others more, I felt compelled to add my unacquainted review to IMDb.\nBottom line... if you really want to see some great acting (Kudos to the actors!!!) and get an amazing feel of the 85-90's (and this is coming from a non-American, non-Western point of view), I highly recommend this series!", "Obviously the writers tried to make Reply 1988 as an unpredictable story but look how they failed miserably because it was so absurd, unclear with so many unanswered questions and it just put us in so much pain I am pretty sure something odd happened during new year's holiday so they changed the script. I mean, come on, You already built 90% of the story about Dukseon and Junghwan and then you destroyed all those moments, clues, Dukseon's husband personality which was obviously Junghwan, with those 10%? Waenyeol and you did not give him a proper ending. Don't you ever think I'm gonna watch your next project. Finale ruined everything and does not make sense.", "Reply 1988 outshines its predecessors. This drama connects us to the nostalgic memory lane of simpleness of life for average people and emphasizes the camaraderie between families, friends, neighbors & every one. It is correlated with the cultural aspects of the past and shows us the boundaries where one might stopped existing. But this drama helps us relive the past and appreciate the generosity and oneness of humanity. This is a genuine drama that gives moral lessons. It motivates us to be courageous, take care other people, to give love and don't expect anything in return. Made with infinite class.", "I am a Sri Lankan born in 1988. This drama made me revisit the memories of my youth and the relationship we had with our neighbors. Further we were the ones' to use both analog and digital technologies. Miss that easy going lifestyle. It is a must watch for all.", "Sung Dong Il and Lee Il Hwa are back as parents and there are no cameo appearances from the cast of the previous two seasons except of course the obvious presence of Samcheonpo as Jung Hwan's father.\nThe cast in this series was by far the best! From the parents to the kids everybody was SO good!\nThis season too like the previous two tells us the story of a group of friends. These friends live in the same neighborhood and are high school students. This series concentrated on the family more than the love story.\nDuk Sun, Sun Woo, Jung Hwan, Choi Taek and Dong Ryong. I love these characters the best. What with Duk Sun crushing on her friends and feeling lost when she can't figure out her feelings. The Baduk champion Taek who can only play Baduk but can't function like a normal human without some help from his friends. Dong Ryong is the 'counsellor' on the block. He's also the singer and dancer in the group who is constantly getting into trouble with his father who is also the dean at his school! Jung Hwan the dog is so tsundere that it warms your heart. He unlike his friends finds it hard to express himself but when it comes to his family he is always found sitting and pondering over how to make things right. Sun Woo! Sun Woo is the sanest person in group. He takes it upon himself to help his mother and is always there for his little sister Jin Joo who is the cutest little marshmallow on the show.\nThe story revolves around these 5 characters and their respective siblings. It's about a time where parents made their kids take a little something from their table to their neighbors. Back when there were no smart phones and gadgets to keep one occupied.\nThese 5 come up with such fun ways of keeping themselves entertained it is nothing short of nostalgia mixed with a longing for a world when things were much simpler.\nThe only reason why this doesn't get a perfect score is because the guy I was rooting for deserved to be with Duk Sun!", "I loved this one! All the reply shows are very good and so is this one. I loved it so much! The characters and actors were so enjoyable to watch! The storyline was solid throughout and let me just say I love the guessing who she marries part and not revealing it until the end! It sets these series apart from others. Really unique! I'd highly recommend if you enjoy nostalgia shows and Kdrama! And I'm shred you'll enjoy who the girl marries in this one too. Although this one was the toughest one in my opinion on who she chooses. I really loved both guys but the one I had pictured she loved was correct and I was happy but can't help but feel for the second lead. You'll understand what I mean when you watch it.", "When i saw this drama.i'm speechless and it was absolutely make me tears in every episodes.also at first it makes you laughh and then without realize it can make you cry.the song also the best which is lee juck - dont worry my dear.

Every character has flesh and blood. Every sensation can make people cry. It's just a funny story.", "I am a fan of Reply series, all of them are great but I like Reply 1988 the best. It has great OSTs, good cinematography, and superb casts with superb acting skill.This drama focuses on the families' relationship in a not so quiet neighborhood. This drama shows ordinary life of middle-class citizens, with no blockbuster k-dramas clich\u00e9s. There is no evil mother-in-law, sick main lead, or the love line between a poor girl and a rich boy. However, just like its predecessors (Reply 1997 & Reply 1994), it also has a mystery to be solved: \"Who is the female lead's husband?\". Sadly, some people still can't get over their disappointment towards the ending of the drama. I personally like who the girl ended up marrying with tho. If you don't have any curiosity or don't root for any of the male leads to be Deoksun's husband, then you can just watch it as it is. But if in the middle of the drama you change your mind, I suggest you to watch it from episode 1 and look closely to every details (e.g. the dolls or the actors' lines). You might need to read what Baduk is, or notice the fact that one of male lead is inspired by a real Baduk player, or look for what Dooly is. Please keep in mind that this drama has strong cultural background.Hope you enjoy the drama as much as I did (do).", "Reply 1988 walks in the footsteps of Reply 1997, only focuses more on the family dynamics and the old neighbourhood friendships. However, it wasn't as good as the other reply. The main reason that I preferred the 1997 reply over this, was the duration. The 1988's episodes lasted almost two hours each! And they were twenty of them (kudos to the producers; that must have been a challenge). Maybe for some, that wouldn't be a problem, but I personally prefer my dramas short -er, as it's more easy to watch. And the long duration makes it tiring at some point. Anyway, the 1997 reply's main reason for success was the kpop fangirling, that created laughter. Plus, the romance was quite interesting, as it was mixed up with the back and forth of the story. The Reply 1988 had a nice romance, but it was a little predictable and the chemistry between the two of them wasn't that good (I would have preferred the girl to have ended up with another character, as they looked better together). The family stories were quite good, and for me, were better than the friendship-romance. But, in the end, it was a so so drama, with a story that didn't keep the interest till the end, so 3 out of 10, for the good performances.", "From first episode, many cases very unrealistic and no logic comment sense.

Does the director know what is employment agency?This is a very bad drama from the start first episode, why is it best director drama in Paeksang Award?

Although there is a bit of melodrama at few times, the entire cast has done a brilliant job at acting (there is no over-acting by any character). By the end I had warmed up to every character in the drama. The chemistry between the main two characters feels so real. Dong-Wook Lee has been brilliant and its been great seeing an actor of his caliber. It was my first time seeing Ryeowon Jung but she did remind me of Go-eun Kim from Goblin.

Dojeon (Xiumin) practices being a Pierrot clown in his time outside of college, and Hana (Soeun) has a dream to run a food truck. Meeting in the One More club, a club where members take on a new challenge every week, Dojeon and Hana face club drama and potential romance together.Truth be told, I only watched this as I bias Xiumin, and I finally wanted to watch his web drama after watching his movie (Seondal: The Man who Sold the River) and falling in love with his acting. The two roles are very different and far apart from each other, and I wanted to see how well he managed to take that on. Being his first drama, and both his movie and this series being filmed whilst he was a rookie, I have to say, I was blown away. To be a rookie actor and to turn around what he did with Dojeon's character was absolutely wonderful. Dojeon is a character you can really relate to, or I can personally as someone shy and similar to his characteristics. The acting overall in Falling for Dojeon is brilliant. I felt like all the characters were real people, not just people being played by actors, and they all felt like you could just walk outside and bump into them on the street. The storyline was really sweet, and to see how everyone matured and developed over time was lovely to see.The only qualm about this I have is that it definitely could have been much longer. Although it was well paced out for how long it was, there was a lot more that could have been done with this show. For the most watched web drama of 2015, it would have been nice to see a follow-up episode/series after the final episode just to close up a few plot holes and such. However, for what they had with the show, the actors really all did wonderfully, the storyline felt pretty solid, and the ending was sweet enough, with a tiny little cliffhanger (with an obvious enough answer) to keep you guessing a little while after finishing the drama. Although a little cringy at times, Falling for Dojeon really grips the viewer enough to entertain throughout the whole six episodes. A shame there wasn't more to this.I'm definitely going to be watching this much more in the future, and hopefully will be able to get this on DVD.

I hope there will be more drama like it .. six flying dragons is fascinating ..", "Being only halfway thru the series, I almost waited until the end to write a review. This show is just too good to not have any reviews up though, so here's what I've seen thus far.Many Korean dramas are based in the country's history, and this one is also. Not only did the writers pick a particularly tempestuous time period, but also father/son rulers. The story so far has grabbed me from the very fist show, and there's no way I would stop watching through the entire 50+ episodes. The story is written in such a way as to carefully craft each and every character interaction, to best acquaint the audience with all the players. Their stories are being quite intricately developed with many layers. I've found myself sad when some of the worst villains were done away with, because I enjoyed them so much. There are not so many black and white characters, as many shades of gray characters. The writers and extremely talented actors make each character so human, it's easy to forget this story is told in a different century! The entire cast seem to be the best in the field, especially the young men and women. The Lee Bang Won character, played by Yoo An-in, has been absolutely astounding to watch. I've never seen such a young actor bring so much talent to a role. His scenes are some of the most compelling I've ever watched, in any movie or television show. All of the actors are superb in this series.If you've ever been curious about shows from another part of the world, I highly recommend you watch this show. It's a work of art in every way.", "This drama is just soo well written,well acted that it will make you go on a roller coaster of feelings, 50 episodes may appear as if it's a lot,i swear that it is faar from being enough", "I said I would never watch a drama with more than 25 episodes (because once I get addicted to it, I can't stop myself). However, I am glad I broke my rule for this show... I started watching it because of Yoo Ah in. After watching his other drama, Secret Affair, and fell in love with his acting, I searched for his other works. He didn't disappoint me at all in Six Flying Dragon! I actually got to appreciate his acting more in this series than his movie, Throne, due to the epic scale of this series. He was able to showcase the fine change from a young, reckless, enthusiastic man to a man who would take any measures to fulfill his ambition and to survive...even though these measure hurt himself deeply in many ways at the same time. I was particularly astounded by the scene where his father put the blade right next to his throat. Yoo Ah-In amazingly showed many complicated feelings at once, desire for power, fear, determination, relief, and sorrow. He has had other scenes in which he acted as a son arguing with the father. However, this scene was by far the best.. It was like listening to an orchestra with so many instruments in harmony that you just want to stand up and say BRAVO!! Yoo Ah-In is just such a talented and ...insane actor. I wish he becomes an international actor soon. He won the best actor award over Soong Joong Ki from Descendant of the Sun. I have watched both shows and like both of them. However, I think Yoo Ah-In's winning is well deserved. BACK TO THE STORY.... it hurts and is painful when you watch it. It is quite realistic in the sense that it is hard to root for many characters. A friend today may become an enemy tomorrow. An underdog may become a villain. People kill each other not because they hate each other. It makes you wonder if killing is really necessary? Is it really justice? what is it all about? just like a line that got repeated several times: don't blame yourself, it is the world that's too unreasonable. Even though it had many episodes, the pace of the series was actually quite fast so audience never got bored. The series is multi-dimensional. Each dragon had rich stories behind him and her. It is kind of like Game of Thrones. However has a deeper depiction of human nature than GOT. I typically am not a big fan of action scenes and sometimes just fast forward it (which I did for GOT sometimes.) However, the fighting scenes were so beautifully staged that I watched through all of them. It is hard to neglect the music in those scenes too. I also like the role of Moo-hyul. When everything got so dark and heavy, he appearance really allowed audience to take a chirpy breath. Actor Kyun- Sang Yoon mastered this role nicely! The only weak side, in my opinion, is the love scenes between Bang-Won and Boon-Yi. Their interaction did not seem to move me as much the couple interaction in the Secret Affair. I can't feel much passion and desire in Boon-Yi. OVERALL, it was a very successful series! The number of episodes may stop some audience from watching it. However, trust me! it would be a great journey when you watch it!", "The story is mainly about the founding of the Joseon dynasty with a smattering of star crossed lovers. It lasts for 50 episodes and most of them deal with the court intrigue and power struggles over many years but manage to hold your interest by their clever twists and turns. I would have given it nine but for some odd reason when a character first appears on screen and often subsequently they tell you their future status. If you know for example someone is going to be the king of Joseon then you know whatever predicament they face they will survive, at least until they become the king of Joseon. I did not like any of the main characters at the end because they all had serious shortcomings which is not a bad thing as it made them more human. The only character I liked and felt sorry for was Cheok Sa Gwang a deadly assassin, which sounds odd but hopefully you will understand when you watch this excellent series.", "This was exceptional beyond words.

One of the big advantages of these shows is the fact that they are series that usually run for just one season. As so many shows these days get cancelled on cliffhangers, you don't run any risk of that happening with a K-drama.The series i am about to review, D-Day, is one of those shows you just have to binge watch. Yes, it really is that good. In D-Day the capital city of Seoul gets hit by a violent earthquake. It then focuses on the brave men and women of the rescue-services and a hospital that are left behind to deal with the effects of the aftermath.Let's first talk about the special effects on this show. Usually effects on TV shows are mediocre at best, simply because of budget restraints. However that was definitely not noticeable on D-day, because when the earthquake strikes, it can stand up to the effects used in big Hollywood blockbuster movies. Even more striking are the effects that are used more subtly throughout the show, like small cracks on roads and buildings. All these help to make you believe that there really has been an earthquake that destroyed most of Seoul.However it is not the effects that makes this show so great. No that right is reserved for the wonderful cast of characters and the actors that portray them. Every single character, from the main characters to the lowest sub characters, has it's role to play in the unfolding drama. The lead character is doctor Lee Hae-Sung, a doctor who is known to be reckless in his pursuit of saving human lives. The natural charisma of him (a credit to actor Young- wang Kim) makes you rooting for everything he does all throughout the show. He is soon joined in the series by the young female doctor Jung Ddol-mi, another character you will fall in love with as the series progresses. She provides most of the comic relief, a thing that is well needed in what would otherwise be a pretty bleak and depressing show. The list of characters is very big and to name them all is just not something i am going to be doing here. However my review would not be complete to not at least mention the hospital director Park Gun. I don't think i have ever seen a person that i hated more in a TV series than this loathsome man. Trust me when i say that you will come to hate him as well. But oh wow, is he played well by actor Kyeong-yeong Lee.The series will take you on a roller-coaster trip throughout a total of 20 episodes. It will make you laugh, cry and sit on the edge of your seat, and once you start it will be hard to stop watching it. Is the show perfect? No of course not. Yes there are some moments in the show that feel forced, or in which there are some overacted scenes of emotions. I also read some reviews that did not like the ending of the series. That of course is, as it is with most things, a matter of opinion. I for one loved the ending, which i am not going to be spoiling here.Overall though i loved this show and give it a 9 out of 10 score.", "This is my second kdrama, like Mr Sunshine, that i feel the drama is like a movie. Must be hugely invested, the scene of earthquake, the destroy of the city, are all so real.Male lead, the reckless doctor, is a bit too tall for the female lead.

It does not earn attention that it should have got."], "450": ["Let me start out with the positives, because there are some. I liked the chemistry between the actors, and it's very easy to tell that they got along on set. I also enjoyed the comedy of this, I found myself laughing a lot during it.The problem is mainly with one aspect of the show, and unfortunately it's a big one. The writing for this is awful. The choices that the characters are not only nonsensical, they're choices that no human would ever make. The main story doesn't flow, and there's a huge plot shift part way throughout the show. There's also this mystery which I already knew the answer to the first time it's brought up. Another thing which got over very irritating was the music, whenever the characters were silent they would play this music which would describe how they feel. Seriously, we know what's going on, we don't need this music.I'll talk about the four main characters. The main lead's is one of those clumsy characters you either love or hate, I personally found her irritating, this type of character was done much better in other shows such as Ugly Betty. The male lead...okay I guess, though the actor wasn't as good as his costars. The second female lead had the best subplot, and she has several interesting dilemmas. But the spotlight was stolen by Choi Siwon's character, Shin-Hyuk, mainly because the man was hilarious and the character knew how ridiculous everything going on was. Seriously, Shin-Hyuk needs his own spin off, that's how funny he was!Overall, this drama does have some good moments, but if you're going to watch it throw logic out of the window.", "Much, much better than a fairy-tale. If the childhood with its tales passed, behold there are movies like this, that can say a delightful story with pleasant, trustworthy people.A series truly like a tale, very, very originally, about a childhood love fulfilled after fifteen years, after a special series of events, rarely sad, the most are very funny. In addition, much common sense in this series story. I really like that is no knavery, grudge, selfishness. I'm fine with sincere and friendly solutions, I love happy endings. There are many beautiful, delightful, intelligent, funny scenes. I could see some scenes often, never bored. All the story is well thought out and developed; like a puzzle (some in movie's plot) in which the parts hang together. The main character Hye-Jin(actress Hwang Jung-Eum) is acting perfectly, no secondary character to surpass. I found that is good so. If I have to nitpick something it would be this: I'd have liked character Sung-Joon (actor Park Seo-Joon) to be oldster in the final scene with his daughter; The series could very well be called ,,The Umbrella''.A series that can bee seen even for the many funny scenes.", "She was pretty, as the very name suggests, is about a girl who used to be very pretty and rich.

On the other hand, her ugly child friend, who happened to be her first love and had moved away years ago, which resulted to them loosing any contact, comes back as a handsome, successful man. Needless to say the drama is full of awkward situations and clumsy romance. The first episodes are very entertaining and the romance seems promising. But the love triangle, for me, ruined the drama. Plus, the protagonist kind of changed when she became \"pretty\" again. She was more independent and loud and tomboy when she was \"ugly, and then she changed her clothes and became all girly and cute and fragile. And there were things that remained unexplained, like the the male leads tend to not hear anyone when he was reading from his computer. Anyway, it was an okay drama so 6 out of 10.", "Where is the charisma, charm and comedy brilliance of Classic Hollywood? All those souls realizing Hollywood has descended to the least common denominator have taken rebirth in Korea.Joen-eum Hwang is as charming and attractive as Cary Grant, her over-the top comedy expressions are as funny as Gene Wilder or Madeline Kahn, her expressions of love and caring are as sincere as Audrey Hepburn. She plays a unique combination- a sexy and charming model type who is also a funny looking hilarious clown. I didn't expect there could be another talent of the calibre of Ji-Hyun Jun, but I was wrong.She is supposed to be playing an ugly character, nominally indicated with outrageously fake clown freckles painted on her cheeks, but she is drop-dead gorgeous and terminally cute. The other players also do great, especially the many supporting characters that are spot-on and totally convincing. Jun-hee Ko, her close friend, was brilliant with a difficult dramatic role. Other reviewers have favored Si Won Choi, who played a kind of crazy,lovable joker, always playing practical jokes. His character was as exaggerated as Hwang's, and provided a counter-balance to her eccentricity. I didn't think his few moments of sincere feeling were as \"real\" as the other main actors. The other main character is her love interest played by Seo-joon Park, who is credible but it's tough to make an impression while Hwang is busy chewing up all the scenery.The premise is along the lines of \"Ugly Betty\", but the plot lines as far as I can tell are totally different.Other reviewers have criticized the plot as having unbelievable coincidences and character decisions. Classic comedy from Plautus, through Shakespeare and Billy Wilder, uses plots based on unlikely coincidence, mistaken identity and complicated love triangles frustrated by people's deceptions. That's how the genre works to portray human behavior in a condensed, engaging format. The character's choices were mostly believable enough, for me, given their many insecurities and hang-ups. If people didn't often helplessly do stupid things there could not be any movies at all.What I liked about the story line was that many complex story lines were dovetailed together supporting each other, all supporting the arcs of the main characters. I also liked how how the characters and situations evolved into a continuing story. The series contains its own sequels. It doesn't follow the Hollywood formula of a single big climax.You wont see much skin or sex beyond holding hands and kissing. The characters follow a strict and hard to believe pre-marital moral code. They also have a strong work ethic; one main message of the series is that everyone should work very hard at their corporate job to attain success through team effort, which will bring happiness. It's the opposite of subversive. The outcomes for everyone are very predictable from the beginning, which is how it should be in a screwball comedy. The fun is getting there.", "Jeong-eum Hwang is a gifted comedian as well as actor. Her physical comedy is of the same type as Jerry Lewis, but it works better for me. Where Jerry Lewis' neurotic character makes me cringe with discomfort for his pain rather than laugh, Hwang's neurotic character while panic-stricken and shaking with fear nevertheless comes across as being strong in spite of that. Her physical comedy and her mugging is inspired... funnier to me than Lucille Ball, in the same class as Madeline Kahn or Claudette Colbert.Beyond that, though, she is able to mix up completely straight acting, heart-warming and genuine, with outrageous clowning and make it work. She is supposed to be ugly, but it's a comedy, and the fact that she really looks like a model made up like a clown, or Little Orphan Annie, is part of the fun. She is actually gorgeous with very fake painted freckles and a frizzy hairdo to provide a pretense of ugliness.Korean cinema is producing actors like Hwang and Ji-hyun Jun who rival Hollywood's classic best in charisma and talent. All the actors did a great job. Si Won Choi carried off his own intensely over-the-top comic role.Someone said the story was illogical. Classic comedy from ancient Roman times to Shakespeare and right up to the great screwball comedies of the 30's and 40's is all based on an engine of preposterous coincidence, mistaken identity, and entangled love triangles. It's wildly improbably but the conventions of the genre allow it to highlight aspects of human behavior that are dead accurate, compressing lifetimes of intensity into a few hours. The exaggeration and compression is what turns observations of human behavior into entertainment.In fact compared to the comedic plots of Plautus, Shakespeare or Frank Capra, I found \"She Was Pretty\" to be much more believable as well as more complex and intricate. Several people thought the plot was unlikely, that characters would not make those choices. I found them very plausible. People in intense emotional relationships, and even in distant work relationships, don't make rational choices. They don't make good choices. At least from what I have seen, people do dumb and self-sabotaging things more often than not. The reasons the characters give for their actions might in some cases seem a stretch, unless you consider the strong emotions of fear and shame that drive them. The soundtrack was also criticized. I enjoyed it. Lyrics are sung loudly right over dialog, where the lyrics are classic songs expressing the emotions the characters are going through even as they are barely able to acknowledge it themselves. I thought that was unusual and creative and that it helped to communicate the great timeless feelings people have about romance. One of the themes of the film is panic, panic attacks, both from trauma and from love-obsession. The examination of psychological stress and the support of friendship gives the series a weight beyond just making us laugh, although it did that for me very well.One of things Korean TV is not is subversive. Don't expect insightful social criticism or political commentary. The story basically exalts conventional Korean social values, as well as the worship of fashion and conspicuous consumption, in spite of some egalitarian themes. These writers would not have had to worry about being put on the Hollywood blacklist (1947-1960). Nor is it Monty Python or Douglas Adams, comedy that is often built on brilliant philosophical questioning. The Korean Wave is strictly pop culture as far as I have seen... I gather a sort of Confucian social conservatism and conformity is a Korean national value. Have only watched about 2/3 of it so far although as such comedies go the outcome is 200% predictable after a few episodes; I don't expect to be surprised. I don't want to be. The fun is how you get there.", "From my title review people might think that I am a big fan of Choi Siwon but believe me that I am not a fan nor knowing him a lot as an actor I only recognize him as a member from super junior boy group from south Korea. I seldom watch Siwon's drama mainly because his choice of drama plot sometimes was not interesting. This drama has interesting beginning but weak plot near the ending until the end and acting of the main actors are just so so. It's easy to guess how the story goes on and the acting of the hero is totally sucks.Hwang Jeung Eum the heroine acting decent however she still needs a compatible partner to balance her acting but the weak plot and the predictable scenes gave no surprise and the hero just ruined the show by showing his incapability as an actor with his stiff act and weak face expression. Lame scenes of usual Korean drama and weak characters keep showing not giving me enough interest to hang on for this drama. Only Siwon who was acting good throughout the show with his good act and funny facial expressions, not to mention his understanding toward his character which made his character became lovable and there was one actor Park Yoohwan his acting and his facial expression are better compare to the main actor. Predictable plot and ending are such a reason why this drama is boring.The soundtrack mostly annoyed me with the horrid singing by the singers that the production company chose, not enough feeling to sway me with this drama's idea, background song/ost. is truly important for the audiences to make \"it feel\" from the drama. Once again Choi Siwon with his acoustic singing and music turned out as a decent background music of his character.", "This show was soooooo long. Should have been wrapped up in about 10 episodes. The lead male character was the most annoying, insensitive, selfish character - not to mention STUPID. Fancy being teased your whole life and growing up to treat others like you were. The first half of this show he treated the female lead like a total trashbag. If he had half a brain in his head it would not have taken him nearly as long to figure out that she was the one he was looking for. Nevertheless, I get it - it's TV. But I prefer a show that I can keep a level of belief. As annoying as the character \"Ten\" was - at least he liked her regardless of status, which is something you could feel he wanted reciprocated.", "After watching kmhm, the male lead is in my mind brother of hwang, female lead.

I would watch again \"Tunnel\", and especially \"Signal\", in a heartbeat, but \"Cheo Yong\" will not be on my list of watch-again series."], "460": [], "461": [], "462": ["The Virtual Bride (aka The Eccentric Daughter-in-Law) is a 12 episode KTV drama from the summer of 2015.SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: A struggling young idol agrees to star in a variety show in order to gain popularity for her and the girl idol group she's a member of. This \"fake\" variety show involves her going to live and work with the mother of the guy she's \"pretend\" dating, along with said guy, and their extended family.This shows stars Kim Dasom (I don't know what her actress name or real life name is, but she's a member of the idol group \"Sistar\"). I am familiar with Sistar and who Dasom is, but this my first exposure to her as an actress. She has participated in two other TV dramas prior to this, but they were both well over 100 episodes, and I have neither the time nor inclination to watch shows of that length. The first thing you should know about Dasom is that she is SMOKING hot (just like all of her Sistar idol mates). The entire group is built (ahem) to be as sexy as possible, while still trying to exhibit a cute and fun appeal at the same time; go watch some of their music videos and you'll see what I'm referring to. Can Dasom act though?, and, is this show worthwhile?...well, let's find out!As our story begins, Dasom's character (Oh In Young) makes her way to the variety show set (which takes place in a farm/home setting which prepares various traditional Korean food & sauces for restaurants & other buyers). This is a place that requires you to work hard and get your hands dirty. In Young, however, loves her high heels and skimpy flashy outfits and she's ill-suited for this environment at first. As such, the family she's moved in with disapproves of her right away, but they've agreed to do the show, and if it's well received, their business will prosper (and so will In Young and her idol group & company). Over time, the show becomes popular as In Young fits in a little better, and starts slowly winning over the entire family and their ever discerning family matriarch. And of course, she and her nerdy but handsome \"fake show love interest costar\" begin to have actual feelings for each other.You'll immediately notice this show has a pretty low budget. That's OK, but you must compensate for fiscal restraints by having some combination of a good story, solid writing, proper direction, and stellar acting performances. Unfortunately, this show doesn't really do any one of those things very well. You know you're in for some pain and suffering when the first couple of episodes consist mainly of a midriff baring lead having multiple gassy/fart problems, followed by the introduction of several stereotypical self-centered & annoying Korean cinema mothers, followed by a bunch of mama boys that need to grow up, followed by younger female characters who are searching for self-empowerment. YUK!The second thing you'll notice about this show is that it resembles a long running day time Korean soap opera that's been compressed to 12 episodes and played on fast forward. Almost every scene consists of a one or two minute interaction between one or more cast members, then it's on to the next one or two minute scene. The way it's scripted and framed doesn't help matters either; it consists mainly of a close up shot of Character A reading a single line, then a close up of Character B reading a single line, then repeat some back and forth like this until the end of their short scene. At the end of each scene, someone references or mentions something about a 3rd party not involved in the current scene. Then, cut away to said 3rd party having their own short scene, then continue this formula FOREVER until the show eventually concludes.Because of how the scenes are written, there never seems to be any personal interaction or meaningful communication among any of the character. It feels like everyone is just reading lines and nothing more. All of the characters involved are supposed to \"evolve\" over time, but it's a very cumbersome & repetitive process along the way; someone accepts someone, then turns their back on them, then accepts them again; this pattern of behavior is repeated often throughout this show between multiple characters, and, it really becomes tedious and just plain absurd as the show drags on. As a result, this show is severely lacking in any depth, and it fails to ever build any suspense, tension, or momentum.The cast does what they're asked, and they mostly do OK (but just barely). There are several insufferable performances though, and no standout ones. The cast's star power and /or acting prowess (or lack thereof) isn't the problem here though; where this show fails clearly lies at the feet of the writers and the director. Good K-dramas build towards their climax and include multiple important scenes where you can't take your eyes off the screen, which in turn, engages the viewer to invest in the story, care about its characters, and look forward to the next episode. Sadly, this show doesn't ever accomplish any of this. As far as Dasom's performance goes, she did all right with what she was given to work with. I doubt she'll ever win any best actress awards, but she could likely make a decent living in this field if given the chance to be aligned with shows that have better stories and some decent writing and direction. Until that happens though, she shouldn't quit her day job with Sistar (which she is excellent at)!Summary: Unfortunately, I have to drop the hammer on this show; it's neither interesting nor intelligent nor original. This is clearly a project that was just designed to quickly fill a time slot and nothing more. In short, it has no heart and no soul. Don't waste your time with this.Bottom Line: 4 out of 10 stars!...Not recommended!"], "463": [], "464": [], "465": ["Joo Won is the doctor hero here. He saves Kim Taehee the princess in this drama from her medically induced coma. The villain is Jo Hyun Jae the evil greedy corporate brother and they are also in a medical setting with decent supporting cast. It's fast, fun and fearless. The only thing that bothered me was how the story starts to sink when the evil brother dies. The show should have ended with the death of the evil brother. Instead you get couple of episodes at the end which fills like a filler. Of course Joo Won has been in a medical drama before \"Good Doctor\" where he shone as the doctor with autism. He is brilliant here-very brilliant, he is part doctor/stuntman/hustler and what not. Joo Won is very good here. Kim Taehee is competent in her role but not brilliant here. The only surprising thing about this show is the career turning move and the breakout performance of Jo Hyun Jae who plays the evil brother. This is really the first time he has played a villain of course he played a smirky sneaky adman in \"Ad Genius Lee Tae Baek\", but this is a full on villain role. Jo Hyun Jae is that actor that has always played the sweet baby faced hero prince in countless Korean dramas. Here, he is menacing, intelligent, cold, heartless, articulate and passionate. Who knew he had that inside of him? The scene of the dinner party is a standout scene for Jo Hyun Jae. This is a revelation-not to be taken lightly. Move over Jo In sung and Jung Woo Sung, here comes Jo Hyun Jae!", "Yong pal is a really good drama mainly because of the actors well except for Joo Won as the main lead and because of the realistic plot of the heiress's leadership and gaining ultimate power from her evil surroundings including her own brother. This drama is more focusing on Han Yoe Jin's survival with Yong pal/Kim Tae Hyun's help throughout eps while the title yong pal means gang doctor doesn't really right for the whole story, also inserting their love story. I really enjoy this drama because of Kim Tae Hee's incredible acting. I'm not really a big fan of her, her dramas which I watched are \"stairway to heaven, love story in harvard, iris, jang OK jung\" not really appealing for me and her acting felt so so but in \"My princess and yong pal\" she really did a good job. Here she was acting great portraying a hurtful, loving, and cruel person at the same time and when she did cruel things instead of hating her I felt sympathy to her since we the audiences could understand her reasons and her pains for doing so. Not just a pretty face but this woman really can act. It's hard to gain audiences' sympathy nowadays since audiences' become smarter each time.However Joo Woon really disappointing while I was his fan at first but now I have to change that. Watching him first time since \"Baker king\" followed by \"Good doctor and Nodame cantabile\" (Korean version) feel that yong pal is his most degrading acting. He really didn't have many expressions either receiving bad and sad news, even felt disappointed he showed nothing very lack of affection towards his wive while he claimed he loves his wive so much nearing the end of the eps.This drama should have ended at 16 but the producer decided to extend it to 18 eps since they wanted the main couple to have a happy ending which I find unnecessarily. The story is perfect ending at 16 where Han yoe jin and kim tae hyun saying good bye to each other due to the difference thought of life, she is a leader of multi national companies in her hand lies thousands of people life depending on her good and cruel leadership while he is a naive doctor who is not thinking bright of humans' mind and rather stupid of business's world helping her evil brother just like betraying his own wive but he did not realize that. Both characters are too different to each other to live together unless she can let go of her company or he let go of his naive thoughts and what he called a kindness if not he'll be continued being used as a tool to hurt her. The writer of this drama at first making yong pal's character really good and bright he understood how the society works but nearing the end the writer wanted to make a conflict between a lover hence creating the naivety of yong pal who was being raised as a poor child and had already felt the cool and the cruel reality of the world which rather not make sense, I blame the writer and the producer who was trying to change the original concept of this drama to their own mellow dramatized version.Yes it's a happy and short ending.", "There are lots of good kdramas, but only perhaps a dozen or so which really stand out as better than the rest. While this one doesn't get that much credit in many lists of top kdramas, I think it is in that top dozen.

I mentioned previously that I am not disappointed because this movie still gives out a great story line despite the cliches. If the first one gives u heavy water works, then this sequel gives u deeper understanding on forgiveness and human sins. \nThe visual is great ; and the acting here is amazing which blends with the great story line.Conclusion: This movie is great if you get pass all the typical Asian cliche drama because it got great story line, promising premise which can set a great universe , good settings and great acting.

Yes, it already had all the makings of a blockbuster, but it surpassed even projections by pundits. Surpassing 10 million viewers in only 15 days, Along with the Gods: The Two Worlds tripled returns of the US$36 million investment on the 2-parter, and became the second highest-grossing film of all time in Korea.Most importantly, it will be remembered as \"that emotional rollercoaster of a film that kept my waterworks going\".Given my history with the franchise, I prepared an extra packet of tissues for the viewing of the sequel. But sadly, I hardly used a piece. Although both titles were shot together, Along with the Gods: The Last 49 Days feels like a distant product. It pushed up the sliders on scale and size, but lost the epic in their storytelling and pacing.What happened, Director Kim Yong-hwa?The film returns us to hell, and along with the three guardians Gang-lim (Ha Jung-woo), Haewonmak (Ju Ji-hoon) and Lee Deok-choon (Kim Hyang-gi), we now accompany new paragon Kim Soo-hong (Kim Dong-wook) - brother of first episode's paragon, Kim Ja-hong - through his trials.While the first chapter had Ja-hong as the plot anchor, The Last 49 Days turns our attention to the 3 guardians and their mysterious past. This, to me, is where the sequel flounders.It's not long before we splinter into various story arcs. There's the main story of the trio's pasts, retold through increasingly frustrating flashbacks that sometimes last no more than a minute. Then there's the added task from King Yeomra, which dispatches Haewonmak and Deok-choon to claim a long-overdue soul, Hur Choon-sam (Nam Il-woo).Turns out the old fellow (who appears briefly in the first film) is protected by his ultra-powerful resident Household God Seongju (Ma Deok-seok). As the two guardians struggle to wrestle the deity into submission, they find out not only his reason for protecting his client, but also that he was an ex-guardian who was there at their own passing - thus a key to retrieving their memories.Add to that, Gang-lim's supposed agenda is throwing in all his chips to get Soo-hong reincarnated, Soo-hong's own unwillingness to do so because he doesn't want to believe that his friends murdered him, Seongju's bout with failed investments and helping his actual charge (Choon-sam's grandson) to find a real guardian, and you have essentially a very diluted film. Even King Yeomra is not spared with his own little twist!By sowing 49 Days with so much storyline, a deft director might still be able to measure out portions of steer his priorities in the right direction to maintain a strong plot with a moral compass like the first. But Kim dropped the hat on this one. The second episode flickers back and forth stories incoherently, and makes for a frustrating viewing.Most annoying of all is Soo-hong's temperamental behaviour. It seems to serve only as a catalyst to drive Gang-lim's actions, and loses potency because of it. Gang-lim's own guilt-laden agenda is also slightly unbearable, given how it was obvious halfway what it was really all about.While the film does still feature gorgeous graphics and settings, it has lost a slight shine from the first film's reveal. We get to see a new scene for Indolence Hell, but other new segments really raise eyebrows in the wrong way. One word - dinosaurs.Along with the Gods: The Last 49 Days stays on track in terms of a continuation, but the calibre is far more hollow than the first. You'll get to enjoy some light sobbing at the end, but this second chapter leaves no lasting impression.Let's hope the next episode fares better.

Yet the drama, wit & humor are truly delightful.", "If the first movie epitomises redemption, then the sequel dives headlong into forgiveness. Along With the Gods: The Two Worlds was a helluva ride through the underworld; the only misstep for me is how it went overboard with the ludicrous special effects. By that I mean how the vengeful spirit and Gang Rim go mano a mano with the city as their playground. The sequel, Along With the Gods: The Last 49 Days, was shot together with the massively popular first film and it has become the second all-time box-office grosser in South Korea. However, it is an overstuffed shadow of the first film.The sequel begins moments after the end of The Two Worlds, with the three guardians, Gang Rim (Ha Jung-woo), Haewonmak (Ju Ji-hoon) and Lee Dukchun (Kim Hyang-gi) guiding their 49th soul Kim Soo-hong (Kim Dong-wook), the brother of Kim Ja-hong, to the trials for his reincarnation. The stakes are higher because if it is successful, the three guardians will also be reincarnated. King Yeomra (Lee Jung-jae), Lord of the Afterlife, agrees to a fair trail on the condition that Gang Rim proceeds with the case on his own, while Haewonmak and Dukchun go down to the world of humans to dispatch a troublesome housegod Sung-joo (Ma Dong-seok) and ascend an overdue soul.The Last 49 Days has a lot to live up to and it just could not sustain under the weight of expectations set by its predecessor. The first half becomes a bit of a slog with the pacing largely going missing and the world-building taking a backseat. This is a case of lightning not being able to strike the same spot twice.Firstly, the chemistry between the three guardians of the Afterlife went missing in the first two acts, partly because Gang Rim and his compatriots are separated. Like The Two Worlds, the narrative becomes two-pronged but sadly neither reaches the same dizzying levels. Soo-hong makes for an annoying and smart-alecky character, who doesn't garner the same sympathy as his brother, Ja-hong. It is a good move that the story doesn't go through the same process as Ja-hong but what takes its place doesn't make for compelling viewing, and dinosaurs don't help. Haewonmak and Dukchun fare better because of the intriguing character of Sung-joo, a superb casting choice. However, this time round the Stephen-Chow-resque slapstick comedy is a hit or miss.Secondly, director Kim Yong-hwa couldn't quite find the right balance between the light fantastic and the hard-hitting drama, which led to pacing issues, so much so that I did the dreaded thing - I checked my watch.However, all is not lost... when the story does hit the final act with the story of the three guardians revealed, it hits its groove.

The story about the boy and the background story on the three main characters were interesting and kind of sad. The trial part, however, failed to impress. And when all the stories came together, it was a quick and awkward mass up, concluding everything so we could move on to the next chapter about the othe soldier, whose story will be presented in the third movie. I just hope that the last one will be the best one.\nOther than that, the performances were really well by all the actors in the film and they actually looked natural.

And I stopped 1/3 of the way through.", "If you like first part\nDon't watch it!!!\nDont spend your time with this movie", "What a beautiful, powerful movie!\nAside from being very entertaining, it delivers a strong, humane message about pain, forgiveness, hope, love, and caring for people; to quote some of the best quotes of the movie:\n\"There are no bad people, only bad circumstances\"\n\"Everyone you meet will go away some day\". - Reminds us of our own mortality, and to be kind to one another, for our time on this earth is finite. At least my two cents on the matter.\nA beautiful movie. I loved it. I recommend it.", "Along with the Gods: The Last 49 Days is the sequel to Along with the Gods: The Two Worlds and a vast improvement over the first part that suffered from a chaotic story line, exaggerated special effects and shallow characters. This sequel gives the characters involved more depth by telling their moving background stories that are all cleverly interwoven. The plot is more structured despite numerous flashbacks and side stories and leaves no questions unanswered at the end. The special effects are still present but used with precision, intellect and care this time around.There are only a few minor elements to criticize. The movie is slightly overlong with a length of one hundred forty-two minutes. The film could have been shortened by at least fifteen minutes or so in the middle section. Another problem is that the film tries to be a tearjerker and while several scenes are genuinely moving, the last third of the film feels overtly melancholic. It's so intense towards the end that it almost becomes a parody.Still, the character development, detailed plot and better use of special effects make this blockbuster a vast improvement over the first part. If you haven't watched the first movie however, you won't fully understand what's going on in this one. If one puts the two movies together as a complete piece of art, it's a decent to very good blockbuster comparable to contemporary Hollywood cinema with its breathtaking effects but at times shallow stories.", "First off, I loved the first part to the core. It was action-packed, emotional and magical.This happens with LAST 49 DAYS also. It has a lot of action, drama, some comedy and twists presented in a screenplay that is thoroughly engaging and will keep you hooked to the end despite of long duration.The guardians are all excellent as before, but this time their characters have been explored so well that no glitches matter after a point of time. Ha Jung-woo excels in the film with his strong expressions and dialogue delivery. Surprisingly enough, Ju Ji-hoon takes the cake for an astonishing performance, while Kim Hyang-gi still delivers a cute performance. Ma Dong-seok is a worthy addition to the cast and you'll love his character. Lee Jung-jae is brilliant as he was in the first one. Kim Dong-wook is superb.The action sequences are once again breathtaking but this time the director has kept them more grounded. From chases to superhero-esque fights to sword fights etc: every action block clicks. The director has used action sequences in a very interesting way, making them an integral part of the story while not losing grip on the characters or story. Visual effects are still dazzling but the focus seems more on story than CGI so it's a little less glossy than the prequel.The emotional depth of the characters makes them extremely likable. Perhaps this is another thing which makes this fantasy action sequel a bit better than the THE TWO WORLDS, even though the prequel has an upper hand in terms of pacing, action choreography and visual spectacle.", "The balanced and imaginative baritina of Adam goes with his own life and his personal experiences in relation to what is valuable and anti-value, and at that time the viewer judges himself unconscious. it was very beautiful"], "468": [], "469": ["Overall, it is a decent show with a good cast. There are however some annoyances I have had while watching this show.Plot:\nThe show felt directionless, with no clear plan or goal. Characters were bouncing from one idea to the next to defeat Gwi almost every episode which some might argue was intentional but it certainly left me feeling as if the script was written on the day of shooting.<//Spoiler> The show suffered several plot holes, the largest of which occured near the end of the series, with the Sung Yoel, the Scholar, deciding not to kill Gwi with seemingly no reason other than to drag the show to 20 episodes long. This could reflect a lack of planning of events in the writing process. <Spoiler//>The lack of story progression is also an issue especially poignant in the first 6 episodes, whereby the trope of Sung Yoel saving Yang Sun and giving her blood is repeated 2 times or more. Rather than a build up to the climax, the story spends its first few episodes following Sung Yoel to and fro his residence saving Yang Sun from danger at the very last moment time and time again.Although quite uninteresting, it is not lost on me that the introductory episodes helped to establish a level of intimacy and romance between Yang Sun and Sung Yoel, which compels the viewer to sympathise with Sung Yoel's background and identity and his \"sacrifice\". The role reversal between Yang Sun and Sung Yoel in the later episodes (whereby it is Yang Sun who constantly finds herself bringing the injured Sung Yoel back to his residence and even offering him her blood) is somewhat touching and commendable from a literary standpoint. Furthermore, by drawing a parallel between Sung Yoel's dead lover and his current one, the film highlights the conflict between man and beast internally and this too is also compelling.Finally, aside from the relationship of the main protagonist, no other felt moving or even genuine. Case in point, the relationship between the Queen and the Crown Prince was set up as an arranged marriage and the Queen was given no prior characterisation aside from her hatred towards her Father. Yet, the script attempts to convince the audience that their relationship was something more. There was a sense that the script tried to do too much with too little (time) which left me feeling that most other romances in the script were very paper-thin. (5/10)Scoring/Background music: The scoring was good, which to me meant it served its purpose in conveying the characters' emotions, but not really something I would put in a playlist and listen to on a regular basis. Music was played at fitting and appropriate times with lyrics matching events happening. Fade-outs of the music could have been timed with the start of a new scene to make it more appealing. (7/10)Lines and line delivery: Acting was great. However, actors seemed to be constrained by a weak script. A decent chunk of the script seemed to be information relay, which is not really needed and can take place off screen, giving more screen time to character development. Exposition could have been replaced with actual scenes non-verbally providing information to the audience. Rather the script chooses to \"tell, not show\".Another pet peeve I had with the script was the fact that the characters often stated the obvious, as if intentionally dumbing down the dialogue because the writer could not trust the audience enough to be a little more discrete. Also infuriating was the number of times a character asks \"Is that true?\" immediately after being told of a fact or right after a major revelation.A sort of meta-reflective dialogue towards the last part of the show whereby Yang Sun uses the Night Scholar novels to refer to the show as a whole is refreshing. (5/10)Special effects and choreography: Fight choreography did not fall into the common one-at-a-time pitfall which plague many good movies, whereby the hero or protagonist, badly outnumbered, is able to take on a group of enemies because they approach him one at a time. Special effects were modern and realistic, keeping the audience immersed in the fictional world. (8/10)", "The story is gripping from the get go, with just enough mystery to keep me watching until the end.The immortal vampire Gwi had been summoned to help build a new kingdom after the fall of the Goryeo dynasty, but the price to pay in exchange for his help becomes too great for the succeeding monarchs to tolerate. Possibly the strongest vampire in all the land, the quest to get rid of him is tough and seemingly impossible. It spans generations.Kim Sung Yeol was a loyal friend of Crown Prince Junghyun when he got bitten and turned into a vampire. His friend and family murdered for treason, he vowed to live on with the sole intent of destroying Gwi once and for all.More than a century later, he meets a young girl dressed as a man working hard to support her impoverished family by selling books. He commissions her help in locating something and they develop a good friendship, which eventually leads to romance.The chemistry between the two leads started out great, but turned stale towards the end as far as the lead actress went. Luckily, her leading man was Lee Joon Gi, and his skills as an actor were more than enough to carry out the brunt and intensity of their relationship.The soundtrack is good too, though sometimes felt out of place. The fight sequences could have been better.8/10"], "470": [], "471": [], "472": ["Oh My Ghost (aka Oh My Ghostess) is a 16 episode 2015 KTV drama. The story involves a lowly kitchen worker who wants to become a chef, the head chef as the romantic interest, and a ghost who wants to settle her grudge. There's also a murder mystery angle involved.SPOILERS AHEAD!Our story revolves around 2 young women; one is a lonely restaurant assistant who has a crush on her boss, but is too shy to act on it. She also happens to have the ability to see ghosts, which ain't helping her any in her personal or professional life. The other woman is a ghost who can't find her way to the afterlife because she's resentful that she died a virgin. She can't remember how she died and doesn't really care at first., she's just looking to inhabit any living woman she can in order to lose her virginity so she can finally leave this world. Ghost girl meets living girl and discovers that the chef she has a crush on is one of the few living men who can handle her \"supernatural sexual powers\". Thus, ghost girl plans to quickly enter living girl's body to have sex with this chef in order to satisfy her desires before departing earth forever.What happens here is ghost girl periodically inhabits living girl in order to accomplish her main goal (i.e. getting laid). This creates all kinds of problems for the living girl, as she can't remember anything that occurs when the ghost girl takes over her body. Furthermore, these two women are polar opposites in terms of their personalities; living girl is timid and lethargic, and ghost girl is an aggressive loud mouth. Thus, everyone around living girl now thinks she's suffering from some multiple personality disorder as she switches back & forth from quiet & reserved to boisterous & outgoing (depending on whether her body is being occupied by the ghost girl or not).Unfortunately for ghost girl, this chef she's trying to seduce has old fashioned values and wants to take the slow approach to a relationship. She just wants to hop in the sack with the guy, but he won't acquiesce, and this frustrates her to no end. Left with few options, ghost girl and living girl team up in order to find a solution for each of their separate problems; ghost girl helps living girl blossom as an all-around woman and win over the man she likes, and living girl allows ghost girl to continually try to accomplish her goal while also helping her out in other ways. It doesn't take long before these two girls become BFF's while also balancing out each other's personalities.Everything is going according to plan, but problems eventually arise. Ghost girl starts falling in love with the chef over time (which was not her intention), and living girl discovers that ghost girl's grudge may not be related to being a virgin at all. There's also an attractive career woman vying for the chef's affection that must be dealt with, and someone who might be inhabited by an evil spirit that eventually represents your main antagonist on several fronts. From there, it's just a matter of following along with the story to see how everything will play out.As usual, you need to give these K-dramas some breathing room to see how they evolve before casting judgement. The first few episodes are a little rocky but the story does settle in quickly, and it's mostly entertaining for the bulk of its run time.There's a lot to like about this story and this show, and it's helped greatly by the performance of the two lead actresses. I'm quite familiar with Park Bo-young (who portrays the living girl, and is the main star of the show), and she just kills it in a role that requires her to start out acting on opposite ends of the spectrum and slowly blending them into some middle ground over time. Kim Seul-gi plays the ghost girl, and this isn't the first time I've seen her play a bit of a manic character in a supporting role, but she's quite good at it, and somebody needs to give her shot at as a lead actress asap. These two actresses drive this show from start to finish, and they interact so well that you'd think they've been working together for years.Jo Jung-suk plays the chef and lead love interest. He's fairly likable and effective (especially when compared to the asshole head chef character portrayed in 'Pasta') and, of course, he's pretty easy on the eyes. The rest of the cast of characters not mentioned above consist of the \"ghost catcher\" lady with a soft spot for the ghost girl, an assortment of fit subordinate chef dudes ranging from reasonable to obnoxious and that get shirtless for no reason (other than to obviously appease the female viewers), along with a few others of import.This show utilizes several cooking related segments throughout, and a few ghostly special effects as needed, and while both of these of aspects are employed rather sparsely, they do serve their purpose. Production values are solid enough for this type of show, and it's competently written and directed as well (though you'll have to excuse the lack of rules of what a ghost can or can't do). There is a bit of lag during some of the middle episodes, but not so much that it doesn't comply with my number one rule for any K-drama (i.e. \"Don't Be Boring!\").Summary: Is it great?...Of course not!. But there are a number of things to like here. It does ultimately work quite well for what it is, it's also pretty well paced, and there's a nice mix of drama, humor, poignancy, suspense, love, etc. Personally, I thought it was very nicely done!Bottom Line: 8 out of 10 stars on the K-Drama scale!...Solidly Recommended!", "I've seen many, many dramas; many good, some bad, others just forgettable. There are those I consider great, as in classics. Dramas I've seen twice or more, and will probably watch yet again in the future. Which is saying something because these things are often like watching 16+ hour films. Secret Garden, My Girlfriend is a Gumiho, Lovely Kim Sam Soon, Hello Agashi, Cunning Single Lady, Healer, My Love From Another Star...well there are a bunch, and this is no exception.It's a bittersweet love story about moving on, letting go and overcoming obstacles. This drama nails the balance between humor, drama, thriller and the macabre. The acting, direction and writing are all top notch. The two actresses who star in the drama are stand outs - especially the main gal as she plays two completely different personalities flawlessly. If you are a fan of Korean dramas, or are new to the genre, this one is a fantastic watch. Highly recommend this one!!!", "Oh My Ghost! has a great premise of a young, shy, timid girl (Bong-Sun) who can see and even communicate with ghosts. Petrified and \"harassed,\" she finds herself constantly tired due to lack of sleep and doing her best to avoid these pesky spirits! She even goes so far as to cover the walls of her tiny apartment in talismans and anything else that might keep the spirits away.Enter Soon-Ae, a ghost who spends much of her time eluding the local shaman (Seobingo), who can not only see and interact with spirits, but she can catch them too!Bong-Sun works at a restaurant under a nationally recognized chef who is constantly scolding her for her lack of attention, lack of energy, and most importantly, her lack of confidence. Constantly apologizing, she drives Chef Kang crazy, as well as her co-workers. Once again, after being chased by Seobingo, Soon-Ae takes possession of Bong-Sun, and this is where the fun begins! Through the sudden habitation of Soon-Ae, Bong-Sun's personality is altered. She's confident, not shy at all, and even demonstrates innate cooking abilities, much to the shock and surprise of Chef Kang and his fellow cooks. Of course, the series is about how Bong-Sun and Chef Kang will come together, as he's completely caught off-guard by her sudden forwardness and flirtations. The series is a complete delight! I can't say enough about Bo-Young Park's performance. She's able to switch personalities of Bong-Su and being possessed by Soon-Ae with all of the deftness of a master at her craft. The beauty of this is that Park is equally charming in both \"roles.\" She is so cute and adorable, that you love her in either part. Her charm is what drives the series. Of course, there is also a mystery to be solved regarding Soon-Ae and how and why she died. Her story is just as interesting and intriguing as Bong-Sun's. In fact, it can be noted that her story is touching as well as tragic. So much so, that you may find it hard to choke back a few tears. Seul-Gi Kim does a magnificent job in this role. The series is a perfect balance and blend of drama, comedy, suspense, and romance. The four cooks who work under Kang are a perfect fit when a laugh is needed. They are hilarious and they work off each other so wonderfully. The entire cast is to be commended. There really isn't anything contrived at all in this series. The plot flows smoothly without anything feeling forced. I've seen too many plots where the writers and the director loses sight of the story and feels that they have to come up with something that is scarcely believable or plausible. Oh My Ghost! is a terrific series that you may have a hard time stopping after watching just one episode. You'll find yourself laughing a lot, shedding a few tears, and cheering in the end for Bong-Sun and Soon-Ae. Both of them realize that the key to Life is to Love. Because without it, Life is pretty dismal, whether you're alive or a ghost!", "This is one of the best korean drama i've ever watched! I really love Park Bo Young Characters! We can tell the difference when she plays the role of Na bong sun and the ghost. And for the Chef, he's so full of charisma! I'm starting to like him a lot <3 A lot of viewers are more liking the love between the ghost and chef. But i'm not. I really ship na bong sun and chef! Na bong sun really likes him a lot. She even made a scrap book about chef. And from my point of view, chef also likes her from the first time he saw her. At first, he acted like a bad guy because he thought that na bong sun shouldn't be a shy and always say 'sorry' to everything that she'd done. He didn't want her to be like him in the past who always got bullied by his school 'friends'. So he's hoping that she will do her best for herself. and this drama is really worth to watch. You won't be disappointed. OH MY GHOST, FIGHTING!", "I had never watched a Korean Drama before, I was scrolling on Netflix looking for something to watch for an hour to unwind and thought the premise sounded interesting. Then, I proceeded to watch as many episodes as possible until I fell unconscious. I did this for the next three days, everyday I got home from work. I was absolutely shattered but didn't care. Then, when I finished the series, I decided to go and watch my favourite parts over and over and over again. This is definitely in my top 10 favourite TV shows of all time. All the actors are amazing, Park Bo-Young is absolutely terrific at acting as two different characters. The cinematography was done perfectly, I cannot describe to you the emotion and the humour that some of these shots added. The plot, the mystery, the suspense! And, of course, the romance! It was unpredictable, original and made me blush, laugh and cry. I've been in such a cheery mood since watching it. All the different characters and their storylines, this show had so many layers. I don't want to hype it up too much, but I do absolutely love it and would recommend it if you want something that can be both fun and emotional.", "At first I thought this drama was okay for the first few episodes. As things got very intense I started to like it. Bo-Young Park really played an amazing job showing two different personalities in a professional and seamless change of a person being possessed. Her acting was definitely on point. The entire series really provided everything I like to see in a drama; Romance, Comedy, Supernatural (which was not too scary) and Crime. The story of everything really matched up and made me want to watch til everything was solved and investigations were lingering. Good series to watch and would recommend to see all the actors hard work and dedication for the outcome of this series.", "The story is about a cute girl named Na Bong-Sun (Park Bo-Young) who works at a restaurant, owned by famous star chef named Kang Sun-Woo (Cho Jung-Seok). Bong-Sun is quiet timid girl with an ability to see and communicate with ghost. The opposite of her, is Kang Sun-Woo, the good looking and confident guyOne day, Bong-Sun was possessed by the ghost, named Shin Soon-Ae who was trying to seduce Sun-Woo using Bong-Sun, believes by doing so, she can ascend to heaven before turning into evil spirit. Bong-Sung who was possessed, suddenly transformed into a girl with bright and confident trait, amuse those around her.The story then revolves around the mystery case of the death of Shin Soon-Ae almost 3 years ago and the love story between Bong-Sun and Sun-Woo. I like how the story tries to depict Bong-Sun growth and improvement of herself to be more confident. At first all the transformation is caused by Soon-Ae, but along the way, Bong-Sun meet a lot of different people and experience new thing that help her character to grow. This movies contain so much element, it is funny, romantic but not too cheesy, interesting character with plot and story intertwined with each other bring an unexpected element of surprise,moral of the story which is relatable with our life, superb acting from all the cast, nice character development, great OST music, etc.In short, this is one of my favourite Korean Drama, 16 episode, and you will find yourself entertained by it, give it a try!", "Thank You NETFLIX, I am more humble to see another awesome 16 episodes mini drama from Korea. First, it was IRIS, Black, LIVE and just finished with \"Oh My Ghost\". \nGreat story and casting, if you don't like the first 3 episodes. Then you are missing a wonderful story, it'll make you laugh, sad, cry and mystery. Don't watch it if you cry easily like me.\nEpisode 16 got me with 8 tissues that I had to dry my tears away.

I will await for sequels! Wishful thinking...", "This was a great viewing experience. The 16 episodes have everything you could ask for in a series. There was comedy, drama, mystery and suspense in just about every episode. The characters had depth and charisma. The actors were excellent. The view of Korean society was intriguing and educational.

If you love romance and feel good tv, this is a must watch!", "It's really refreshing to experience this series as a romance, tv-soap, spiritual ghost story and a crime thriller. They fit together so well it doesn't feel like anything in the story was made up like weird coincidences or odd conversations to skip any possible plot holes.", "I wasn't sure whether I should watch this drama or not. From the plot summery, it seemed like yet another bubbly K drama, with the cute girl getting into all shorts of trouble, but finally getting the boy. In this case the girl, the loner and with no self esteem sous chef Na Bong, has feelings for her chef, arrogant Sun Woo. But she only gets a chance with him after she is being possessed by a ghost. That's the main plot. Then there is the story of the ghost's past, her death (neither of which she can remember), and the complicated love triangle. There were some funny moments, though the romance wasn't that great, as you didn't know whether to like Na Bong or the ghost, but the whole mystery, bad guy chase really gave something to this drama. Of course it all resolves to Park Bo Young's acting. She can swift from one character to the other with great easiness that you can distinguish the ghost from the real person quickly. The whole cooking theme was a great idea as well, as it gave a nice atmosphere to the drama. So 6 out of 10."], "473": [], "474": ["From the beginning, I imagined a really cheesy plot and in honesty, that's something I'm a fan of.

There aren't that many episodes to play around with and I'm glad it wasn't dragged out. I feel like the message was portrayed pretty well and I must admit, I was in tears pretty much throughout. The acting is fabulous and I would generally recommend this title.However... the ending could have been a lot smoother. I feel like a ridiculous amount of questions could be asked rather than any of them being answered - that's my only reason for a lower rating.

Boy, was I wrong. I don't think I've cried this much watching a show since descendants of the sun, which says a lot since I bawled like a baby watching that show.

I didn't even like the female lead at first either, I honestly just cam to see Myungsoo's pretty face. However I was pleasantly surprised and caught off guard by some of the plot decisions. The female lead became the complex character I wanted her to be in a way I hadn't imagined it happening. For a short drama it turned out to be a really good watch, there were no useless episodes, and it had my feelings in a twist by the 3rd episode.

I would definitely say the acting was good, sometimes even great. and as for the script, there weren't any supper cringe worthy lines or anything, also there were some surprisingly funny moments from minor characters and our male lead.There are some tiny details in the show that don't get fully addressed, but hardly enough to dissatisfy a viewer.Honestly with a little bit of tweaking this could've been a 10/10 drama, but for now 8 thirty minute episodes isn't too risky of an investment to try out a decent show.", "I'm watching the show for a second time now, and it's still an amazing show.

I still tear up time and time again.The ending where it's \"will they or won't they? Off-and-on again love, does Da-in remember Tan?\" is very frustrating at first, but I think repeated viewings make it more enjoyable and fits the story quite well.I love everything about this show and i will watch it from time to time again and again.

In great dramas like Empress Ki or Secret Garden, she does a superb job playing impressive, tough women. In this drama, she's not only beautiful, but her personality sparkles and she is super cute. If you want a great drama, look elsewhere, but if you want to spend time with a fictional version of the real Ha Ji Won, this is a way to do it. This drama is just a vehicle for her to shine on the screen.", "This is quite a disappointment for me since Ha Jiwon is such a talented actress. I blame the script that no talented actor can save. There was no real tension and the flashbacks were just there to make the structure of the plot avoid taking a linear progression. For me, a linear storytelling technique is acceptable as long as the story is captivating. Scriptwriters need not do the non-linear technique all the time just to appeal to the modern-day sophisticated viewers.

When I realized who the serial killer was, the script revealed it, too. Not like: \"Gosh, I'm so smart! How come the others didn't seen it!\" Genial. But the plot goes on. So are the surprises.

A must see.The story seems pretty straightforward and quite easy to get into. A cross between Cinderella and she's the man. The synopsis tells the story.But this is not a Hollywood made show.It goes much deeper than that. Where this show truly excels is portraying the relationships of the different characters in the show. Maybe its my Asian background. But the way they portray it and decisions made comes so close to my own experiences that its downright scary and also very touching.I guess it explains the huge success of the show...who ever watched this. They will see a parallel to their own situation. From a difficult relationship between a father and a son, to a mother trying to balance her need to find a new partner and her duty towards her daughters.To me it was the start of the boyfriend-girlfriend relationship between EunChan and KanKyul. It mirrors my own experience so closely. The calling game, the little games you play with each other that could lead to misunderstandings and fights. And all this because you are afraid of the strong feelings you have for another person. Not knowing how to express it or how the other person feels about you. The beautiful thing is...they take there time to portray this and it works real well.Where Hollywood stops with just the love story, this shows continues exploring and portraying the relationship behind the lovestory.I can't recommend this how highly enough. A must see.", "The First Shop Of Coffee Prince is about the life of Go Eun Chan.It is not easy; she works many jobs to pay off debts and even gave up her feminine image. Choi Han Kyul is the heir of a big food company, but his grandmother wants him to settle down, so she arranged many dates for him. After Eun Chan bumped into Han Kyul and was mistaken for a boy, Han Kyul decided to hire Eun Chan to be his gay lover in order to avoid the arranged dates. Desperately in need of money, Eun Chan had no choice but to accept. Han Kyul's grandmother also made Han Kyul in charge of a filthy coffee shop in danger of being bankrupt. Eun Chan begged to work at the coffee shop, and not long after, feelings start to spark, except, how would Han Kyul accept his \"homosexuality\"?It took me a while to get into this drama as I felt that it dragged in its early episodes. But as I went through viewing it, there is no doubt that this is a CLASSIC DRAMA. The First Shop of the Coffee Prince provides refreshing themes about homosexuality, self-sacrifice, hard work,dreams,ambition,success,emotional and psychological issues that one may face in life. The story is one-of-a-kind and not your typical Asian drama.Yoon Eun Hye,playing the tomboyish Eun Chan, played her role extremely well. Her chemistry with Goong Yoo, who played the confused Choi Han Kyul,is commendable too. Their chemistry was excellent. Both deserved their MBC acting awards for their work in this drama. The supporting cast is commendable as well. Aside from that, the soundtrack was magnificent. A must-see Korean drama!!!!!!", "Let's start off with the weirdest thing. I'm Dutch, have no relationship with anything or anyone Korean, I just like Anime and J-Pop/K-pop. While browsing through Netflix I came upon this gem. When I started first watching this show, about a week ago, I thought \"fudge it\". I never saw a Korean TV-series before with real actors, apart from the occasional Korean movie involving lots of fighting. \"Coffee Prince\" was my first encounter with a Korean TV-series and boy, what a treat this is!As other reviewers have explained, this is all about the girl- needs-job, pretends-to-be-boy, falls-for-boss. The amazing thing about it is that these actors actually take you along their fantastic ride. At no point in this series I felt they were over-acting. Every single actor is able to portray his character well and they truly develop throughout the series. This is no As The World Turns. ATWT doesn't even come close. This is real drama. You really feel with these actors, I even forgot they are actors at times! The episodes also take their time, running for an hour or longer which gives the actors and director time to really dig deep into their characters and situations. Characters develop during an episode and even more so over the course of the series.The struggle between the two main characters is a back-and-forth, a push-and-pull. Sometimes a tad annoying because you really want them to work things out and get together. But the things happening to them and in their relationship often provide roadblocks which must be overcome for them to go forward. The ways they deal with those roadblocks are recognizable for a normal human being. Nobody get's shot because they cheated. This is real drama.This series is totally captivating and had me interested until the last second. I only wish they would've made an episode about the marriage of the main characters too (and yes, I'm a man saying that...). It would've been the ultimate ending to the series if you ask me.", "The Coffee Prince shows love can cross boundaries (gender, economic status) and triumph. The love story is beautifully portrayed and makes Coffee Prince worth watching.The two leads embody the main characters perfectly. Gong Yoo plays Choi Han-gyul, a rich aimless man and Yoon Eun-hye plays Go Eun-chan, a hard- working breadwinner for her family. Eun-chan does not look or dress in a feminine fashion and Han-gyul mistakes her for a boy. Their initial relationship is based on Han-gyul paying Eun-chan to act as his boyfriend to repulse the blind dates his Grandmother and Mother set him up with, as they want him to settle down and marry. Han-gyul then is challenged to make a decrepit coffee shop profitable in 3 months (as co-owner) and Eun-chan gets a job in the coffee shop. It is wonderful to watch their ensuing friendship and love blossom. Han-gyul struggles with his love for Eun-chan as it challenges his concepts that love should only between a man- and a woman. The lead actor, Gong Yoo, goes all-in on his character, Han-gyul, playing crucial moments with intensity and elevating the entire drama. The lead actress, Yoon Eun-hye, manages to be sympathetic as her character Eun-chan continues her gender lie longer than necessary. The supporting characters of the drama did not grab me so their on- screen stories were not of much interest, lowering the overall of the effect of Coffee Prince as a whole. *SPOILER* When Han-gyul finally allows himself to love Eun-chan regardless of gender (episode 10) it is the best moment of the drama and truly touching. *SPOILER* The finale episode is the weakest as we wait too long for the couple to be reunited, but all ends well.", "OK. I watched this show for the first time in 2015. I was 15. I had just been whipped into phase of watching Korean Dramas by one of my good friends. Compared to the first Korean show I watched, which I also loved but for other reasons (Boys Over Flowers), this show seemed so much more genuine. (I have not included spoilers about events but I might have included spoilers about different character's characteristics. If that makes any sense.)First of all, the relationships weren't outlandish. There is no extreme hate between any of the characters in the show. No arch nemesis. The parents/grand parents are more reasonable when it comes to the romance of the main characters than any other K drama I have seen thus far. The supporting relationship in the show is a refreshing, long lasting love between reasonable, authentic adult characters, which, understandably has some hiccups along the way. Second, the characters weren't to the extremes. I have seen so many dramas with bratty chaebol sons who wear expensive clothing and drive fast cars. Han Kyul is rich and spoiled, but his wealth is toned down so that he is a believable character. Eun Chan was believable too. She didn't beat up people twice her size and the actor wasn't fighting too hard to pass as male. She seemed natural and cool. Sure there are some wacky characters in this show, Mr. Hong, Ha Rim, Sun Ki and Min Yeob, but none of them do extremely garish things which ruin the mood of the show. Third, Gong Yoo is just great, isn't he? He is a very handsome individual and I quite like the ensemble of different facial expressions that he can pull (my favorite is the raised eyebrows). Plus, he still looks great ten years later!Fourth, Yun Eun Hye is terrific as this 24 year old tomboy. Her chemistry with Gong Yoo has not been surpassed by anyone in any other the other shows or movies I have seen him in. I must admit, after watching this, I haven't been able to bring myself to watch any other shows that she is in. I see her as such a boy, and without the short hair and masculine tendencies, her performance in other shows and movies always leaves me feeling a bit empty.The plot kept me on the edge of my seat right up until the end. I'm only docking one point. Half a point because the ending is lacking some, and even though I've watched the show through a few times, I'm always hoping there is something extra that I missed at the end. Plus another half a point for the scenes which I feel are unnecessary and cumbersome to the plot, like Sun Ki's story (sorry Sun Ki).", "I am not a fan of K-Drama, but am a huge fan of this show. Have watched the entire show 4 times so far and always want to come back to it. The scenes are so original you might think it wasn't in a movie.2007 ~ 2018 and haven't had enough to it. Made me think there was something wrong in me but I'm still fine, I wouldn't mind even if I do though.I don't know about the others, but it hurts so bad to know that there will be no 2nd season to this show. It really hurts.", "All though almost all Korean Dramas are great but this One of the best out there. Must watch for all.", "This was the very first Korean drama I watched. After this one I was hooked! Everything about this K-drama was awesome; the cast, the story, the characters. I will definitely re-watch this one again and again! It will get you hooked! Absolutely loved the ending, too!!!", "I found the first few few episodes annoying.. BUT after the 5th episode, I got hooked.. It is so beautiful, the chemistry between the two main leads is amazing.. Love is love, it has no boundaries..\nWatch it.", "Best kiss ever\nFemale lead is cute and male lead is handsome.\nLove it.", "I first watched this show in 2009 then again in 2010 and I am still so impressed by it .Not only is it a very good Kdrama ,its generally just a very good series/miniseries which can stand its own with any international series out there. Its a comedy (mostly of errors ,mixed up identity and confused emotions) but it has a lot of touching ,sad and heartfelt scenes. It also makes a pretty big statement about romantic love and its basis which had me thinking long after it was over", "Coffee Prince follows the footsteps of so many dramas that have a girl dressed as a boy, but manages to be unique and fresh. And those last two qualities make this drama a classic. First of all, the story: a young girl, who is often confused for a boy, manages to get a job at a cafe, ran by a rich spoiled heir. But, in order to get the job, she needs to pretend to be a boy. All in all, it is an okay film. The main story is interesting and entertaining, though the love triangle wasn't that good, maybe because it ended too soon for the main female lead and therefor it lost its strength early on. Plus, the secondary stories were just there to fill the gaps. Honestly, I thought they will forget about them and never show us what happened to them, but they managed to wrapped them up pretty neatly at the final episode. The romance was okay, though it failed to convince at the ending. Fortunately, the girl didn't miraculously changed into a princess of girly power, as all the other girls do in dramas like this one, but she remained herself and that was the main thing that separates coffee prince from the other dramas. Finally, the plot was just okay, with the episodes sometimes being a little boring, as the action didn't precede."], "484": ["I've been watching movies and television for over 40 years. I only recently got into some Japanese and Korean shows. One of the best that I've ever seen was \"Descendants of the Sun.\"My Love Eun Dong starts off with a great premise of a young high school boy who meets a 13-year-old girl who changes his life and how he lives it in a most profound way. It's clear that there is a love there, but she is suddenly forced to move away with her step-parents. Ten years later, they meet again, and as they finally strike up a relationship, Eundong disappears, leaving Hyunsoo heartbroken and wondering what ever became of her.Another ten years go by, and Hyunsoo, who is now one of Korea's top actors, uses his fame and influence to try and find Eundong. What Hyunsoo and Eundong both end up discovering is a web of lies and fabrication by her current husband and his mother, as well as her own step-parents, because Eundong has lost her memory due to an accident, and so she is \"given\" false memories to maintain the charade of what really happened. As the story gets going and becomes intriguing to the viewer to find out how Eundong will get her memory back and reunite with Hyunsoo, it suddenly collapses like a house of cards by unsympathetic and largely unlikable characters as well as too much melodrama. There's enough melodrama to fill three seasons of any regular show.I will say that the performances are very well acted, despite nearly all of them playing characters with such weak and mostly unlikable personalities.The stand out here is Jaeho. He is the only paraplegic character that I've ever seen who is about as cowardly and despicable as the worst villains in any TV show or movie that I have seen. The director tries to make the viewer sympathize with him, but he's devoid of anything approaching having \"good\" character qualities except for how he treats his son. Eundong is a woman who is unable to truly think for herself and find her own power within. She makes decisions mostly based on what others tell her to do. She suffers from being abused by others largely because she has little self-respect and self-esteem. She's a woman with a big heart for everyone but herself.And Hyunsoo, the character that we're supposed to sympathize with as much as Eundong, is an immature lout who barks orders at everyone, including Eundong. He's a 30+ year old man who acts like a teenager. He has fits of temper that would turn off any woman who had any self- respect. There are a number of scenes that make you wonder how Eundong could ever be with someone like that, but after seeing Eundong's own issues, it's not hard to understand.The acting and production are well done, but the story and characters, which had so much potential, largely fail across the board. This isn't romantic or loving, as the story tries to make the viewer believe. This is about power and control, two things that have nothing to do with love. You wade through half of the series waiting for things to work out, and then finding at the end, a very empty and unfulfilling resolution, which causes the viewer to say, \"I watched this whole thing for this?!\"If you want to see a Korean production worthy of your time with memorable, likable characters, and love that has integrity and value, I highly recommend \"Descendants of the Sun.\" Don't waste your time with this one.", "I found this series on Netflix and it is re titled \"This Is My Love\". I enjoyed the 16 episodes a lot. The male lead, Ju Jin Mo, is a great actor who is able to convey his emotions very well. The scenes portraying the hero and heroines in their youth and as young adults were wonderful too.", "If you don't want to watch a love story, then don't watch this drama, because it's a pure example of the genre. It's about two people who meet as young teenagers, then are separated. The guy spends the next 20 years looking for his lost love. The lead characters are played by 3 different actors/actresses in 3 time periods ten years apart.The adult actress is Kim Sa Rang, who was Miss Korea in 2000, and is still a beauty.. It's a really sweet story, one that hooked me on k-drama, and if you like this genre, you should like the series. Reviews on other sites were much more positive than the ones on this site.", "My friend recommend this drama to me or i will not watch it. The female lead is not pretty is only the 2nd lead in secret garden. Male lead is a bit too fat. But turn out the male lead's acting is superb. Second male lead act equally good. To be a false and handicapped husband, his look is not kind of typical villian, but is a sick man that will arouse your sympatby. The 2 marks is deducted because i do not appreciate very much acting of female lead. Seems she is of the same expression for most of the time.But overall it is still a splendid drama. The plot is creative and is not illogical. Once you begin you cannot stop seeing it.", "I found the story difficult, to use the term, difficult to swallow. On the premise that a young man fell in love with such a young schoolgirl very questionable, and to pursue this 'love' to later in life I'm sure would give many an expert, psychologist a field day. The lead female character had my sympathy, as I felt she was manipulated to everyones ends. No, although well filmed and acted, I didn't feel good watching this drama, hence low rating"], "485": ["When I watched the first episode I was hooked into it, thinking it will be a drama relating to court politics and occasionally some action. The action did come but the politics were mere child's play. Many questions remained unclear, many plots didn't make sense. Maybe the subtitle didn't do justice but the story itself lacked charisma. If not the court politics, then martial art and charisma of the protagonist could have made up for it. The only thing that made me rate it 6, is all those randomly popping philosophies and compromises made for love.", "Usually, period dramas are a bit boring, especially when they exceed the 16 episodes barrier. However, this one, kept the interest high till the end. Sure, the mystery wasn't that good, as it was easy to figure out. But, the whole bad politics plot was entertaining, with lots of action scenes and very realistic costumes and settings. The performances were great, and probably that's the main reason why this one gets 8 out of 10 from me. The love story was okay, though, it got a bit tiring towards the end, plus, they didn't seem to have chemistry at first. But, it worked out eventually, so that helped with the love triangle as well. Overall, 8 out of 10.", "This story is a bit scary. Hour, after hour of Asian entertainment on Netflix. And they all tell the same story, although densely populated the Asian countries have only a handful of individuals. The rest is just a mass that requires food and shelter from the king in order to worship him. And make no mistake, the king is not an individual either, he is only the provider and the slave to their whims and happiness.", "I think the Story Writer hasted at the first part that's why many things were missing and the first part was mediocrethings started to get interesting and more realistic after Crown prince's father died.

The story follows 4 main characters; two show Producing Directors (PD's) in their mid-thirties, a younger PD intern, and a young singer-idol, that all work in the Korean entertainment industry in some capacity. The show follows the personal & professional lives of these people, and those people around them, while mixing comedy, romance, and drama amongst them.'The Producers' starts off a little unevenly but everything settles in quickly enough, and this show really takes off during episodes 3-4however, it is important to mention that this show also changed directors around this time (in what has to be one of the most ironic cases of life imitating art I've ever seen). There is a change in tone that comes with the change of directors, but it's not unusual for K-dramas to have tonal shifts like this anyway. I rather liked the basic groundwork the first director implemented, but I really enjoyed where the second director took the story once the baton was passed.The main cast is great. The 2 older PD's are played by actor Cha Tae Hyun and actress Gong Hyo Jin. The young PD intern is played by actor Kim Soo Hyun, and the idol-singer is played by idol-singer IU. If you don't recognize all 4 of these people, you're not paying nearly enough attention to the Korean entertainment industry as you should be. Tae Hyun & Hyo Jin are both highly experienced and seemingly so at ease with any role they are tasked with; as expected, they each do very good work here, both separately and together, and they play off one other extremely well. As for the younger stars; all the Korean girls know who Soo Hyun is by now, and every Korean under the age of 50 knows who IU is at this point. I particularly enjoyed watching these two play mostly against type; he as the shy & awkward guy, and she as the alter ego version of her own public persona.Supporting cast is rock solid, as is the story, writing, direction, production values, and just about everything else going on with this show. The soundtrack is terrific and very well implemented, and the endless amount of guest stars, cameos, name dropping, career stories, inside jokes, and so forth, is nothing short of spectacular. The camera angles can be a bit off putting at times due to the purposeful intent to portray a typical K-drama as some sort of reality show about people working on reality showsit's often reminiscent to how the British/American show 'The Office' was shot in this aspect.The last K-drama I can think of that was similarly hyped as 'The Producer' was 'You Who Came From The Stars', and ironically, both shows feature Kim Soo Hyun in a leading role. Both shows share a common quality aside from that actor though, and that is they are each somewhat polarizing \"Love It or Hate It\" type shows. I wasn't particularly a fan of 'You Who Came From The Stars', though I didn't outright hate it nor did I give it a scathing review. I've heard and read a lot of comments from many viewers who loved 'YWCFTS' (and similar type shows) however, that just do not like 'The Producers' at all; they find 'The Producers' boring, not melodramatic enough, don't like how Soo Hyun's character is portrayed, etcthey don't think 'The Producers' is as good as everyone thinks it is. But, these people are wrong, because 'The Producers' is goodreally good.This show seems not to care which direction the audience wants the show to go in...it's going to tell its story the way they want. Of course, if the ratings would have stunk, that wouldn't have been the case. I like this approach A LOT and I'd like to see it done more often. It pleases me greatly that this show was well received by many viewersnot just because I liked it and want others to agree, but because Korean TV desperately needs dramas like this to be successful. I've always felt that more diversity was in order within the K-drama world, and this show is quite different from the norm in so many ways. It still retains a K-drama feel and format, but I think this could be a pivotal show in helping change the industry for the better. Not every K-drama show needs to be (virtually) the same story over and over again in order to be accepted, and KTV land might find an audience they never even knew existed if they continue to try taking a more intelligent and adult approach to some of these shows. As for those of you who didn't like the show for the reasons mentioned in the previous paragraphGet over it!...There are hundreds of shows that fit your preferred criteria both past & present, and I can assure you that's not going to change (nor should it) anytime soon.Summary: Personally, I loved it!...There's no question it's quite well done overall, and it is jammed packed full of extra goodies for long time fans of the Korean entertainment industry. And, if you happen to like both Korean variety/reality shows & K-dramas, it's a real treat. It might not work all that well for the younger generation or those expecting a traditional K-drama format; it is often dialogue heavy, story driven, and very light on the flashiness and epic love story melodrama. In the end, it's just different, and that is perhaps its greatest attribute. Bottom Line: 8.5 out of 10 stars!...VERY WELL RECOMMENDED!", "Outrageously brave. This series is not centered around love, but rather the sincerity behind love. Cindy's charm, Joon-Mo's heart, Ye-Jin's honesty, and Seung-Chan's caring, these beautiful elements are what make our imagination fertile, and our hearts race. These beautiful elements, are the manifestation of our sincerity. A great drama.", "Even though the producers is a short drama (only twelve episodes!) and most of the story is occupied by the variety shows and the mentions of the celebrities that were currently the talk of the city, the rest of the drama was satisfying enough. The main story is the struggles of a rookie PD who works on a sinking variety show. Now, the romance was so-so, but, thankfully, it developed the way I wanted it to develop ( I can't describe it better as I'll give away too many spoilers). Anyway, the chemistry between the rookie PD and his senior wasn't that good in order for the drama to have a strong romantic vibe. But I did loved the female leads performance, even though the rookie PD was a little awkward and I would have liked for him to have done a better job if possible. IU was okay, but I haven't watched her yet on other dramas so I don't know if she can do better. Another thing that bothered me was the constant mentions on variety shows and celebs. I knew some of them, so I could keep up, but if someone didn't, I think it would have been awkward for him to watch this drama, though it wouldn't effect the main plot or made it difficult to keep up. But, all in all, I did enjoy the multiple stories that overlapped one another and the drama was entertaining enough to keep the interest high till the end.

First of all, the story: a girl, who's a vampire, tries to hide her true identity in her high school. In the meantime, the most popular boy in her school falls for her. But the problem is that he hates vampires. And so, when he finds out about her secret, he gets into an accident and gets amnesia. That's season 1. Season 2 is about the same characters, only they are now living in the past. The guy is a scholar and an aristocrat and the girl is a butcher's daughter and a vampire as well. They eventually fall in love, but they are stuck into a vampire-human war. After that, we move on to the last season (each season is about four episodes or so, as the drama has only 12 episodes!). In the 3rd season, we are back in the modern world, where the boy still can't remember the girl, who volunteers for a programme, where she has to reveal her vampire identity to the world and try to live along with the humans, who don't accept her. Okay, the concept was good. I particularly liked the second and the third season (well, half of it), as they were quite interesting. The first season felt too rushed, and, as I was ignorant to the fact that the drama was divided into three seasons, I was surprised that the story was concluded in episode 3! An other thing that didn't work for me, was the band concept. I thought it was childish and too unrealistic, not that they weren't talented, but to get to be idols?? In addition, the performances were so so. The female lead wasn't good, especially in the first season, but got a little better towards the end. The second male lead was surprisingly good, and I liked his story and his whole appearance of this bad boy vampire. The male lead was good as well, but that was expected. The costumes were really nice, and, surprisingly, the special effects were realistic enough.

But the main interest is the bulling. In this drama, it is handled carefully. showing all the forms that is can take and all its results. And for me, that was the best part of the drama. The love story, actually the love triangle that it develops between the girl, her sister's best friend, and the outcast of her high school, is really good, but it fails to be completed, as the final episode leaves you a little confused.

However, I think there is some real charm within this. The first few episodes are definitely quite cringy, and I definitely considered dropping it after the first 3-4, however, the middle of the series isn't too bad. If you can make it to around episode 6, then you can pretty much finish this off without it being too cringe. The last couple of episodes - the last one in particular - were extremely well done.

There was a lot where EXO could have done more with their acting, there was a lot where Gayoung could have toned down Inchul Gal a lot more as well. I don't know where the line was drawn between being way too much and way too little. This isn't to knock the acting at all, don't get me wrong - I think all actors and actresses did really well with what they were given for the show, I think the script and character writing could have just balanced it out a bit more. I keep saying this does have a bit of a cringe factor, and truth is, if the characters had been toned down a notch or toned up a notch then I think that wouldn't have occurred - this is my own personal opinion, I know quite a few people who love it how it is.This is a show that definitely has charms. When I say it has a potential rewatch factor, there are some episodes I will definitely watch again, namely the last three. I wouldn't watch the entire season again, it's too much - especially the first few episodes. The storyline was well written, but again, it all came down to the characters themselves on why I wasn't too keen on this. Incheon Gal was way too over the top; I know she was supposed to be but it did quite get on my nerves.All in all, I think at least every EXO-L should give this a try. My bias list is in tatters, I laughed and cried my way through it and - surprisingly - a member of EXO doesn't die in this one! A rarity!", "A sort drama (only ten to fifteen minutes per episode) staring the boy band EXO and even though someone would expect it to be just a badly covered advertisement for the band and maybe some products as well, it surprisingly isn't. The story is nice and funny as well: four members of the band move next door to a girl's house. The girl is forced to become their cleaning lady by her mother. All the while, Chanyeol is trying to find a locket that his grandfather had left to change his bad luck and D.O. falls for her. Okay, the main thing that bothered me was the girl's face. When she liked a guy or got embarrassed it turned red...well more like hot pink alien like. That was simply too weird and silly. Plus, the locket thing was really silly as well. But you can't expect much from a drama like this one, so you should just overlook those faults and just enjoy the drama. And sure enough, it is a funny drama and it can be watched from a non fan as well as fans (I'm not a fan and I enjoyed it and my friend who's an exo L also liked it so I think it goes both ways...). Plus, the romance was good, with the love triangle nice enough, and the band drama was convincing enough. All in all, a must see for exo fans, an entertaining drama for a quiet afternoon (or two).", "Exo next door is a very good show. It is really funny and entertaining. You should watch it!

However, the drama started falling apart after the first half. The romance was not as strong, as the guy constantly made the girl cry, and the girl simply and very idiotically, for me at least, kept coming back.

You can't say this about an awful lot of series, especially not ones within the horror genre. In that regard the series deserves lots of credit but at the same time it also isn't exactly a movie series that stands out with great movies in it. All of them are quite average but certainly original and watchable enough to check out. Also as standalone movies, fore the series its movies aren't really connected to each other story- or character-wise.It perhaps isn't fair to call this movie an horror, since it actually focuses far more on the mystery and dramatic elements of the story. This has basically been the case with every movie out of its series but yet they keep on advertising it as Asian horror because that simply is the popular thing to do. It would also be hard to advertise it in any other way really and find the right target audience for this movie. It's a hard sell because all of these movies are basically such unique and original ones within its genre. That's why I always keep enjoying these movies and wouldn't mind seeing more of them being made in the near future. As of yet this remains the last one out of the series but there is no reason to stop here really. There is still plenty of ground to explore and new, different, approaches to take on its concept.But having said this; I don't regard \"Yeo-go-goi-dam 5 - Dong-ban-ja-sal\" as an all too solid movie. Out of all the movies this one has probably the most simple script, even though toward the end the movie becomes overly complicated again. It might be because the movie is 'borrowing' too much from its previous movies. The characters are all the same again, even though its a fresh new story with new characters and actors in it and also the way the movie progresses is quite predictable, especially when you've already seen some of the previous movies out of the series. The movie reminded me a bit too much of the first and the third movie; \"Yeogo goedam\" and \"Yeogo goedam 3: Yeowoo gyedan\", which does perhaps makes this a bit of a redundant entry within its series, that doesn't add enough new things.The movie is still good though. It has a pleasant buildup, which is slow but steadily and with every minute starts to show more and more of what is going exactly. In that regard this movie works far better as a mystery than an horror really, even though the movie still has plenty of scares and also bloody moments in it.Thing that didn't worked as well were its actors. Out of all the movies within its series this one probably featured the worst actors in it. Or perhaps it was the directing, since every movie out of the series had featured young, inexperienced actors in it, of which some had never acted before and also never again.It's still a steady movie, that also helps to keep the series a steady one.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "Series of American films, with special emphasis on those concerning the horror genre, are usually known by their apparent tendency to repetition and rapidly exhausting the originality sometimes achieved in the first film. The series Whispering Corridors is however the opposite of this American tendency, being apparently able in five films and ten years after to keep a simple premise and combining differently terror adjacent to ghost stories.Contrary to some of the previous films in the series, A Blood Pledge clearly proposes itself explicitly as an horror movie, investing in concrete elements supposed to scare the viewer, and limiting in an obvious way the investment in the history plot. The film follows the possibly least interesting and most generic of the arguments registered in the series, although being the first that considers the topic of group suicide among students in Korea. The characters are particularly uninteresting (especially the main protagonist and the ghost), with ineffective and exaggerated acting being often registered. The explanation of the events is done in a slow pace, with no particular final twist (as commonly observed in the current panorama of classic Asian cinema). A Blood Pledge stands out as the first film repeating obvious elements previously used in the series, recurring to a few acceptably well done scares under the clear influence of Ringu. A wide range (not guaranteeing its effectiveness) of special effects is also used, usually with an unreasonable exaggeration of blood and a few laughable moments of attempt of terror (special emphasis on an exploding head...). All in all, A Blood Pledge still provides a good entertainment, but is merely a simplistic horror movie devoid of anything even considered remotely interesting.Original review : http://asian-cineblog.blogspot.fr/2012/11/a-blood-pledge.html", "If this movie teaches you nothing else, you will walk away saying there are some shady females out there. If you've seen all the other films, you will be happy to learn that this one is just as good as the rest. This and the 4th film are best in my opinion. Check it out. Great addition in the series.", "The Blood Pledge is the fifth film of the South Korean horror series Whispering Corridors, where the only thing in common threading through all the films, are its predominantly female cast, its setting in an all girls high school, the dabbling with ghouls and spirits, and the context of urban myths and legends being spread through the gossip sessions along the corridors of schools, from which the anthology got its title from. All stories so far are different, and so are the characters, so in truth, you can watch this as a standalone film.But it's not so much of a horror film, than a study into the psyche of the female of the species. Can I understand it? Certainly, as far as identifying common and distinctive behavioral patterns go. I would call this film, and probably the series, a girly-girl's film, not because of its cast, but rather having plenty of girly moments that before you label me sexist, think about it - girls will probably understand just what this is all about from its premise to the character motivations, while the guys, I suppose we're probably happy with the eye candy on display, rather than to sweat about the stuff that we don't understand because we're wired differently.Take for instance, we don't fathom why the girls behave the way they do, with friendship treated so frivolously, in one moment you can befriend someone, and because of cliques and the want to belong to another group, you've got to burn bridges with others just so as to demonstrate group loyalty. Then there's the usual petty fights and arguments about grades, the stealing of boyfriends, gee wheez! the whole nine yards of schoolyard problems, magnified because you've got arguing school girls trying to assert their influence on one another. Here, there are 5 of them making up the core group, and a lot more from the outside playing supporting characters, which in turn makes it a pretty noisy, active school with the students doing everything but study.The tale begins with 4 students - Soy (Son Eun-seo), Eon-ju (Jang Kyeong-ah), Eugene (Oh Yeon-seo, don't ask why the masculine character name) and Eun-yeong (Song Min-jeong) making a pact to commit suicides together. Well, if there's the existence of suicide clubs, then this idea and premise isn't all that far fetched, though their motivations to do so are kept under wraps for the time being. Meeting at a chapel and making the titular blood pledge where they are to die together, things get messy when only Eon-ju ended up killing herself, which leads to the rest being spooked because they fail to keep their end of the bargain. Witnessed by Eon-Ju's youngest sister Jeong-eon (Yu Shin-ae), she begins to bug the rest into providing answers, which of course isn't forthcoming, in order to provide narrative legs for the film.Now just how one can form such a pact is beyond me, and so are things like running to your BFF and telling her everything, and I mean everything, about the problems one is facing. Perhaps it's a guy thing to put up a strong front and not break down uncontrollably while figuring out solutions to problems, but in this case it is this confiding that perhaps laid the foundation for being continuously spooked. That said, this is not a horror film per se, as the ghoul hear appears in the day and at night, being much more like a guardian angel to keep her BFF away from trouble, and to inflict pain upon those that have ill intention toward a BFF. I suppose such a friend is for keeps, since he/she ensures some level of protection even when belonging to another realm altogether.Writer-director Lee Jong-yong follows the tried and tested formula in Asian horror narrative, always giving out a little clue at a time as the story progresses, while dealing with the background of each of the characters, whether or not they contribute to the story directly. The scares here are pretty expected, with heavy reliance on sudden movements, in-your-face appearances, and dastardly makeup in other to elicit the fear factor, but seasoned genre audiences won't find your hair standing at all, being rather intrigued by the female talent on display here. After all, this franchise is famed for having some of its alumni progress into blockbusters and award winning films, with the likes of Song Ji-hyo from Wishing Stairs making that starring role as the Queen in A Frozen Flower, and more recently, Kim OK-bin from Voice making her big art-house break as the bullied wife turned vampire in Thirst. It's anyone's guess now who amongst the ensemble here will progress much faster than the rest.", "Friendship, love and jealousy are the three themes that thrive in this particular horror film, although don't let that fool you into thinking that lesbianism has anything to do with the plot, as it has previously. Familial love, love between two best friends, and love of academia and succeeding are frequently prominent. Set in an all girl's school (like the former titles), the film focuses upon Jeong-eon (Shin-ae Yu), who waits for her sister Eon-ju (Kyeong-ah Jang) outside of a building one night, only to have her tragically commit suicide by throwing herself from the roof of the same building.But was it really suicide? The mystery behind this event is the driving force that keeps the viewer entertained in this incredibly complex story that is slowly revealed overtime in the form of flashbacks. The audience continuously remains uncertain of what led to the tragic circumstance, the way the truth is hidden been one of the strongest aspects of the feature.Unlike the previous Whispering Corridors films, where we already have preconceptions regarding the deceased student from having previously witnessed her, in this feature, the first time we see Eon-ju is during the final seconds leading up to her demise. From the beginning, viewers are made aware Eon-ju's death is related to a suicide pact three best friends, So-Hee (Eun-seo Son), Yoo-jin (Yeon-su Oh) and Eun-yeong (Min-jeong Song) form, swearing that whoever does not partake in the ritual will inevitably be haunted by those who took their lives. Eon Ju's return as a ghost, haunting these young ladies, immediately makes it clear that she was somehow involved, and Jeong-eon is equally suspicious, continuously pressing So-Hee, Eon-ju's best friend, for answers. The secrecy between these three friends after Eon-ju's suicide leads the school body to conceive slanderous rumors about what may have happened.Despite the friendship between So-Hee, Yoo-jin and Eun-yeong been fleshed out, the connection between sisters Jeong-eon and Eon-ju is not, and for the most part they seem like total strangers. Despite Jeong-eon's dedication to uncovering the truth, she sometimes appears less emotionally traumatized than one may imagine, while it is So-Hee who seems to bear a number of emotional scars, making their friendship appear more legitimate.One of the biggest flaws in A Blood Pledge is its repetitive nature. Often, the film depicts the three friends communing together, then shows one of them been attacked verbally by students who blame them for Eon-ju's death, before revealing a scene where Jeon-eon confronts So-Hee, this series of events happening more than once over the course of the film, although occasionally the order is arranged in an alternative format. Besides this, there are a couple of decent jump scares that take place over the course of the plot, but at the same time, more than one of them has been previously encountered in former Whispering Corridors films, causing them to feel predictably stale.For the most part. A Blood Pledge plays out similarly to a revenge story, where the ghost of the deceased returns to wreck havoc upon those who wronged them. At the same time, there is one particular occurrence that transpires during the friendship between Eun-ju and So-Hee (you'll recognize it when you encounter it readers!) that is largely unexplained, the impact of which is quite mountainous when it comes to some of their later decisions. Although at times beautiful, the lackluster degree of information provided in this circumstance prohibits the audience from becoming further involved.Furthermore, the motivations behind a number of the deaths that transpire over the course of the feature are seldom provided sufficient detail on why it is they died. Though by the end we are able to make assumptions behind why these potentially occurred, it may have been beneficial to have a more detailed explanation. Moreover, the relationship between So-Hee and boyfriend Ki-Ho may have also benefited from additional material, and Ki-Ho's mother, who later becomes involved, deserved additional screen time too.By the end, when the truth is finally revealed, though the sadness exhibited during this scene is incredibly powerful, it is not enough to adequately benefit the entirety of the film as a whole. If not for the repetitiveness, and if greater focus was emphasized on characters who, in contrast with the three friends, were largely overshadowed, the plot's depth would have been greatly strengthened. Where former Whispering Corridors films employed scenarios and ideas that caused them to feel uniquely fresh and entertaining, A Blood Pledge sacrifices originality for overused and sometimes clich\u00e9 scenes and ideas that could inevitably be described as 'safe'. For a franchise that has made a habit of pushing the boundaries of horror, safety is the one element Whispering Corridors does not require."], "520": [], "521": [], "522": ["Hogu makes women and children feel safe and happy. \nAll men should be like Hogu. \nA man with a heart.

It is a mix of history and fiction in telling the story of a South Korean spy agent who goes to North Korea under the guise of a businessman through China in order to infiltrate North Korea in search of information about the nuclear program.The movie's biggest strength is in the cinematography portraying the different locales of China, South Korea, and North Korea in its story telling and in the acting pulling in a cast of well established Korean actors. The camera work and soundtrack is also excellent which work together perfectly in creating high tension key points in the story and providing the movie with excellent pacing.The story is for the most part is more straight forward than what I expected from a spy thriller. It gets more political after the second half of the movie which is expected due to the nature of story between North and South Korea and it adds a level of complexity.

I'm not going to talk about filming and directing as I know nothing about all that. I will tell you about what I saw and more importantly what I felt. First, let me say I've been a big fan of Korean dramas for the past few years. I have never thought much of Ji Sung prior to this. I thought that his acting skills were okay/moderate in his previous dramas. Either he had never previously been given the opportunity to really flex his skills or he has matured with experience over the years. I was blown away by his performance in Kill Me Heal Me. It would be an ambitious project for any actor to portray 7 distinctly different personalities. He not only does so but accomplishes it with such depth that you actually forget that they are \"personalities.\" You begin to see them as separate people and grow attached to each character. You feel their pain and joy and root for every single one of them. This bond with the characters, without giving away any plot points is a crucial factor in the emotional roller coaster journey throughout the drama to its conclusion. Ji Sung's skills were so incredible that it got to the point where you are able to identify the personality switch just by minute changes in his facial expression even without dialog, hair and clothing changes. I cannot say enough about the amazing performance he put forward in this project. Whether you are a fan of the story or not, you can't help but admire what he accomplished with this. If he doesn't win the Daesang for this, there is something seriously wrong with the judging system. The rest of the cast, Hwang Jung-Eum, Park Seo-Joon and the other supporting actors all give strong performances and there are no weak links. By that I mean, you don't feel let down or bored as the plot line switches to secondary plot threads. You will laugh and cry hard in this drama. For those of you not accustomed to the Korean style of humor in many dramas, it can sometimes get slapstick and over the top which is not everyone's cup of tea. However the humor in this drama will appeal universally. There are moments that will make you laugh so much you will cry and then there are others that will break your heart and make you cry for real.If you are looking for something that is a scientifically accurate portrayal of multiple personality disorder and you are going to nitpick every little inconsistency, then skip this. However if you are looking for a drama that you can lose yourself in, and one that will make you FEEL. Then watch this, you won't be disappointed.", "If you are reading this review, you probably might be interested in watching this TV show.I hope this review will change the \"might be\" part to \"must be\" \ud83d\ude02 Okay then!! kill me heal me, is one of those rare shows that is packed with almost all kind of emotions you look for in a good show. Suspense, mystery, romance, comedy and what not?! You will laugh, cry,smile, scream, go like \"wtf\" through out your journey with this show. This drama never loses its plot. It has an amazing story line. Plus the acting by all the actors is so on point. Ji Sung couldn't have played the role of a person suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder any better. He maintains an amazing balance between all his personalities. And trust me, you are going to admire all of them. While falling completely for his aggressive personality \"Shin Se Gi\". He even transforms into a 17 year old girl, \"Yo Na\". She is a total fun to watch. The actress of this drama, Oh ri jin, is again a very charming character. She is a psychiatrist by profession and secretly treats Cha do Hyun, who wants to hide his disorder from the world. Oh ri on is another beautiful character to watch out for. He plays the role of Oh ri jin's twin brother in the series, and there is no way that you won't end up feeling his plight by the end of this show.

I think only Ji Sung could have done justice to the role.Actress Hwang Jung-eum also played her part well. The chemistry between both leads was excellent. Other support casts were good too. The music is excellent too!!This drama showcases Child Abuse and its effects.You will never get bored of any scenes or episodes.The lead pair must act in more dramas together. In this drama they were paired for the second time.This drama is a must watch!", "Kill me, heal me is an odd drama, in every way. First of all, it has an odd story that goes deeper and deeper, with plots and twists and more personalities jumping up from everywhere. And then there is the fact that unlike most dramas that start strong and then they flop towards the ending, this one starts badly and has a strong ending (wow talking about an odd drama!!) Okay, this one reminded me of the good old days when I was watching She was pretty and the entertainer (same actors, all favourites of mine!!). The story also brought back memories of the drama It's okay, it's love, though the later was dealing with mental health issues better and more in depth, even though Kill me, heal me deals more with children abuse. The story is nice, with a guy who has several personalities, all different (even a seventeen old girl!) who hires a personal doctor to help him keep them under control and not get caught by his family. In the meantime, the background story of them both is being revealed. The performances were on the point and really great, especially from the lead actor, who was amazing with changing his personality from a suicidal teen to a bad boy adventurer. The soundtrack was nice, but the same song kept playing over and over and it started getting annoying in the end. Plus the romance was weak, but the drama focused on the background story more than the romance so it was okay to not have the strong love story. I'm not sure if there was a love triangle in this one (SPOILER was her \"brother\" in love with her?) though it would have been unnecessary if there was. But only because it got boring in the middle and the beginning was weak, I'll rate this one 6 out of 10.", "How time has past since the completion of this surprisingly awesome drama.A lot of the time I thought it terribly realistic how each character played there part and yes Ji Sung especially.It gives you a peek at how some one could; actually suffer with D I D but in this story ends with a happy ending which you know I thought.... may be; could this work???? \"Wishful thinking\".Thank you all so much for acting so well.Aroha to all; be safe and live well. (Hwang Jung Eum) my favourite Korean Actress.", "To me, this drama is perfect, in the entertainment point of view. Jisung is at his height, in turn of his outlook and acting skills. So smart in his suit as a wealthy third generation of a great family. Female lead is equally terrific, acting as a always pleasant and witty doctor.Needless to say, the plot excel among all other kdramas, portraying Jisung as a DID patient with 7 personalities. One of his identities as a girl is impressive, with him wearing pink dress running around the street.In turn if we judge from medical point of view I think female lead is quite professional as a psychiatry. I like her way of treating different identities as friends to help Jisung, and give them each a gift before they are leaving.Not until I hear an interview of an actual DID patient in my place. He is discontented with many of the movies and dramas which usually portray their identities as harmful and aggressive. In fact, according to him, that is not the case in real.This is my only negative comment to kmhm. Otherwise in entertaining aspect, it is beyond doubt a perfect drama.", "They must pay you people to write these positive reviews this was so hard to watch and what do they do when KD needs an American actor find the worse actor on the planet, also unlike Korean men American men don't cry when we get our ass kicked.", "One of my favorite series, especially best casting and story line. each episode had a curiosity of what gonna happen next, and what had happened before, that made us watch the series at a stretch. Nowadays only \"Kill me heal me\" background music is in my playlist, got addicted to the music, even i don't understand the language, the music and the scenes made a huge impact to me. Only after watching this series i saw Ji Sung's other series, apart from other series this is his best i would say.", "After I watched the drama. I couldn't go on without praising the main lead role. Ji sung one actor but played many roles. He also admitted that he was struggle because of his roles but he still managed to come through and gave us the best show. Thank you Ji sung.", "Usually I'm a king of a person who reads reviews and then watch a show or a movie so this will be my first review because I really loved the creator's perspective of Dissociative identity disorder .When i saw this particular drama I wasn't expecting much but the way unveiling of each personality in him made the story very interesting . He wanted to save her so badly , she was everything that he had so when he lost her he ended up created characters which signifies each and every bit of her memories.in him... he was so full of it.In fact its intriguing why did he do it ?? Is it just because he wanted to protect her or couldn't handle the pain of losing her......or may be both."], "533": [], "534": [], "535": [], "536": [], "537": [], "538": [], "539": [], "540": [], "541": [], "542": ["I don't understand the low ratings for this movie. I saw this film when it premiered at the Busan International Film Festival and was impressed. It's one of the first Korean movies I've seen that actually made me laugh, and had some heart. Plus it has been a huge critical and commercial hit in Korea, so I'm surprised there aren't more Korean movie fans on here giving it positive reviews!For those looking to get into Korean cinema this movie offers a nice alternative from the dark films that Korea tends to be known for internationally. While I enjoy some of these darker films like Oldboy, Mother, and I Saw the Devil, it's refreshing to see a Korean film that doesn't leave you feeling sick or depressed after the curtain falls.This movie has the usual themes covered in coming of age stories, but also deals with other issues relevant to modern Korean society, such as the treatment of foreign laborers and the disabled by a Korean culture that isn't always welcoming to outsiders. All that said, the highlight of this movie is the relationship between Wan Deuki and his teacher. This is the source of a great deal of humor and warmth throughout the movie, and will make you laugh out loud more than other Korean movie I can think of. Even if you are unfamiliar with Korean culture and cinema, if you watch this you won't be disappointed. Don't be fooled by the low IMDb rating of this film, check it out!", "If I had to summarize this (complex) film, I would write \"It takes a village to raise a child---and the world is our village and we are all its children.\" I watch a lot of Asian cinema, since I am an American Buddhist. Most of the Korean films which I have enjoyed have been dark/suspenseful/supernatural. This movie is not like any other Korean film that I have watched, but it is a lot like the Japanese classic \"Ping Pong\" and it is a lot like American coming of age films such as \"The Freshman\", \"Breaking Away\" and \"The Graduate\" and the Australian movies \"Muriel's Wedding\" and \"Strictly Ballroom\", i.e. there are plenty of belly laughs, a few tearful moments and a sense that what you are watching is universal.Anyone who watches this looking for another \"Shamo\" (I love Shamo, btw) or similar martial arts film will be disappointed. While it starts on a downer note, it ends on a spiritual/emotional/intellectual high. I can not praise it highly enough. I makes me feel good inside knowing that it was a commercial hit in Korea---means there are a lot of good hearted people in Korea. I am definitely going to look for more films by the writer/director.", "excellent Korean warm-up-your-heart movie. a lonely teenager, a struggling father, a crazy high school teacher, a timid but loving immigrant mother. this movie is a great example of how the Korean movies are sometimes superior to other Asian countries movies. you have to transcend the difference of the cultures to know that at the bottom of all human hearts, parental love is the most important thing to all the kids. all the children cannot and would not grow up to be a happy person if their parents are separated or divorced, because once the unity is broken, shattered like a mirror, none of the family member would find a complete image of their own. this is a wonderful Korean movie that i fully appreciated and enjoyed, because it showed us the other side of the rich facade of a developing country, poor and dirty neighborhood, the forever shanty town with struggling majority population of all the countries everywhere in the world. the screenplay writer(s), like painter, drawing a water color painting full of vivid scenes and people, and turned it out to be a masterpiece.", "It makes me weird why they put PUNCH for its international title, just put WANDEUKI (taegukki?) its more suitable! Maybe its a metaphor, that boy use his punch to change his life! (right?).What a superb director and screenwriter?! They can put on many character and they developed them well until we get nailed to know each character's story. This movie actually not depict a life of zero-boy who become hero after joined kickboxing (cliche?). This is heartwarming movie, mixed of many theme - drama,comedy,lovey dovey,religious,action. Whaaa... they did so well.Its hard to find a live action movie without antagonist (except ghibli) nowadays. I recommend you this stuff. I tell you some synopsis, its about a poor-stupid boy who have no friend,no girlfriend,money,no mommy and his main plan how to get all that important stuff. Exciting... do I make you excited?", "This movie goes in a pretty much generic direction when it comes to a Korean teacher trying to help out a student that feels all alone and gets into trouble. With some romance for both characters thrown in. Which is a shame cause from the trailer, I was expecting some unexpected and yet effective drama with some good amount of humor. The humor is just really bland in this movie and the story isn't anything special. The only thing that stands out is how there are actually these types of students living in Korea so it can be relatable. The building of the bond between the student and the teacher goes in a pretty much narrow direction. I was more interested in the romance between the teacher and the next door neighbor. But that was disappointing as well. Overall this is a disappointing movie about a teacher trying to motivate a student.3.8/10"], "543": [], "544": ["The drama has everything - great script, amazing casts, perfect OST and fast paced. It will keep you invested from start to finish. It's a mix of action, drama, romance and mystery. I got totally hooked! I didn't got bored even for a second. Every single episode got me at the edge of my seat and I was just thirsty for more.Ji Chang Wook, Park Min Young have a good chemistry. I simply enjoyed in every single romantic scene of them as they had the chemistry right up to my taste. You are going to love Yoo Ji Tae also. There acting is top notch.I did not regret watching this drama. One of the best Korean dramas I have ever watched!", "I decided to watch Healer because of my friend. She was absolutely crazy about it at the time it aired, and it was hard not to be interested while listening to her talking about it.I suppose I should mention that I wasn't quite sure about the main leads at first. I watched Park Min Young in two dramas before (City Hunter and Sungkyunkwan Scandal), and although I didn't dislike her, I wouldn't plan to go out of my way to watch her. My first encounter with Ji Chang Wook was when he guested in Running Man, during which although he was handsome, he hardly appeared as attractive.Good for me, I tried to keep being open-minded. Apart from letting myself be affected by my friend's suggestion, I also watched a cut from an episode to see the chemistry between the two main leads. It didn't completely convince me, but enough to sense a certain level of their chemistry together - which I actually liked.So at a certain point, I kind of felt it was time and gave it a go. I kept my pace of one episode a day at first, not quite know what to expect. The first struck of emotion for me was in episode 6, then it bloomed in episode 8, and from then on it was pretty much an one-way street, I couldn't go back anymore. Some days I watched two, or even three episodes at a time. My friend said, \"Well, that sounds about right\".The thing I liked the most about Healer, surprisingly or not at all, was the chemistry between Seo Jung Hoo/Park Bong Soo (Ji Chang Wook) and Chae Young Shin (Park Min Young) in the drama. They gave me lots of feels. I forgot them in real life and immersed myself completely into that fantasy world. It was rare since I hadn't been able to totally get into the mood of any Korean dramas as of late, let alone feel the romance and believe it was real. This pair broke the stuffy and frustrating air I was feeling for the past 3 years about Korean dramas in general. It was lovely, adorable, light, trusting. When you see those two, you simply genuinely want them to be together, not because they went through a lot and they needed to be together just for the sake of it, but because they deserve each other. Whenever I saw them, it made me all light up inside. Fluttering. Happy.Apart from the OTP (one true pairing), it appeared to me that everyone who took part in the project was putting their all in it, and they worked so amazing in harmony together that it also reflected on screen. Both Ji Chang Wook and Park Min Young were passionate about their parts, they gave lots of suggestions and really tried to understand their characters. For Ji Chang Wook's character - Seo Jung Hoo/Park Bong Soo, I think we're bound to love him. It was a guy who was strong and intelligent and brave, and at the same time had this dorky and awkward side to social interactions (especially to Young Shin's father) that was super duper cute. For Park Min Young's character - Chae Young Shin, she did this type of character before but for the first time ever, something was different. She had a certain depth and comfort that made it easy and pleasant to watch. It felt like something just clicked. I get annoyed easily with unnecessarily silly and naive characters, but this time I actually liked Chae Young Shin a lot, simply because it wasn't that type. It was true she needed to be protected, yet to me it seemed that you didn't need to be strong all the time. If something was out of your reach and ability, it would be better to leave it to people who could handle it instead of fighting blindly no matter what. What would be wrong with receiving help when needed? Young Shin was brave whenever the situation called for. It led me to believe that the script was written logically after much thought. I'm pretty sure many people will have withdrawal symptoms after watching Healer, so I would recommend you to find what the writer Song Ji Na as well as the assistant writers had to say about it, plus listen to dramabeans podcast about Healer too. Also for the first time since forever, Healer managed to get my brain working on the insights it provided. What a feast.Now when I listen to Healer main theme song, it makes me want to go run through the rooftops. And when the first line in Eternal Love by Michael Learns to Rock turns up, I can't help but agree, yes, \"It's a beautiful feeling\"...", "Finally watched a rare Kdrama that doesn't look like an anime acting... Fit for western viewers also... Top calibre actors/ actresses, and support roles & even the extra characters!.... NO dull/dragging moments, I don't even notice the time that on every episode it's already over (cause 1 hour per episode)... You will really stay on your sit and focus cause you don't wanna miss a thing.... Great production and cinematography, as well the simplicity of their fashion....This may have some similar story BUT it is the plot and the flow that makes it different... Great and sexy action stunts, not too brutal Well balanced: comedy, action and ROMANCE--- that every woman's dream to have Healer in their lives!!.. I love the story line, the humor and their confrontation-- so Intense!!... Adding up the musical score and the OST, then it makes the feeling and the conveyance of the story complete!!... For me, I won't get tired of watching this over and over again...MUST WATCH it's really a classic!!", "Top 5 Korean drama i ever watched before. Episode 1 maybe slightly confusing and doesn't make you want to watch more. But trust me, continue watching it. You won't regret.Watched it twice in a row without feeling any bored. As if like you knew what will be the next scene but you still feel excited for it. Highly recommend to watch it.Healer=Action+Politic+Romance+Laugh+Super good looking actor/actressStill trying hard to stop watching it because it is really addicting! Watch it guys, you won't regret!:D", "I watched city hunter, My Love from Another A Star, and a couple more Korean Drama based on ratings that I see. Healer to me, is the best of all the ones I've seen so far. Again, Because Korean drama is so long, I do not want to waste time watching so so one. So I always read reviews and ratings first before I watch the drama. Healer has everything. Great casts, great story line, with funny, romantic and action scenes combined equally. If you are looking for a good Korean drama and haven't watch this movie, watch this. You won't be disappointed. When I watched City Hunter, I literally got bored with some of Lee Min Ho's scenes that I fast forwarded a bunch of episodes. This movie kept me hooked and wanted more. It is No clich\u00e9, very down to earth.Ji Chang Wook and Park Min Young are meant for each other. I will watch another movie if they are both paired again in it. You just want to cheer them and be happy for them.", "I really love this TV series. At first I thought it's boring because of it's cover (lol) but I tried to read reviews and comments about it, then almost all of them are pretty good. I also find it boring because of the title, I'm expecting that his a healer, literally speaking. But then, I tried to watch episode one, I don't get hooked or interested at first but I continue to watch it anyway. So there, the more episode I watch, the more I get hooked by its plot. Omg. The feels, I can't find a word to explain how good it was. Its really worth it. The plot, characters, twist, OST, is so perfect, really. Their chemistry is really amazing. So much feels. I don't think I can find a better Kdrama than this one. I hope they can make another story as beautiful like this. So yes, try watching this, I'm telling you, this is WORTH IT.", "OK I don't usually write review but i cannot wait to let everybody about this amazing drama. I don't know what to write. It has a good combination of action, comedy, suspense, a little bit of romance which is good coz I don't really like romance movie. But this additional romance is good and appropriate. First, the acting is very good especially the male lead is so awesome. The action is also nice, full of park-our. It makes me laughed, cried, awed, worried, angry, sad, etc. Haiz I don't know what to say, just watch it yourself then u will know. This series although has 20 episodes, it doesn't make me bored at all. It doesn't have unnecessary filler too. Just watch it. Recommended!!", "I just adore this drama. It was really intriguing (usually I m not a big fan of dramas but this is the only drama where everything was perfect and it kept me going). I just loved the whole casting team and the story!! Also the background songs were great as well!! Once you finish the drama it stays in your head for about weeks it's very hard to forget about it. It's just totally amazing!I would definitely recommend people to watch it especially those who are new to Korean dramas. I am sure they will love it as much as I do. I am going to start watching more of Ji Chang Wook's drama I m sure they will be great but I will miss his chemistry with park min young. They were the best couple.", "I've been watching korean dramas since last year. I read the reviews for Healer and decided to watch it. At first I thought it would be boring and just wanted to know why it had great reviews. Thank God I watched it. It has become my all time favorite shows ever korean or otherwise. It has drama, suspense, comedy, action, and one of the best romance in korean dramas. Ji Chang Wook is such an amazing actor to be able to transform from being healer to park bong soo. Park Min Young is a great actress and so lovable as Chae Young Shin. Thet both have such great chemistry and one of the best romance in any korean drama. Both their back stories is heart wrenching and emotional. It has some great comedic scenes too. I saw a comment somewhere saying Healer is a low-key superhero and its soo true. Such a wonderful show and so glad I watched it. Please don't miss out on this show.", "Applause for this one! I have almost gotten used to the unavoidable cliches and exaggerated humor that adorns just about every Korean series that I've seen so far and I am genuinely surprised when I find a series that has the least amount of them. I am even fine with the cliches themselves when done well, and just about everything here is done well. At some point I noticed the little running ''Healer silhouette'' drawing that shows up at the end of an episode and I liked it so much and I was thinking to myself how I never noticed it before... But if I want to find fault I could, but even so, the atmosphere is too good, the intrigue is too good, the moodiness and the romance... My salute to Ji Chang Wook and his ability to make things palpable... P.S. that slap in the 19th (or 20th) episode was epic.. I had a fit of laughter.", "This ticks all the boxesAction, chemistry, story, acting, romance, cinematography, ost. Jcw and Pmy were terrific as the leads. Never boring.Definitely In my top 5 tv shows let alone kdramas.", "End was really unsatisfactory and somewhat childish, more because of the build up which was so great. If ACTION, CRIME, DRAMA is your genre, this show is amazing. For a heads up, there is some good ROMANCE too. \nIt's a BINGE WATCH if you like that or not.", "I've watched over a hundred kdramas, and this is in my top 5. It's a little complicated at times going back and forth between events today and most of the same characters 20 years ago, but it hangs together, has great action scenes and a very nice romance. Also a great soundtrack. Totally recommended.", "I love this drama it's got action and romance which I love.

I was skeptical of the cast and I had kept myself from watching for so long, then I ran out of something to watch and decided to finally sit through 20 episodes. It was epic. And I mean epic. Amazing.\nGreat acting, amazing insane script.... how much i woupd love to meet this writer. I am so in love witg the chemistry between the lead actors and their superman kind of love story. \nNo regrets. I will rewatch it for the next few months. I also liked one song.

And would have loved to see the very end of \"the elder\" and his team.", "The drama has nothing - worst script, tatti cast, tatti OST, and slow paced. it will make you demotivated from start to finish. Its mix of poor direction , script writing and production.\nDON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE WATCHING THIS!WATCH HOLLYWOOD.", "If i count only first half of the drama i will give 10. Male lead is a high tech super hero. This is quite a unique role as compared to typical rich guy male lead in kdrama.

The storyline is no longer as exciting and logical as in first half.It has an amazing soundtrack, though."], "545": [], "546": [], "547": [], "548": [], "549": [], "550": ["This is one of the best K-dramas I've seen so far. Most of the summaries are not very good, but it's hard to tell what it is about without giving any spoilers. But I'll say that it's not an usual clich\u00e9 drama with a lot of romance and no real plot. The story here is very intense and well written till the end. It's about death, revenge, mystery,... But there's obviously romance too, like in all k- drama there's a love/hate kinda story that will make you giggle. The actors are great, you can't expect something else with Park shin-hye and Lee jong-suk, they are awesome. What I mostly liked about this drama besides all of what I've said is that it's pretty mature without being TOO serious and depressive, it still has humor. You will cry and you will laugh, it's a emotional roller coaster and I suggest it to everyone!", "Pinocchio is a very well crafted story about just how much the media effects people, as seen through the eyes of our main protagonist, Dal-Po. There is also a very nice romance in there.The main thing I enjoyed about Pinocchio was how well it was able to balance drama and comedy. The main story was where the drama came from, and was kept in the arc of the main characters. The main characters did have some comedic moments, but most of the comedy was kept to the side characters, which I liked. This was one of those rare shows where you really got to know and like the side characters. I also enjoyed how unique the story was. There aren't too many shows about what goes in the world of journalism. If I must nitpick, I have to say that I wish they would've cut out some of those clich\u00e9 moments. Yes I know that Korean Dramas are well known for being soap opera-like, and that those moments very rarely occur in this drama. However, it really took out of the realism of it all when there is a long and silent stare while a ballad plays in the background.This was the first Korean Drama I ever watched, and I'm glad of it. If you are trying to get into Korean Drama, this is a good place to start.", "I love this series so much. It has a fictional premise of the Pinocchio syndrome, but that didn't take away from the series for me.The actors did such great jobs of portraying their characters, so much so that I am forever doomed to be in love with Dal-po.This series made me laugh and also tear up - in short, it did its job very well! It was also a great suspense story.Recommended.", "I'm fairly new to personally following K Dramas, though I've been exposed to them for about ten years now. Park Shin-Hye has been in many other dramas, but in this one she is so very likable. I find it amazing when actors can plan characters over long stretches of time and that is exactly what Park Shin-Hye and Lee Jong-Suk are able to do believably. I'm in the middle of the serial but was compelled to write a review in support of this drama. VERY likable and realistic characters. Minor characters, too, are well-played. I'm enjoying the show and can honestly say that it is worth a watch. The relationship between Choi In Ha (Lee Jong-Suk) and In Ha (Park Shin-Hye) is long-term and complicated. It's fun to watch the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Even those early years with Park Jong-Suk and his wig are entertaining. I give this drama seven stars because there is always room for improvement. But I'm loving it.", "Like both the lead couple. Plot is sophisficated. Worth a watch.", "In Pinocchio, we assume that there is a syndrome that prevents you from lying. But the main focus of the drama is the power of the media and the way a story can be presented as to manipulate the public opinion. So the main story is about a guy who's family was ruined by a manipulated news story that presented his father as criminal. After he was adopted by an old man who had lost his own older son, he becomes a journalist and he seeks revenge from the reporter that created the false story. All the while, he has become the uncle of that reporter's daughter (his step father is her grandfather), who has the Pinocchio syndrome, but wants to become a reporter anyway. Well, the story is quite good and entertaining, and the romance is nice, even though in the end gets a little boring. Especially the two last episodes were really blunt, as the story was summed up in the episode 19th and it was stretched till the 20th. So, if it wasn't for those two final episodes, this drama would have been much much better. So, because of the great performances and the fact that, fortunately, the flash backs were handled beautifully and they didn't tire the audience.", "I LOVED this KDrama. One of the best plots, acting, and motivations. The first 13 episodes or so were the best you could ever see. The overall plot involves revenge, wrapped in a romance, where the two leads who disliked each other since kids, somehow lived together till adulthood.The two individuals are not realated by blood, but she does call the male protagonist uncle. They both decide to become reporters, but the male lead is a hidden genius who for plot reasons, hid his intelligence.SO there is essentially two archs. The guys plot was fantastic, moving and very much the crutch of the story. But around episode 13, everything seems to drag on as the females plot starts. It gets very tiresome...and really feels as if this was meant to be a 15 episode story rather than the 21 or so it is.TO sum it up, the fist 13 episodes are a 10, and he back end of the episodes score a 6 for me.I still gave it a 10, because those first 13 episodes are so great. And the MUSIC is incredible. There are some great plot twists and the cute kdrama moments. So I think it's worth the watch and/or purchase.", "I tried it because of Lee Yu Bi (a fine actress). But I get stuck every now and then simply because of plot holes.\nThis drama surely had potential with a good story line and some good acting but... some serious lacking in direction and screenplay. It was poorly edited. They didn't gave damn to get the story straight or keep the fact right. A good story always need some research and survey. This drama totally lacks it. Funny how it's full of contradiction.\nYou will get a fresh romance and some good thrill but not a well balance story.", "Episodes are too long. So after some time i lost all my interest.

Our leading lady is fat. Point and laugh at her everyone, she's fat!Laughing yet? Well the show is. Every single person she meets is repulsed by her, her in-laws treat her like garbage and they keep having her fall, break the chair she's sitting on or sweat so much her armpits are literally see-through.\nBecause how dare she be fat.... laughing yet?\nAs repulsive as the first episode is the show finds it's footing after that. I thought it would be a simple Rom-com with her getting everything back after becoming beautiful... which was the intention of the first 5 episodes.\nThen the plot become overly convoluted and twisted. It was trying to be Cinderella + pretty woman, then decided to be Count of Monte Cristo but ended up with something closer to a Jekyll / Hyde story with way too many character reveals and filler. What happened to the light hearted fluff I was watching?\nI started off hating this show for all the fat shaming and cruelty that board lined on childish. More so because \"fat\" Sa Geum Ran was really cute as is. The plastic surgery thin = beautiful wasn't needed.\nThe show kept me interested once that part was over and we move pass it. I ended up loving AND hating everyone which just shows how good the actors are. The plot however is the weak causing the actors to work even harder to sell it.\nI'm glad I watched it.

The reason I gave it a 9 and not a 10 is the last episode forced a lot of loose ends to be tied up somewhat hastily and implausibly. It could have benefited from three more episodes to maintain the dramatic tension and the integrity of the plot. That said, the other 20 episodes did not disappoint.Korean jurisprudence differs from that of the U.S., so it may take a few episodes for an American viewer to understand what the characters' roles are on the Incheon Public Safety Prosecution team that is the centerpiece of this story. I'm still not entirely clear on how they were able to stay on the cold case homicide that is central to the plot, not even counting the obstructions thrown in their way by shadowy figures in the fictitious chaebol (megacorporation), Hwa Yeong.I find myself watching this repeatedly, looking for clues hidden in plain sight that I'd missed previously. It's in Korean, a language I don't know, with English subtitles. I've been watching on broadcast TV and a couple different online platforms, and the style and quality of the subtitling varies from one platform to another, so that's also a driving factor in me watching it repeatedly. However, the main reason for me to watch it more than once, is that it's eminently watchable.The cinematography and editing are more like a movie than a TV drama. The performances are terrific, especially Choi Min-Soo as the lead characters' boss, Mun Hui-Man. The music complements the visuals, the script and the acting superbly.My only caveat with this show is make sure you have the time to give it your full attention.

Featuring structures of the traditional 'bildungsroman', snapshots into the grueling lives of salary-men and office politics, the show intertwines these concepts with humour, emotion, reflectiveness, wisdom, finely executed through a fitting soundtrack, impeccable cinematography and directing and outstanding acting. A solid show thematically, it handles with great sensitivity and deftness the many delicately captured aspects of human nature and society. The characters and their development throughout the story are extremely well written and by far one of the most impressive aspects of the show, fleshed out by the complexity and subtle nuance of the relationships depicted. Entirely believable in both their strengths and vulnerabilities, the show allows an audience to connect with the characters on a very fundamental level. You will find something of yourself, or someone that you know reflected in the characters of the show, the persistent underdog in Gurae who struggles against all odds, the talented but down to earth Young Yi whose exceptional ability as a woman incurs the resentment of her colleagues, the at first seemingly stoic Oh Sang Sik who over the course of the show reveals his deep capacity for empathy and self-sacrifice. Even the 'villains' are never clich\u00e9, one-dimensional cardboard cutouts to fill a gap in the story, but all serve towards Misaeng's intimate and moving exploration of the human condition. Misaeng shows many aspects of mundane life, but never itself, becomes mundane, taking the viewer on a at times beautifully poignant, vividly evocative and greatly inspiring journey from start to finish. As I believe this is a show that leaves a viewer of any demographic something to take away, I'd urge anyone reading this to give it a try. For me, Misaeng certainly gave another small unexpected fragment to the missing pieces of my 'incomplete life.'", "So far, I have seen three Korean dramas that have blown me away. \"Descendants of the Sun,\" \"Stranger,\" and now \"Misaeng.\" \"Misaeng\" is about four interns, hoping to secure jobs in the Korean trading company, One International. Those unfamiliar with how Koreans do business may easily find themselves intrigued and sometimes disgusted with the Korean working environment. Still mostly a male dominated work environment, you will see that it is still a difficult and challenging place for women to break into. Being verbally abused, and even occasionally sexually harassed, despite the company guidelines forbidding it, women take on the challenge of having to \"put up with it\" while trying to climb the corporate ladder.A group of interns are working at One International with the hope of securing a permanent position through a contract offer. Of course, the four interns that the series focuses on, all come from different backgrounds and have differing personality traits. What makes them interesting is that they are all complex characters, causing the viewer to find certain things endearing about each one as well as things you may be turned off by. Sounds like real life, right? And that is just one of the charms that makes this series work so well.First, we have Geu-Rae, a highly introverted young man, who doesn't have much of an educational background. His resume is full of small, part-time jobs that cause his fellow interns to contemptuously wonder how he got the internship in the first place. Especially contemptuous is fellow intern, Baek-Gi. Unknown to most of his co-workers and even his supervisors, Geu-Rae is a champion in the classic game of bad-uk (Go). Somehow, he is able to utilize bad-uk strategies to help him solve problems. He is also able to take criticisms without taking them personally. He knows he's there due to connections, and not because of any ability that he has. Geu-Rae, therefore, knows that he has to prove himself by working even harder than any of the other interns. Next is Young-yi, portrayed by the beautifully capable So-ra Kang as the only female intern. She is dedicated, and she already has much knowledge about the trading business. She is also able to speak several languages fluently. However, she has to take the abuse from her male colleagues, forcing her to do nothing more than retrieve coffee, get their shoes cleaned, and so forth. Somehow, she is able to do these things long enough to prove to them, that she's highly capable and only wants to serve and support her team. I cannot imagine how it must be for a Korean woman trying to succeed in such an environment where she is derided and taking constant abuse. To make matters worse, her own father tells her that he regrets that she wasn't born a boy. Baek-Gi is the ambitious intern who is a bit prim and proper. He's a bit arrogant, and feels that certain jobs are beneath him. It takes him a while to understand why there is a learning curve in place and also to learn how to be humble and supportive. When Geu-rae, at one point, appears to be getting more recognition than him, Baek-Gi doesn't take it well as his resentment builds toward Geu-rae...until he finally learns the truth about Geu-rae's past. Baek-Gi starts off as a very unlikable character, but he quickly grows on you.Seok Ryul is the wild, passionate, and somewhat lazy intern, who'd rather spend his time gawking at girls than working. However, his strength lies in his knowledge of the working factory man; the blue collar workers who \"slave away,\" often in unfavorable conditions and with outdated equipment, in the company factories. He's also a bit resistant to authority, especially if he feels that he's being taken advantage of. However, he loves his fellow interns, and his friendship with all of them is important to him.The power of this series is in the relationships between, not only the interns, but also with their co-workers. These are people who spend more time with each other than with their own families. Comradery is important to them , and they often work late hours or go out for drinks together after work.The heart and soul of this series, rests with Mr. Sang-shik Oh (stellar performance by Sung-min Lee, who all but steals the series!), who is Geu-rae's boss of Sales Team Three. At first, Mr. Oh is reluctant and even a bit hesitant to help Geu-rae learn the job due to his lack of qualifications and experience. However, upon seeing Geu-rae's willingness to learn the job as well as his determination, Mr. Oh relents. More than that, he takes Geu-rae under his wing, and we quickly find that the two characters have a love and a respect for each other that is quite touching and heart-warming. Geu-rae, who has been alone much of his life, finds a \"father-figure\" in Mr. Oh. We see our cast of characters dealing with one obstacle after another, as they struggle in the workplace; a place that is sometimes friendly, sometimes hostile, and always competitive. The stories are first-rate as well as the actors who bring these fascinating characters to light. You'll laugh, you'll cheer, and you'll occasionally even find yourself choking back tears. You'll quickly adhere yourself to characters that you love, and despise those that you don't. In the end, I think most people would love to have a boss like Mr. Oh who demonstrates wonderful integrity, despite the back-dealings, and money-grubbing traits of many of the greedy managers around him. He looks after all of the interns, and he has no problem \"tripping\" those who abuse them in very funny situations. Misaeng shouldn't be missed or overlooked. This series has it all.", "I can't keep writing and talking, and writing and talking, and writing and talking about Misaeng over and over again for days. I must say if u have'nt watch this drama, go watch it !! it's a drama that i rarely seen on k-drama world. i can't stop thinking about the motivations behind the characters, about how certain events complicated others, about how to put it all together. It's just well written, well directed and well prepared in details The ending it self it's so..... reasonable. As in life everything happened for a reason, and thats how nicely the story wrapped. After all, Misaeng is Incomplete Life and we are all incomplete lifes trying to become complete, Thats how Misaeng change my opinion about k-drama <3", "I've had my doubts when checking out the cast - it sure looked like an office romance to me, but man, I was wrong.This is not romance nor is it a mere office soap. It's about people working in an office and the moments they share with each other. You got each office type you'd meet in real life portrayed as realistitc as possible for a drama series. You get to know each person's flaws even and yet you never end up fully hating on anyone. Every person has a believable storyline, motives, motivations.On a sidenote, I'm an offive employee as well. Most of Misaeng is what my life is about - the work, the colleagues, the problems and epically funny moments, the bullying, the psychos, the coffee breaks... Wish I was as ambitious as Jang Gu-Rae, but mostly I enjoyed his naivety when facing problems and his loyalty towards Oh Sang-Shik and his colleagues. My favourite characters would be Oh Sang-Shik, Kang Hae-Joon and Han Seok-Yool. I remember my first job as an intern and that first boss. The only boss so far I've ever actually looked up to (well, before that I'd worked at schools which was a completely different experience anyhow). Oh Sang-Shik reminded me of my boss, the only boss I've ever met that was absolutely loyal and who everyone was loyal to because of that. I've learnt alot from him and will always be grateful. Manager Kang, oh well, not gonna lie, I have a weakness for people like that and I loved his taste in women - I think this is the manager I'd definitely learn the most from. \nWhile on the other hand, Seok-Yool, that one co-worker you really need in an office, who has more empathy than anyone else, yet sometimes seems like a dork. He's that good soul that'll keep the group together no matter what.I don't really want to go to work tomorrow, it's a heck load of work and people are sick these days, so it's more work for those who aren't on sick leave - but I feel motivated after finishing Misaeng.10/10 would recommend because Misaeng has that spark - that charisma that so many k-dramas are missing.", "This is a beautifully done simple story about an office, teamwork and relationships. After an episode or two, you are fully invested in the character Im Siwan plays and will be cheering him on. While there are no action scenes or fighting or even romance, it will grip your heart and at the end, you are disappointed it is finished.", "I am completely captured by the competence of the writers, director, actors and producers that created this series of highly thought provoking and insightful themes of everyday working culture. Thank you for making me think and review, the complex strategies revealed in the stories and in the acting portrayed.

If people wouldn't cast their votes based on their own experience while watching it (reading subtitles) this TV show would never had such a low grade as 7.5 which many of you may thing is quite good.This TV show deserves much, much more... if You are up to make an effort.

To be honest, after 4 episodes I googled the ending to know who the ultimate villain was. Still did not spoil the series for me. Characters here are all wonderful. My favourite mad dog here was Park Ong-Chul (played by Ma Dong-Seok). He was strong, relentless and injected humour. Storyline and overall cast gave a down to earth feel.

It's a pre-teen oriented Korean TV fairytale type romance drama that you'll probably have to be both very young and very female to enjoy...and, even then, you might not like it. It was supposed to be 16 episodes, but the viewing public said otherwise and it was called off after 10 episodes. Obviously, a show that can't fulfill its 16 episode time slot due to poor ratings is not going to be receiving a glowing review from me!SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: A pretty mermaid has a crush on a handsome human. She hastily drinks a magic potion to become human for a while in order to be with him. Unfortunately, she didn't realize she now has only 100 days to find her \"true love\" before she downed this concoction, lest she disappear from this world forever.This is another K-drama that was basically only airing on my TV for the viewing pleasure of my young nieces. It was rated for 15 years old, and that's basically the age range it caters to. It's not very well done though, due to its relentless predictability, lack of intelligence, and overall immaturity. Perhaps I'm just getting too old to even review a show such as this anymore, but with age comes wisdom, and I can easily recognize when a youthful show of this nature is basically just half-assing their way through a lazily written story solely for the sake of watching pretty young people try to find themselves, love, the meaning to their existence, and blah, blah, blah. This show is awash with walking hairdos and abs trying to figure out how to be men, and doe eyed cuties trying to figure out how to become a woman. I have nothing against the main cast, and I actually rather like several of them from their present and previous works. The problem here is all of these performers are too old to be acting as if they're still relationship stunted middle school students (which is frequently how they are portrayed).The immaturity factor cannot be overstated here; the male lead (who's playing a college aged grad or thereabouts, despite the fact that he's roughly 32 years old in real life) cries at least once in 6 different episodes (Yes, I counted). I have long since become accustomed to \"men\" crying in these K-dramas, but that is a 60% crying ratio per total episodes, and that is simply UNACCEPTABLE! There's also no shortage of scenes where he's generally just sulking or moping around as if he were a petulant child. The female lead/mermaid is assigned to play an aegyo factory that fluctuates primarily between elation and despair throughout the production. As expected, this leads to her basically being either super cute, or super annoying, with little room in between. Both characters are likable enough during the few instances where they're acting like \"normal/regular\" young adults but this (sadly) occurs far too infrequently. Much of the supporting cast suffers the same fate. i.e. there's lots of \"I'm so sad\", now \"I'm so confused\", now \"I'm so happy\" approach to storytelling here.This entire dichotomy of having the cast act like pre-pubescent teens one minute, then hot young adults the next, just doesn't work very well. This show would have been much better served to either employ a younger cast or be more thoughtfully written to allow the actors & actresses they've hired to be more diverse and well-rounded people, and a little more mature overall. Even the older actors & actresses on this show are often subjected to this immaturity, and it is painful to watch.The production values are good enough for a fantasy TV K-drama, but the writing just sucks. As an example of this; the dude the mermaid has a crush on suffers from prosopagnosia (which is a disorder where you can't recognize other people's faces), except, sometimes he apparently doesn't suffer from it at all. It's a bizarre and obscure character trait to include to begin with, but worse is the fact that it serves no real purpose to the overall story, and it's occasionally brought up then dropped again several times throughout the show. The lead mermaid character seems more concerned with clubbing, making friends, goofing off, getting a job, and so forth, as opposed to concentrating on NOT DYING within the 100 day limit she's allotted! Toss in some bad '80s American music and entertainment references, an early overuse of post-edit screen captions, cast members breaking out selca shots and song & dance routines out of nowhere, pointless brief cameos from K-Pop idols (as well as an industry wannabe who has no business being in front of the camera), and on and on it goes.This show is frequently disjointed. and yet it is incredibly predictable at the same time. There were many times where I questioned what the hell was going on, but there was never a doubt regarding who would ultimately be with whom, and what would basically occur to the entire cast of characters over the course of its run time.Summary: I try to be as objectionable and fair in regards to any review I write for these K-dramas (regardless of the audience they're aimed at), and I have seen numerous youthfully oriented shows which I've rather enjoyed. But this ain't one of 'em. It has a few worthwhile moments here and there, but not nearly enough of them. As such, I can't recommend this show to anyone (regardless of how old you are)!P.S. My 13-15 yr old nieces (and their similarly aged girl-friends) ultimately thought this show was just silly nonsense. And, if they thought it was immature (as did I), then your show got some problems!Bottom Line: A very generous 6 out of 10 stars, and I'd have a hard time defending even that high of a rating if pressed.", "I cannot even comprehend why they even bothered to making this very terrible drama.

This series is handled with a certain delicacy; a restraint that doesn't prevent or hold back, but depicts the tender beauty of two people in love. I submit that a viewer may find it very difficult to pass judgment, for how does one justify judging love? Can love be judged?To the naive viewer, Sunjae Lee is a young man, barely 20, who thinks and feels with his hormones. This is a gross misinterpretation and understanding of who he is. Sunjae Lee is a simple young man who knows how to do things in only one way: with love and passion. A gifted pianist, Sunjae is able to captivate his audiences, whether they be a concert hall or a few listeners, not with just the beauty of his play, but with the heart and passion he puts into it. Several viewers are so captivated by his play, that he moves them to tears. It is a bit ironic that a young man of 20 already knows the secret to love and living simply.Oh Hyewon is a middle-aged woman, approximately twenty years older than Sunjae. A renowned pianist when she was Sunjae's age, she has now found herself pulled into the world of wealth and power. She works for a Seohan Art Institute as an executive/accountant. She loves the life that her money buys for her, and she has long forgotten the passion and her own love for music. She is married to a university professor, who also works for the institute. They share a house and a life that is more like those of roommates than of spouses. There is little tenderness or warmth in their relationship or in their house, which looks like a cold bastille atop the street. It is somewhat ironic that the only room in the house that has any warmth at all, is the music room.Sunjae's talent is soon discovered, and he's asked to come over to the professor's house to play. Hyewon is asked to listen, given her musical background. Immediately, she is taken back to a time when she used to share the same love and passion for music that Sunjae has. Hyewon can't help but be enamored by the young man, unable to realize that she has already captivated him.There is a certain degree of irony in their relationship, in which Hyewon attempts to teach Sunjae about her world; the world of power and treachery. It is a world that is completely foreign to Sunjae, and he already realizes that he wants no part of it. He is not interested in money or acquiring things. And yet, it is his simple and complete way of loving, that makes him Hyewon's teacher in that regard. The acting performances are all first-rate, especially those of Ah-in Yoo (Sunjae) and Hui-ai Kim (Hyewon).

Ah-in Yoo is very good as the object of her fascination.", "I love this drama so much that I wrote my first review in IMDb. I found the show from Netflix. This is a story about how a young, poor, talented pianist (Lee Sun-jae) fell in love with his teacher (Oh Hye-won.) Oh Hye-won was a married woman, who entered the marriage out of calculation to advance her social status. In fact, her life was full of calculation until Lee Sun-jae entered her life. Lee Sun-Jae, a young man who was madly in love with Oh Hye-won, was not afraid of how their love was seen in other people's eyes. He just wanted Hye-won to love him back with honesty. I was really impressed by the production quality of the show. Yoo Ah-In (as Lee Sun-jae)'s acting was stunning. He depicted a shy yet fearless young man precisely. His acting was a package: not only through his words and eyes, but also his eye brows, his mouth, and all his body languages. Kissing scenes are common in drama, but passion from him was the most contagious. I have also watched other older drama by Yoo Ah-in. Secret Love Affair was the better one. Kim Hee-ae (Oh Hye-won) was an outstanding actress so the chemistry between the two was able to shine. When they were playing piano, you can feel the emotions between them. It is like music is where they could talk about their love loudly without any concerns of the world. The directing and music were so beautiful that I kept replaying the show after I have finished the show. I like how the show makes you wonder what is considered moral or not. Secret love affair is of course immoral in the eye of the society. But is a marriage based on interests really purer? However, I wasn't a big fan of the latter part of the story ,which was full of the obnoxious calculation and loud augments among those who were hungry for status and money. This part seemed to fall back to the typical format of Korean Drama....", "This is one of KDrama's best series with two fine actors in the leads.

It has the pull which made my smile intact all the way from first to the last episode and left me craving for one more serving. A cast you can't help but fall in love. A lead pair who are made for each other. All in all, just go for the fun ride. Its worth spending few hours to watch this beautiful creation. \nLee Jong Hyun and Gong Seung Yeon, I am going to follow you two all the way. Love.", "Our story begins telling the 'greatest love story' of Princess Pyeonggang and OnDal. We then cut to modern day, on a film set, creating a new take on the old love story. Soo-Jung is starring as the princess, however when something is changed in the script and she doesn't know about it, she throws a huge tantrum. And so we are introduced to our main character; a stubborn and easily provoked actress, known as Korea's 'top star'. Due to certain events she drives off in her car and is magically transported back to the past into the time of the Princess and OnDal, and must figure out how to return to the present whilst trying to deal with love and war.The best thing about My Only Love Song was definitely the characters. Soo-Jung, OnDal, Sam-Yong, and Il-Yong were all hilarious. A few of the characters I found annoying were the princess and the two guys who fawned over Il-Yong but overall the characters were great. The flashbacks in the final episode really showed how much the characters had changed over the course of the series, especially Soo-Jung, which was enjoyable to see. Soo-Jung (Seung-Yeon Kong) was the sassy main character, and although she's a terrible person, in the first few episodes at least, you just can't help but love her, especially when you start to peel away her tough exterior. Sam-Yong is the small innocent character that just needs to be protected and he' so cute. OnDal seems cocky and sure of himself, but he's actually very lonely and needs support. Il-Yong, the antagonist, is ridiculously in love with himself and a bit of a wimp but he's still twisted and sadistic.The plot I thought was fairly original, as I personally haven't seen any time-travel K- Dramas myself. A few plot twists occurred throughout the series, although not all of them made sense and were not really explained. The best by far though was near the end when we discover the truth about the OnDal in the story and everything clicks into place! It also keeps you guessing which character will end up with who, and there is plenty of laughs and tears to be had along the way. The scene with the flowers and 'apologising in advance' is by far the cutest and will rip your heart out with feels. Because I'm a nerd and did some research about the original story about the princess and OnDal afterwards and I love that they kept so many details the same, for example, OnDal was known as 'the idiot' or 'the fool', so the show subtly referenced this by having Soo-Jung call him 'dumb OnDai' lots, which I thought was cool.Other things: I was surprised by the special effects as they were very inconsistent. One minute they were really great and looked amazing and the next I was crying with laughter at how shockingly bad they were. The music was average, it didn't particularly stand out for me. I really like the whole design of both costumes and setting, I don't know how accurate they were but they were very aesthetically pleasing, especially the natural locations such as the huge river with the rocks.Overall, My Only Love Song is a fun and dramatic K-Drama, the only real downside being a few plot inconsistencies. If you're a K-Drama fan it's definitely worth watching but if you're new to K-Drama then you might find it a bit weird and want something a little more normal to ease you in to the genre.", "\u2764Spoiler Alert\u2764Aaah...time travel, one of my favourite genres :) One of the best on-screen chemistry I have seen, which makes the love story between On Dal and Su-Jeong (aka Nannyeon) so immersing. I also love that the writer matched everyone together, I always felt that these kinds made the best dramas. I was afraid that the ending would disappoint, much like Rooftop Prince. Thankfully, the love story was given justice with an equally beautiful ending and did not disappoint. I would love a Season 2, this time with a modern premise focusing Su-Jeong & On Dal in it :) and all my favourite characters - Su-Jeong + On Dal, Sam-Yong + Gwang-Nyeo, Moo-Myung + Pyeong-Gang \u2764", "This movie absolutely has no logic.

Ah, and the actor didn't hold it even a bit while ...., how should I put it in good words, showing his love towards the actress. So it has pretty steamy kissing scene!", "A short drama to watch, that is both funny and romantic, but there isn't much in the plot. The performances were okay, and probably that was the reason why this one didn't flop, as the story was odd and kind of idiotic at some point. But, at least, the drama was entertaining, it had it's funny moments and the romance was okay, as the couple had chemistry. The ending, in addition, as a bit of a wrap up and it wasn't as much of a conclusion to the story and that left out many unanswered questions.

The first episode was very well done; funny characters, good acting and directing, good music with little or no synths, and an interesting plot. We figured the rest of the series would be the same, but it got kind of repetitive after a while; the same music cues repeated endlessly, sometimes inappropriate for the scene, and almost always overly sentimental. They milked the Dickensian plot for twenty episodes, and it got kind of stupid after a while, but you get hooked because you want to find out who the killer was, who ordered him to kill the mother, etc... The humor (a lot of it unintentional) also kept us watching. It was aimed at a younger audience, so there was nothing in it that wouldn't fit into a G rating. In the end it was worth watching, but the same music cues used on all twenty episodes (maybe they were too cheap to hire a composer) drove me nuts."], "609": ["This drama is good so far because of Kim Jae Joong not because I like him as a singer strongly because his acting moves me his feeling of losing family felt so real yet dramatic at the same time with his real life.

Lee Bum Soo is usual awesome with his character but his character is not the central one here, Im Zi Wan is OK but not that great since I barely can feel sorry for him which I supposed I have to since watching the plot the audiences should feel sorry for him but I don't really feel that but after all he is not bad. Baek Jin Hee is plain her acting like \"I summon you gold\" is almost similar I cannot expect much from her, while others are so so.The plot is OK and a bit boring since it's mostly about gambling and company power struggle and half of the story I can feel that the plot is changed whereas there should be 3 main characters then it's only has one which is Kim Jae Joong's character but it's OK since his acting improves a lot after \"Dr. Jin and Protect the boss\", his sadness, his loneliness, his strong heart he gave his all this time and yes Kim Jae Joong should be the lead it's already the time if not because of those bias who said idols cannot acting. The ending is tragic yet happy one of the brother died you can guess who is it? The best soundtrack is sang by Kim Jae Joong, he conveys his feeling well into the lyrics as well since he wrote it himself. other ost are OK but unfortunately because Kim Jae Joong who was acting and singing at the same time for the drama ost so for other ost I cannot listen to it, well because Jae Joong is an amazing and talented singer.

As the series progressed I noticed that the series has a very good plot overall. It has all genres, suspense, romance, action and you could easily characterize it as a 'medical drama'. Lee Jong Suk has the main role, and he plays a prodigy doctor who was brought to North Korea when a politically strong individual tricked his father into going to North Korea to cure a politician during the war. During the time he and his father where held captives and where used for their medical knowledge and expertise, Lee Jong Suk's character gained excellent medical abilities which he later on uses.

Episode 2, didn't raise my hopes too much. There is a silly chase around a pillar, which I don;t think was meant to be funny. But as the show got on, it got better. It seemed to be a show that wanted to tick as many korean type dramas as possible from extreme violence to more light hearted fare, and in between. It was only as the show went, and no longer seemed to be going for extremes that it found it's footing, or perhaps I just got used to it. Acting wise. I thought Kang So-Ra was terrific, followed by Cheon Ho-Jin, who made a great villain. In I suppose what was the nominal female role, Jin Se-Yeon was fine. But she's probably not as good an actress as Kang So-Ra. In the lead role, Lee Jong-Suk, came across as being one of the better pretty boy actors out there. Although I really had to use my imagination to think of him as a doctor, especially when he had that HAIR. What I was a bit confused by, was who was the main female lead. Was it Kang So-Ra, or Jin Se-Yeon. to me it was Kang So-Ra, and the playful scenes between her and Lee Jong-Suk were some of the best in the series.

Just that the teens did a very good job; especially Nam Ji-hyun's depiction of the female lead. There were times when the story seemed to struggle with how to handle the two antagonists.

This series is handled with a certain delicacy; a restraint that doesn't prevent or hold back, but depicts the tender beauty of two people in love. I submit that a viewer may find it very difficult to pass judgment, for how does one justify judging love? Can love be judged?To the naive viewer, Sunjae Lee is a young man, barely 20, who thinks and feels with his hormones. This is a gross misinterpretation and understanding of who he is. Sunjae Lee is a simple young man who knows how to do things in only one way: with love and passion. A gifted pianist, Sunjae is able to captivate his audiences, whether they be a concert hall or a few listeners, not with just the beauty of his play, but with the heart and passion he puts into it. Several viewers are so captivated by his play, that he moves them to tears. It is a bit ironic that a young man of 20 already knows the secret to love and living simply.Oh Hyewon is a middle-aged woman, approximately twenty years older than Sunjae. A renowned pianist when she was Sunjae's age, she has now found herself pulled into the world of wealth and power. She works for a Seohan Art Institute as an executive/accountant. She loves the life that her money buys for her, and she has long forgotten the passion and her own love for music. She is married to a university professor, who also works for the institute. They share a house and a life that is more like those of roommates than of spouses. There is little tenderness or warmth in their relationship or in their house, which looks like a cold bastille atop the street. It is somewhat ironic that the only room in the house that has any warmth at all, is the music room.Sunjae's talent is soon discovered, and he's asked to come over to the professor's house to play. Hyewon is asked to listen, given her musical background. Immediately, she is taken back to a time when she used to share the same love and passion for music that Sunjae has. Hyewon can't help but be enamored by the young man, unable to realize that she has already captivated him.There is a certain degree of irony in their relationship, in which Hyewon attempts to teach Sunjae about her world; the world of power and treachery. It is a world that is completely foreign to Sunjae, and he already realizes that he wants no part of it. He is not interested in money or acquiring things. And yet, it is his simple and complete way of loving, that makes him Hyewon's teacher in that regard. The acting performances are all first-rate, especially those of Ah-in Yoo (Sunjae) and Hui-ai Kim (Hyewon).

It is primarily a mystery/thriller with a touch of a fantasy element.SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: A seemingly perfect husband & wife's young child is kidnapped and eventually found dead. The mother is distraught and tries to drown herself, but she fails. When she awakens from her unsuccessful suicide attempt, she finds she has traveled back in time 14 days prior to her daughter's death. Events from the previous 2 weeks start repeating themselves, and she soon realizes she better figure out what's going on in order to prevent the future death of her daughter from happening again.The initial premise of the show is set up quite well. It's not clear why this woman was sent back in time or why she's the only one who's aware of the events to come. It is apparently due to \"God's gift\", but this is never fully explained and there are very little religious overtones here. In fact, this time travel plot often gets lost in the scheme of things, except mostly at the beginning of the show, and at the very end; it does pop up occasionally, but this show spends a considerable amount of time focusing on its mystery and thriller elements instead. And surprisingly, there are very few romantic, comedic, or familiar melodramatic aspects to be found at all. It makes sense to not include these standard K-drama motifs in a show like this though; after all, what couple really has time for romance and fun with their costars when their daughter is about to be murdered?While I appreciate the effort to avoid typical K-drama themes for a change, the absence of these themes does create some problems when you have 16 hours to fill with nothing but one continuing mystery/thriller plot line. As such, this story is often unnecessarily byzantine during its run time; once this show hits its stride, there's a bevy of characters introduced who may or may not be the eventual kidnapper/killer, or who may be connected to the crime in some way. Each week it appears they might have finally caught the actual bad guy(s), only to find one more layer of the onion to peel back in next week's episode. The show is good at keeping you guessing who the culprit(s) is/are, but this rinse and repeat approach to storytelling does becomes tedious when you have to keep it going for much longer than is really practical.Aside from a few missteps, production values are satisfactory for a K-drama for the most part, though there are a few scenes (and one glaring one involving a car skidding out of control) where the editing and CGI departments didn't quite get the job done. There's only so much these departments can do on a TV show though that airs twice weekly.Writing is pretty solid, and the writers did pen an interesting & intricate story that they clearly worked very hard on. You'll have to pay attention in order to start connecting everything together down the stretch run, and this isn't always easy when you're a K-drama binge watcher like I am (who also likes to have a few drinks along the way). The story is not really complicated, but I often prefer my K-dramas to require as little attention as possible while viewing, and this is a show that really doesn't afford you that opportunity.Acting is mostly solid, but there are a few insufferably annoying characters on this show that will make you want to punch your TV. And as usual, you have to view everybody's performances here under the guise & understanding of how these K-dramas roles are typically portrayed. Lee Bo-young is fantastic throughout in the lead role of the desperate mom who'll do anything to save her daughter's life. Cho Seung-woo is solid as the main costar portraying a washed up cop trying to help Bo-young's character & her daughter while also trying to save his retarded brother on death row, heal past wounds, & reconnect with his family. There's various other important starring &/or supporting characters that are too numerous to mention in great detail (i.e. Bo-young's husband, the police squad leader, various potential bad guys, etc), but, I must give some credit to the 8-9 year old girl (Kim Yoo-bin) who plays the young daughter; she's tasked with portraying a number of traits and emotions of a typical girl of that age, while acting opposite adults. Her character is also forever getting kidnapped, threatened, and put in harm's way by a host of menacing bad guys; this would seem a bit scary to me if I were a little girl, but Yoo-bin just rolls with it all like a pro.And while there is no real humor to speak of, there is one thing (which recurs time and again) that I found particularly amusing; the husband and wife's baffling lapses in remembering that practically everyone in Korea is trying to kidnap & kill their little daughter. They both love and want to protect her, and often go to great lengths to save her, then they just let her wander off again, or leave her in the care of some incompetent weirdo or stranger or someone they know holds a grudge against them. I guess you need some means by which to keep the daughter in continual peril though.Summary: It's pretty good, but it has some faults and probably should've been pared down to the 12 episode range. I liked it overall, but I would have rated this at least a point lower than I did, if not for how it concluded. You'll have to sit & sift through A LOT in order to get the finish line, so the final payoff better be good when you eventually get there, and it is!Bottom Line: 7.5 to 8 out of 10 stars. Very Well Recommended (if you can overlook its flaws).", "if you follow Korean dramas you would know that they are pretty much afan girl service stuff and they rarely try anything outside the box when they do they usually flop and that's exactly the case in thisshow...a psychological thriller that with some improvements in the script could be a good movieLee Bo young who is probably the most underrated Korean actress gives her all as a grieving paranoid mother who will do anything and everything for her child and her performance is so realistic and heartbreaking ... the male lead is also solid as the shady detective who keeps you guessing all the way ...the acting and the interesting idea and solid production makes you forgive the obvious holes in the script and the way the writer treated the characters the ending upset about 95% of the fans but viewed objectively its a logical ending but should been done more proficiently but again thats what happens when you have to shoot the drama live. 10 for acting and ambition"], "630": ["Sly and Single Again aka Cunning Single Lady is a16 episode KTV drama from early 2014.SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: Young couple gets married and sets out on their perfect family life to come. Not so fast though! Husband abruptly quits his bread winning job to try to start his own business, wife tries to support him while running the household & paying the bills, tensions rise as they fall deeper in debt with no hope in sight, etc. Eventually, wife gets fed up with what little husband is offering to the marriage, so she divorces him.A decade later, ex-husband has since become hugely successful with his business startup, and this makes ex-wife more than a little resentful. She sets out to get even and make his life miserable while planning to make him regret that he \"let her get away\". In order to accomplish her task, she takes a job as an intern at his company in order to get close to him and set her plan in motion. What she fails to realize though is that he's still bitter that she didn't stick by him years ago, and he's equally determined to now make her jealous of his new found fame & success.The premise here is fairly modest and easy to follow. Two former spouses each still have some feelings, both good and bad, for the other. Now that they're older (and sometimes wiser), you observe their push and pull relationship unfold in typical K-drama fashion; first they try to get back at each other for past slights, then they get over it and start to move on, then they grow to understand each other better and consider starting over together if it's meant to be. It couldn't be any more simplistic or orderly, and as a result, the first part of the show is mostly comedy drama, second part is mainly regular drama, and final part is primarily melodrama with some romance and maybe love along the way.Lee Min Jung & Joo Sang Wook play the two lead characters. Both performers are in their prime and they have no problems handling their respective roles. Joo Sang Wook is a highly amusing just to look at when he's portraying his younger self, complete with atrocious hair style. He's pretty effective throughout as his modern day eligible bachelor self, who's still a bit dorky and unsure of his feelings underneath. Lee Min Jung has primarily been taking on a number of these similarly themed K-drama female roles in the last several years, and she is quite good at this stuff; she has a nice comedic touch to go along with all the other attributes expected of a lead actress in this type of role.Potentially standing in the way of our estranged couple at every turn is the 3 stereotypical chaebol family members that comprise this story's antagonists & other potential love interests; they include the self-serving family patriarch with typical ego & pride, the carefree handsome young son who likes the female lead, and the wounded older daughter who likes the male lead. They are all pretty standard characters for a K-drama; the Dad is somewhat emotionally distant and primarily obsessed with his own legacy, the son is perpetually stuck at the age of a boy trying to become a man, and the daughter can't get over a tragedy that happened to her in the past. Each of these family members is intended to be a sympathetic figure to some degree while simultaneously irking the viewer on numerous occasions.The first couple episodes focus on the leads as their younger selves, and are used mostly for background and setup purposes. Then, the two leads get re-acquainted with one another again in the present where the rest of the series takes place. Things are kept pretty lighthearted and are rolling along pretty well for a while until the tone of the series begins to shift, and it's all mostly melodrama from there on in. The tonal shift was not unexpected, but it just reeks of too much familiarity that suggests it's coasting down the standard K-drama checklist of scenes to accomplish in order to wrap up and move on to another show, and that is my primary problem with this show.I love the Hallyu entertainment industry in most all its forms, but I'm often baffled by how reluctant they seem to be to take a chance on something new, particularly when they would clearly be so good at it. This is especially true when it comes to Korean TV shows, as you basically have variety/reality programming and stuff like this show, and very little else. I know these shows are under enormous pressure to simply churn out copy, hit a certain ratings number, and \"cover all the bases\" as best as possible...but, I can't help but think this show would have been fantastic as primarily a romantic-comedy from start to finish, and, I know I'm not the only one who thinks this. There must surely be a market for KTV viewers who could do without another cookie cutter melodrama that insists on falling back on typical characters and clich\u00e9s in order to tell a story. And, if given a chance, I'm sure the writers of this show could have figured out a way to include an appropriate amount of love, loss, & melodrama without invoking the same tired and silly antagonist & love interest angles.Summary: I don't mean to come across as being too harsh on this particular show, It's not that bad at all, and I will recommend it. But, it is one of those K-dramas that makes me long for the day when the heavens align to allow for each particular KTV show to just do what it does best, and leave the \"formulaic/one size fits all/status quo\" method of storytelling behind.Bottom Line: 7 out of 10 stars on the K-drama scale.", "The synopsis of this one is misleading making it seem like a revenge tale.Instead it's a story about a couple that really cared for each other but went through hard times that forced them apart then meet again three years later. The husband is rich and successful, the wife is bitter that he found all this success while sticking her with his debt when he left.At first the wife is viewed as irrational and bitter while the husband acts like he's moved on. It took up until mid season for them to make the wife more sympathetic which is weird in this kind of drama.The ending is a bit rushed. it would have benefited from stretching it out over a few episodes rather than the confused tying of loose ends that happened but over all it's a sweet, romantic tale with a couple that really acted like they've been married for years.", "Just finished watching this show and I would recommend it. I was a bit hesitant after reading the reviews as I got some mixed feelings about it. But I would recommend it as it's: funny, entertaining maybe a bit unrealistic, but nonetheless worth watching.There are a lot of really funny one-liners in the show as well as some really good discussion scenes. It's about a failed marriage so you can imagine that each side blames the other. It is worth the watch, it makes you laugh and tugs at your emotions and makes you wonder how could one person get in so much trouble.Spoiler Alert: The show starts really well, each episode builds for the next but it does fall apart in the final episode. Sure you expect them to get back together again, but it was too easy a re-connection.First they tried to make it as a Steve Jobs scenario, he loses job and then creates another company (Jobs created Pixar) and then the company merges. But they ran through this concept very quickly and without much detail as to what's happening.Next the re-connection with all the individuals (plots, sub-plots) was so distant. What I mean it was, every one go to your neutral corners, no interaction between the players in the final episode. No connection between the different stories in the final scene. Every story (scenario) ends by itself not related to any of the others in the show. By bringing all the stories together it would have made for a bigger happy ending.", "The story is quite atypical. Divorce and remarried. The male lead is not handsome, but acting is ok. No complaint on female lead. The plot is sophisticsted and well made. A movie worth a watch.", "Cunning Single Lady sounds like a revenge drama, about a dynamic famme fatal who is ready to take down everyone who stands in her way etc etc. However, it is actually about a woman who is too sweet and too good and too much of a victem.\nMinus:\n-The story got annoying at some point\nPossitives:\n-Good acting\n-even though it's not what the title suggests, it is actually a decent drama\n-has some cute aspects\nSo, 6.5 out of 10."], "631": ["Her lovely heels is a short drama about a girl who fells in love with her colleague, after meeting him at a shoe store. They start going out secretly, but then her ex boyfriend shows up. The romance was nice enough, with the slow development and the weak love triangle. The couple, although they looked pretty good together (both very good looking) they didn't share the same amount of chemistry. Nevertheless, the ups and downs of the relationship were entertaining enough. Plus, each episode was about ten minutes long, so it didn't get boring or tiring. The soundtrack was okay, and the supporting roles did a great job to keep the interest high. Finally, the constant presentation of the shoes, though at first, it was cute, it got tiring in the end. So, my rating for this drama is 5 out of 10."], "632": ["Well, reading all these interesting comments above made me think.... First of all,i have to say that i loved Wonderful Days. A lot. The art is gorgeous, yes, i think this is the one point everyone can agree upon, hands down. Now, concerning the storyline itself....I think there should be some clarification, especially for all those poor ppl who must have watched this in English (either subtitled or dubbed). Those who did the translations deserves to get hanged. and i mean it. i own the special edition 3-disc original Korean DVDs and have also watched both the subtitled and dubbed versions. It actually feels like i'm watching 2 completely different versions of the story! The original korean version has a much more interesting (not the greatest, but definitely superior and full of nuances)script and explains the story quite well, unlike the English versions that either skip entire parts of dialogues (which are essential to understand the movie *_*) or change their meanings into something totally different and just plain wrong! And someone mentioned that some characters' names weren't mentioned in the movie till the very end. Well, i can tell you that the names (except that evil adjudant(?)) are mentioned quite early in the beginnings, but mysteriously, NOT in the English versions O_o ! I'm on the verge of thinking that it must be some sort of conspiracy to ruin this otherwise great movie... I suggest you watch the korean version....or get a korean friend to actually translate you the real lines, instead of getting confused at the horrible English sub/dub. anyway. oh, and i honestly don't understand all those who say that the story wasn't original,good enough,etc etc. i mean, it might not be the most mind-boggling thing on earth, but the twists are original enough to set it wiiiide-apart from your average anime/movies where all you have is 90 minutes of explosions, punches, boobies, and some supposedly dramatic ending (that ppl apparently find \"original\"). For those of you who still think the story isn't well explained in the movie...well, there's always the novelized version that came out in Korea (no English versions, sorry) that gives all the background story between the characters and all. Like what really happened in Shua & co.'s childhood, the characters' motives, blah blah...Boy, is this review getting longer and longer....A final word... considering the depressing situation in Korea (let's just say that animation/comics are ignored by most and the market terribly limited) the creators and all those who worked on this film did an unbelievable job. I really hope things get better back there, cuz it's not the skills they lack, but public support and funding. oh, i guess i have to rate this thing. 10/10 for the story (9/10 for the actual flow), 10/10 for the art, 15/10 for the efforts lol.", "Great great movie...tech-wise. Ok, granted it's not the most elaborate or original of movie plots. It's the eternal story about love and jealousy, power and corruption, good and evil but it has got a Miyazaki twist to its story, or at least tries to emulate the master, rather unsuccessfully I might add. The animation is like nothing I have seen before though, and I HAVE seen Final Fantasy. Main problem: the characters are poorly developed, if not at all. And the story doesn't grab you by the collar and throw you in its world, so you're always \"aware\" of the animation, it being the masterpiece that it is... But again, it's a movie well worth seeing, some shots will even make your jaw drop and eyes bulge, that's how much the scenes are beautifully drawn and animated. The authenticity of the \"small\" things (rain dropping pattern, eyes watering) is what I personally marvelled at more than anything else. Oh, and an out-of-this-world soundtrack to top it off, with some exquisite pieces that matched the moods perfectly. It was the only thing that really \"sucked me in\" a few times... All in all, it is a very promising start to all-korean animations.", "This is definitely more than a pure animation. It's more like a movie, only an animated one. My emphasize here is on the word movie. Not because it has a brilliant colorful animation, that sometimes appears to be 3 dimensional, and sometimes 2 dimensional ( which is spectacular by itself). It has that. But I'm thinking of it as a movie because of high details. Actually, this is direction. When I watch animation, I don't really care who's the director of it. In fact, Until this one I forgot there is one in each animation like in every film. This movie is full of details that make it look much better than other animation. I'll mention some of them, that I found the most interesting.1. Near the beginning of the movie, there is a scene with a tunnel exit covered by a waterfall, that flows not quite as one could expect of it. You get an explanation of the irrational flow a couple minutes after, but isn't it amazing they thought about it? 2. Flies around a lamp. When was the last time you saw flies around a lamp (in animation), just as part of the view, because they attracted to light and not to portray something ( like trash site, bad smell, dirt or other metaphoric things that flies represent). 3. While Jay was entering the rebel zone a guard watched him through the optics of a sniper rifle. They could show us only the guard, without the mentioned aspect. But no, this is what a direction is about!!! 4. Jay's fight with the army's commander. Just watch the details.I could possibly continue with some more examples,like shooting scenes from different angles and so, though those were the most vivid to me. Think about it. Think about they thought about it. In one word the animation was excellent. In some words it was a tasteful mixture, with live colorful characters and places. I don't really think they could do it better. Both the 3 dimensional animation and the 2 dimensional looked awesome. I really don't agree with those who say that the latter was dull and poorly done. As I said, I don't think it could be done better.Another aspect of this movie, that stroked me with it's uniqueness, at least from western animation, is the brutality and the naturalism. I don't know much animation (again western), where a gun was violently put against somebody's head, shooting it, and spilling the blood all around. I don't think this kind of violence is good or bad, but in a way it completes the movie. I just get the feeling that it's necessary. This also brings it closer to movies because there is some convention (unspoken) that animation is for younger audience.Well, the movie is not all good. Like every other movie, the plot is a crucial thing. Wonderful Day clearly lacks one. It tries to be scientifically ingenious in it's main idea which makes no sense if one thinks about it (you don't really have to think, its obvious enough). There is another thing that bothers. This movie involves a drama among three characters, which at the end gets exaggerated and too emotional ( emotional not for the viewer but for the characters themselves). There are a lot of animated and non-animated movies with that kind of drama in them. Some of them pass this drama to the audience, while others try but fail. Wonderful Days belongs to the latter. It has a good revealing of the drama at the beginning and the middle of the movie, but in the end it disappoints.Wonderful Days' flaws are minor compared to its highlights. I would recommend it to anyone who likes animation and is not disturbed with excessive violence. My rating: 7.5/10", "This has become one of my absolute favourite films.I rented the German dubbed version, which is quite nicely done, apart from some sentences that seem to short for genuine German conversation (our phrases are usually 20% longer than, say, English phrases ... something seemed to be missing in the dub).The story is nice and a little mysterious, but it is very important to realize that the film tells quite a bit of it with images alone - no dialogue, no narration. Just these absolutely stunning images.I almost screamed in joy in the scene early in the flick where Shua and Jay sit, handcuffed together, him holding a gun to her face, in front of a beautiful Christian church glass artwork in this museum (\"time capsule room\"), and just the image tells the audience so much (and yet so delightfully little at the same time!), making this a scene without any dialogue was the best the film makers could have done.There is so much imagery. They really figured out how to blend excellent Gothic and oriental architecture with the industrial cyberpunk setting of the slums around the city Ecoban, and they made not only every second of it count, no, they give you gratuitous flights and motorcycle drives through the wonderful, desolate landscape that you sometimes wish would never end.All in all, a film with a definite 10/10 visuals, a 9/10 story, German dub quality 8/10, a soundtrack that's easily a 10/10, and subtle but decent sound effects, 7/10.The best movie, in my opinion, that I have seen this year.", "Despite never hearing of the film prior to watching it, the opening sequence alone had me hooked. Great visual design, and vehicle animation complemented nicely by a soundtrack that has just the right mix of classical, neo rock, and new age allows this film to surpass similar Animated/Computer Generated feature films. While the story isn't the most innovative amongst Science Fiction anime, it has its high points particularly in the beginning and conclusion. The director shifts perspectives from action scenes towards slower paced dramatic scenes before returning to the action for an excellent tempo. The use of flashback also helps to fill in the backgrounds of the characters. The use of methodically paced travel sequences coupled with superb music would really have to be experienced on the big screen preferably with Digital Light Processing(DLP) to fully appreciate its beauty.Fans of the Animatrix, Titan A.E., and Princess Mononoke would probably enjoy this, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to a broader audience because of its superb audio visual design, and landscape sequences. Worth Owning on Video for its high quality. Would be nice to see this given a professional transfer to DVD with known Actors much the way Armitage 2 and Princess Mononoke was given in Europe and North America.", "I was completely hooked from the opening sequence, which is breathtaking. I'm not sure if I've scene a better combination of traditional 2D animation, and 3D animation in an animated film.  It's simply stunning (My jaw literally dropped during of some the scenes).  This movie is worth seeing just for the visuals alone.  The story is by no means amazing, but it was good enough to keep me interested.  It definitely could have been better, but it didn't stop from really enjoying this film.  I should point out that I viewed the original Korean language English subtitled \"Wonderful Days\", and not the English Dubbed \"Sky Blue\".8 out of 10.  Korean animation has a bright future.", "WONDERFUL DAYS (2003) Directed by Kim Mun-saeng, this is a stunningly designed and rendered flat animation/CG/model hybrid that only wants for a better story. Despite it's box office failure (still the most successful Korean animated film to date I heard), it's bodes well for future endeavours in the genre. At it's core, its about the `haves' in an environmentally-polluted future world plotting to wipe out the `have-nots' so they can replenish the dwindling energy supplies to their self-contained megacity. Fortunately, the have-nots have a brooding outcast on their side who knows how to put things right. The 2-disc Korean DVD is packed with extras, as is an expanded 3-disc Korean DVD. The films does, I might add, improve greatly on repeat viewings. I give it an 8, largely for artistic merit.", "i was waiting a long time for this masterpiece. now that i've finaly watched it i can only confirm my assumption (the trailer was more then beautiful). the plot could be a bit better. luckily the animation and sound (music) make up for that. I can't realy remember a movie that has used such a unique technique. a must see for sure.", "I don't know why, but there's this overwhelming part of the people who've seen(not seen?) this movie that just takes it for granted that it's just nice cg Effects and no story? Yes, the story can be fuzzy sometimes, but the only thing that bothers me is the near-ending scenes (wich is the great draw-back of the movie) that I can't really figure out what's happening. And that's it.But anyway, this movie is the most beautiful I've ever seen, and the story ain't to be complained about! The characters are for the most time interesting, but maybe not fully reflectively.I'd say that you need to see it more then one time and think a bit about what you've seen, not only to see the surface of it. It's way deeper then most of you would ever know. Well..Love it or not!", "I was very privileged to see the world premiere of this at the Waterloo Film for Animated Cinema this weekend.  The animation is absolutely amazing. They blended CGI with live animation, matte paintings, and video of miniatures, and accomplished what I say is easily the most amazing animation I have ever seen.  In addition to this they managed to have a story that rivals the best of Japanese anime.  This film proves that Korea is ready to start producing their own animation rather than just animate for other countries.  Do yourself a favor and see this whenever you get the chance.", "A few words of encouragement.Wonderful Days probably has some of the best animation in the world, and can rival films like Ghost in the shell, Akira and Princess Mononoke. But the story was poorly written and severely underdeveloped.I hope to see more from Tin House, and Wonderful Days should not set them back. Hopefully they will learn from this mistake and create classic animation that can rival the likes of Production I.G. or Studio Ghibli.\nIf Moon - Saeng Kim is reading this, get out there and show us what you're really made of, we know you can do much better. Also hire a team of world class scriptwriters for a change.6.5 / 10", "\"Wonderful Days\" strives for so much, it's almost a tragedy that it actually achieves so little.  The problem with the film isn't that the plot is thin, nor is it that we've seen these ideas before.  The term \"variations on a theme\" exists for a reason.Rather, the problem lies with the poorly conceived story and characters that get left out in the cold with horrible dialogue and about as much depth as a kiddie pool.The opening, for instance, tells us of a gigantic, man-made refuge known as ECOBAN, which is owned and operated by the ruling class.  ECOBAN runs on pollution, which of course means that ruling class prey on the beleaguered proletariats to create more pollution to sustain ECOBAN.  We are, of course, never told -how- ECOBAN manages to transform pollution into a power source, nor are we told why anyone smart enough to build something like ECOBAN would want to create something that necessitates -more- pollution.  I presume it is to keep the upper class fed, but seeing as they already had the resources to build something like ECOBAN in the first place....But I digress.  The point is that ECOBAN exists as nothing more than a plot contrivance to set up some admittedly fantastic visual sequences later on. But you wouldn't know that from the way the movie treats it.  Given the background, I would gather that ECOBAN was meant to be a symbol of the upper class' greed and arrogance.  That's all well and good, but the very idea of ECOBAN is so implausible and the story thread so inadequate that it quickly becomes nothing more than a neat-looking playground.This is not the film's only shortcoming.  The characters are woefully underdeveloped and uninteresting, so much so that right after I watched the film, I could barely remember their names.  When they're not fighting, leaping, driving, or shooting, they're spending most of their time occupying the frame, doing and saying things of absolutely no consequence.  New friendships and alliances pop up literally out of nowhere, and some characters disappear and reappear as if the writers had forgotten about them and then remembered just 15 minutes before deadline.It goes without saying that the animation is great.  In general, the CG meshes with the 2D animation quite well, and the action sequences are frenetic and imaginative.  While the filmmakers might be brilliant action choreographers, however, they are not writers.  Not here, anyway.", "Looking in many ways like the film the Final Fantasy hoped to be Wonderful Days tells the story of several people in a world underwater and where pollution is the only form of fuel. Its an odd mix of 3D CGI, Models and 2D animation that sets up a world that could be ours several decades from now. The title is ironic, there is little joy and happiness for anyone and the Wonderful Days of the title refers to a shared childhood memory of two friends actually seeing a cloudless blue sky. The plot, concerning an attempt to bring back that blue sky and return freedom to the world has been done before. Whats interesting here is the animation which mixes the various elements into a cohesive whole. The long motorbike ride that opens the film would be stunning on a large screen, had I been lucky enough to see it projected that way. There are numerous references to other films and animated series, (the  battle of Spike and Vicious in the church in episode 5 of Cowboy Bebop  springs to mind)are nicely placed and not to distracting. The film suffers in the final third as things become less clear until the final tragic battle has a few too many \"how did he get here\" moments. The ending, as unhappy as the title would make you hope is nicely in keeping with the whole feel of the film. Unfortunately the ending is probably whats going to keep this film difficult to see outside of imports and festival screenings. If you like animation, science fiction or off beat films, see this film, you will not be disappointed.", "As far as the plot goes, it's nothing that hasn't been done before, but for what it is it's well told.  The animation on the other hand is stellar, and rivals anything the Japanese studios have done, and the musical score quite nice as well.  I'd recommend this movie for the eye-candy alone, but the plot isn't as bad as some of the previous reviews have made it out to be, just don't go in with inflated expectations and you should find it a satisfying experience.", "Sky Blue or Wonderful Days? It's obvious the former is the superior title for this film as it actually has relevance to the plot and the revelations within. Regardless, Sky Blue (or Wonderful Days) is an extremely engaging Korean (dare I say it without having negative responses plastered over my review?) 'anime' which is just absolutely ridiculous in its ability to leave you awe-struck with the beauty it possesses. Created over a seven year period Sky Blue fuses together computerised technology with a hand drawn elements to create something which can be said to be unique, then you have to wonder what they were doing over this seven year period in terms of scripting. That is certainly not unique.There is much to love with Sky Blue on your first viewing, as I will testify to. It is engaging beyond belief on premiere, the story rings true, you identify with characters you become emotionally attached. The action sequences are sumptuous and I cannot describe the animation enough because it is simply gorgeous, incredibly detailed with a feel to it which is so fresh, new and vibrant it knocks the stuffing out of \"comedic\" ogres and talking fish. However, hindsight being that wonderful tool it is the realisation occurs in the aftermath of this film, rising through the cloud to shine bright into your mind, that the plot is no better than that of talking fish and kittens in shoes because it is so mind bogglingly generic. We've seen it all before, and yes there is a school of thought which says that being generic does not mean it is never going to be spectacular, I can agree with that, but you cannot base a premise of giving this film ten out of ten purely on the animation, the story must accompany it and unfortunately it falls slightly flat. There is nothing offencive or intrusive about the plot, as I stated it is engaging, but there have been far too many films in which we have seen these sequences played out with the same results time after time after time.Empire claims this to be \"Akira For The 21st Century\", I'm sorry but no. For one there is a notable lack of philosophy for that claim to even be levelled at this film. Yes characters have views, opinions and mantras which they go through, but the \"philosophy\" is far too one- dimensional, working on one premise alone, for that claim to even contain any grounding in reality, let alone virtual. However, having said that, this film manages to achieve what the Wachowskis could not in their third instalment, a means to conclude a story with dignity. Yes we have seen Sky Blues plot line before, yes it is generic, but somehow you end up liking this film regardless, it has too many plus points, too many saving graces. Our three protagonists love triangle is (insert the word of the day here) but is still emotive enough to draw you in, and the subsidiary characters provide little quirks with enough sparks of life and freshness to allow you to settle in and feel at ease with the film.When using the tools of hindsight and criticism combined you realise that this film, for all its faults, is hugely entertaining and at the end of the day, that's what they've set out to achieve. The director has created a film which is fun, exciting, action-packed, thoughtful and above all just incredibly beautiful, and even an average plot can be pulled up from the wasteland when fused together with originality on other levels. Sky Blue is a revelation in animation and in its own way is an Akira for the 21st Century. Where Akira broke Japanese animation into a Westernised world, Moon Sang Kim and these creators from Korea have pushed forward their own brand of animation saying to Hollywood \"anything you can do, we can improvise on better\", and that alone deserves plaudits. Expect to be dazzled and prepare to enoy but be ready to come out expecting a whole lot more.", "To me, Wonderful Days is more like a feature film than anime; I guess because the scenery often looks so real. I had the opposite experience of some. I was expecting a good quality SF anime. Problem is I really don't like SF anime, because of the formulaic plots, emphasis on action, juvenile dialog, and 2-dimensional characters. So I was expecting to be very disappointed. I put off watching the DVD for two weeks. I like Science Fiction films very much, but those are almost extinct in Hollywood. I like Blade Runner, William Gibson stories (Johnny Mnemonic and Neuromancer which never got released), and thought Star Wars was just OK-but at least was very entertaining. I was nearly floored by how much I liked this film. What makes Wonderful Days so good is the great screenplay, directing, and yes acting. But the real topper is the realism of the artwork- mainly the scenery. There are a lot of metallic objects and walls, etc. Only the people seem more hand drawn, but that is OK, because with all the surroundings, the cartoon aspect of the humans kind of gets forgotten, because the story is so absorbing (to me). Kind of like in a surreal dream, but one that seems so identical to real life that you can feel your own skin. Simply put- this is a good science fiction thriller with some action-but not all action. Some of this reminded me of Blade Runner, other things were reminiscent of Star Wars. Another aspect of Wonderful Days that enhances further is the Miyazaki factor. Wonderful Days has a similar environmentalist message as some films like Nausicaa of Valley of the Wind, and Princess Mononoke. I think the success of this film also lies partly in the simple, but suspenseful story, and with some good character development, such as Blade Runner had.", "\"Wonderful Day\" is mostly an exercise of style over substance: The plot has some interesting elements and a great atmosphere of melancholy...But sadly most of the story feels flat and forgettable (Despite some memorable and beautifully animated sequences) Kind of like \"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within\", except that this movie is a bit less boring and it have better characters.The animation and the designs were pretty good (Despite some brief moments where the expressions in the faces of the characters turn a bit awkward) but overall, the combinations of traditional animation, CGI and miniatures have an incredible looking appearance. The sceneries are beautiful and the movements of the characters are pretty fluid and well done.If only the plot were as good as the animation...Well I guess it could have been a much worse...This could have been something preachy or emotionless (Like \"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within\") Despite the boring and melodramatic parts of the story, \"Wonderful Days\" it's something worth watching, at least for the excellent quality of the animation.", "Absolutely astonishing! Not only the magnificent scenes, but more of the integrity of the story line, the moral behind it, the CGI, and the romanticism (not to be mixed-up with man-woman relationship/love, I meant the classic definition of romanticism - sublime)!Having read many mangas, seen countless anime as well as feature length films, I think this is, to an extent, the only one of its kind! Relating 'Sky Blue' to several analogous feature films, the former sees through the modernity and the implication of so-called civilization reflected from 'Ghost in the Shell' 1995, 'Innocence' 2004 and 'Appleseed'; the devastating consequence of being selfish, greedy and blind as typified in the classic 'Akira', 'Jin-Roh' and 'Final Fantasy Advent Children'; and the beautiful perception of human nature as seen in 'Castle in the Sky', 'Spirited Away', even in 'Monsters Inc.', and built an unforgettable masterpiece! Yet the combination is nothing ever dramatically, explicitly, realistically and beautifully expressed before!Recalling those CGI wastelands, to me there are something inside of them, not a single phrase to describe them! \u0096 Magnificent yet regretful, seemingly hopeless yet nostalgic!", "This must be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen ! First of all - the mood is great - this whole movie is a dark cyberpunk-Gothic drama, but yet there is hope that the darkness will come to an end. The second great thing is the animation technique - a mix of computer generated effects (which are truly outstanding) and hand drawn animations. The machines and buildings look very real, there is a lot of 3d action scenes, but hand-drawn characters leave no doubt that this one is a classic anime.The stunning visuals are accompanied by a great soundtrack.The story itself is rather predictable - it involves love, rebellion, an treason - and it fits great. I'don't want to spoil the fun, so I won't reveal more.", "Wonderful Days, is a flawed masterpiece. In it's about 90 minutes running time, it's incredible larger-than-life ambitious story takes place in a galore of beautiful images and sound.Images and sound. This is what Wonderful Days is about. It's a living proof of animation being art. Everything from the supreme art direction to the very detailed CGI to the hauntingly and tear jacking soundtrack. The story is were it's flawed. It's like, Wonderful Days tries to tell tons of stories. It is simply not enough for the time, the movie lasts. That's not to say that it's bad. The love story between the two main characters, the story about human civilization being at it's end and about the sufferings of the lower classes, is something we have seen hundreds of times before in Animation and Anime.Wonderful Days does not have the philosophy and soul searching elements of Ghost in the Shell, nor is it as hip or as revolutionary as Akira, but it TRULY does stand on it's own legs. It depends on how you look at it. YOU as a viewer have to decide, if you want to let the images and music tell the story, or try to compare it to the top Japanese movies. It's masterpiece in it's own right. It just depend on which way you look at it. It's full of action, interesting characters and again... Some of the most beautiful CGI and animation ever. I personally consider this MUCH better than some similar movies like Appleseed, GITS1 and 2 and FF7: Advent Children. Wonderful days is a large step in the right direction for Korean animation. Go see this movie. Appreciate it for what it is.9/10", "I saw this animated movie in June 2004, and again i will say that i am no newcomer to animes, i have seen lots and lots of these. So far I've only bumped on all the good ones and that is good. Well anyway, Wonderful days, has a story somewhat similar to George Orwell's 1984 book. It is in a way very similar especially with the idea of a sun blocked by the clouds, or confined life behind buildings and lies. The higher class and lower one are also portrayed here. I think i am getting used to big finales now, but in wonderful days, the finale was excellent, spanning through 5 minutes approximately, with blood splashing out, and characters flying in all directions. Amidst the violence, there are deep emotions, love, and sadness. It is not just about survival, but acts of heroism too, to save Gibraltar. Animations are excellent, blend very well together, and the story is excellent for my money too, going to get the DVD, hope it's available. 10/10 and nothing else really.", "I imported \"Sky Blue\" on Blu-Ray disc and payed quite a big sum of money, just going by the reviews on IMDb. Usually I blindly trust these user reviews and the rating... In this case though I was a bit disappointed. As a long time anime fan this film has its moments but overall doesn't impress. The CGI seemed outdated and the hand drawn animation fell short of most anime feature films I know. The story would be fitting for a 20 minute episode of some anime series, but certainly not for a feature film. It just doesn't grab you or makes you care about any of the characters. There is some action to be seen but even this doesn't seem to \"work\" because I just didn't care much for the characters. The claim that this film was seven years in the making is certainly not justified by it's quality. But more likely by a hampering cash flow.Perhaps because of the medium (Blu-Ray) some shortcomings were also clearly visible . There is a lot of \"color banding\" and even some pixelation of objects that were clearly not intended for the HD medium. I honestly cannot recommend this film... well, maybe as a rental.", "The animation of this animation was really superb. But then again, I've always had a weak spot for huge post-apocalyptic structures.\nBut the story... it's so boring. I think it's because the story fails to capture the audience. You don't care for the good guys, and you don't care if the bad guys die or not. You just look at the pretty pictures, but even those become boring after 30 minutes.Rating: 4/10.", "Sky Blue is another formulaic futuristic sci-fi animated feature with an apocalyptic vision of mankind's fate in much the same mould as Square's cinematic bomb Final Fantasy:The Spirits Within. Like that worthless movie, Sky Blue serves up an ambitious central plot set in the distant future (2142?) after a global disaster, in this case a man-made disaster, and then proceeds to clumsily fumble with some important themes such as friendship, love, dreams and the environment through a poorly written story with a weak cast instead of developing the environmental message into a cohesive and engaging yarn like one would expect. Earth is in peril due to humans causing an ecological catastrophe that has blacked out the sky. The set up is familiar, borrowing the same formula as FF:SW. We have the last remnants of our species gathered in a giant, covered city with the entire planet now one big wasteland, a troubled 'hero' who drifts into strange dream sequences and battles against time to save mankind (in this case by destroying the city to let the sun shine through the clouds!?!) and a squad of 'lovable'(annoying and stupid more like) warriors fighting for the cause. There is even the crude tacked on 'romance' that is both completely unnecessary in such a film and undeveloped, but it seems filmmakers these days feel obliged to have a tacked on love story at the core of every non romantic film so I can almost forgive the scrip writers for this crime. Unfotunately there are no weird aliens in this film and the characters are amongst the weakest ever created - the hero, the girl (who's only discernible trait is having red hair) and the (oh so sci-fi animation clich\u00e9) villain are all devoid of personality and the script they deliver is weak, cold, corny and unrealistic - every line seems to be an explanation of the plot (which is so thin it requires little explanation) instead of any meaningful insight into what is going on between the characters. Another film from the orient that attempts Hollywood style story telling (for some reason) and fails miserably.Sky Blue was a very poor film indeed, however it will look great on a HD Widescreen display, if only for the backgrounds. A lot of time and money was invested in this project however there are some very noticeable problems with the animation (the only thing notable in the production). Shadowing is poorly done creating disappointing effects on bikes and the flying bike things, most moving objects don't look properly integrated with backgrounds. The 2D characters are the worst aspect of the film's animation as they all look too similar (and all appear pretty healthy, clean and well nourished considering there has been no sunlight for 100 years and there is no explanation about food supplies etc) and are horribly animated in contrast to everything around them, they look terrible against the lush 3D backgrounds because they just don't look like they fit in at all. In the English version the voice acting is the worst I have ever encountered in an animated feature, matching their animated characters the voice actors are wooden and emotionless adding to the general atmosphere of boredom. All in all Sky Blue is just a poor man's 'Spirits Within' without the A list voice talent. Sky Blue is at best mediocre as a visual spectacle, some backgrounds are eye popping, but overall it is nothing special and the plot is short, underdeveloped and predictable. Ghost in the Shell and Advent Children are superior in visuals and story. 4/10 - boring and uninspired, avoid.", "I'm a fan of Sci-fi movies but I'm not going to recommend this movie to anyone and I almost fell asleep in the middle of it. As a Sci-fi genre, there is no futuristic technology to marvel at - just illogical and unexplainable pieces of equipment flying about. As a drama, the story telling is just not credible and lack depth. It gets frustrating to see this Jay character appearing at the most 'convenient' moment to make things happen. As a love story, there is no chemistry. No comedy, no mystery, no thrills, no suspense. It's pure eye-candy sprinkled with some fighting scenes. It's just a story about good versus evil. The evil being organized with leaders and a well equipped army; the good is an untalented loner with the help of a misfit gang. That's how bad the story can be."], "633": ["Bride of the Century aka Hundred Year Bride is a16 episode KTV drama from early 2014. It was billed as a fantasy romance melodrama with a supposed horror element to it. It is not very good, mainly because it's too generic (despite its supernatural theme) and it's too hard to overlook its oft incoherent storytelling.SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: A generational curse haunts a family where the eldest son's first wife will be killed on their wedding night. This family is rich, and another family wants to marry their daughter into it to consolidate their power base, however they too know about the curse. The daughter to be married off doesn't want to die, so her mom and her concoct a plan to find an identical looking woman to pretend to be the first wife so she'll get killed instead, and thus the original daughter and mom can swoop in and marry into the money & power they seek.The girl they get to play the stand-in to the bride to be looks exactly the same, but the 2 girls are total opposites in personality. Forget all the supernatural stuff; this show is the same story these K-dramas tell all the time, i.e. poor girl meets rich guy, rich guy can't stand her at first, poor girl eventually wins everybody over with her kindness and spirit, rich guy falls for poor girl, they're in love but can't be together, rich guy sulks, poor girl cries, everything works out in the end because they were \"fated to be together\". It's an endlessly rehashed tale that only works well if you put some actual thought into the story and writing, and this show does neither of those things very well.This story is also severely lacking in any creativity...Dual secondary love interests?: Check! A half dozen characters faint or have heart attacks at some point?: Check! Rich manipulative evil people?: Check! Everything is destiny?: Check! Everybody's family is endlessly intertwined with everybody else's?..Check! Check! Check! I've seen it all a hundred times before, and seen it done better many, many times. The supernatural aspect really adds nothing to this show of any benefit. In fact (SPOILERS), there is no family curse at all, but nobody knows this at first. There is a ghost though, who wants revenge or peace and/or something depending on the daily script re-writes. As for the overall storytelling and writing, it's hard to forgive the numerous instances of how nonsensical it is at times. I can accept many flaws in logic with fantasy themed K-dramas, but I have to draw the line somewhere. Consider these simple questions that pretty much make the writers look like fools should anyone bother to ask them:1) Why doesn't the one family just move out of the haunted house? 2) Why doesn't the bride to be just simply not marry into the cursed family? 3) How does the mom and daughter plan to pull this charade off when there will be an identical dead body leftover to deal with?...What about marriage license, ID's, fingerprints, the fact that they've committed conspiracy and fraud, etc? The show either tries to answer these questions (and others like them) with only basic curt explanations which make little to no sense, or it doesn't even bother trying to answer them at all. There are gaping plot holes everywhere, and none of the writers seem to even care. There is no effort spent in explaining why the poor girl would even fall for the rich guy; he's basically an ass towards her, then all of sudden she's in love with him so much that she's willing to die just to be with him for one night? Really? And, in the writers' haste to give everyone the growth and resolution treatment at the end of the show, they seem to have conveniently forgotten the fact that several of these characters were perfectly willing to kill our heroine on several occasions. What are they thinking trying to generate any pathos for these characters ? The writing and storytelling is so illogical that it's utterly laughable at times.Obviously, I don't have a whole lot of positive things to say about this show. I will however say that it's shot and produced well, and it smartly keeps to a minimum run time. I did mostly like the 2 leads as well:Lee Hong-gi gets the role of chaebol heir bachelor. I liked him OK here, though he is given a typical part I can't stand on these shows, i.e. he goes from smug to angry to sad to in love, with little to no room in between. Star struck teenage girls might find these roles appealing, but they are extremely limited. Fortunately, Hong-gi's character does get the opportunity to eventually show some more range, and he's not bad when given the chance.Yang Jin-sung plays the female lead in a dual role as greedy construction company daughter and poor girl who plays her sacrificial double. Actually, she plays several other parts on this show as well in historical flashbacks. This is the first time I've seen her in a lead role, and I thought she performed rather well considering all the varying personalities she had to portray.Summary: I cannot recommend this show at all. The plot is as equally clich\u00e9d as it is absurd and the writers seem convinced it's a good idea to shoehorn every mood and genre theme into this show to cover as many bases as possible. Unfortunately, they are in no way creative or intelligent enough to pull this off successfully. If you're going to make a crazy murderous supernatural love story, then stick to your guns and go for it. Don't vacillate between that and a formulaic growth/heal/love story where \"even murderers deserve love in the end\", because you'll just end up with slop like this show.

With minimal resources and no clue what they're doing, they have little chance to succeed, but with a lot of fighting spirit and some good fortune, perhaps they can pull it off (and thus, pay off their debts, save the company, realize their dreams, etc).Full disclosure: I wasn't really planning on watching this show. But, as I often do, I'll give just about any KTV show I can a quick courtesy/test look by checking out an episode or two. If it appears to be any good or something I might like, I'll either keep viewing until it stinks or until I've seen too many episodes to not go ahead and finish it out. This particular show did appeal to me fairly quickly, so I stuck with it to the end.Before going any further, let's get one thing out of the way right off the bat: If you're looking for a K-drama for no other reason than its jammed packed full of pretty young Korean girls, than this is the show for you! One would figure there would have to be at least a few cuties on hand since it's a story about winning a beauty pageant, but, there's probably a good 50 of 'em or so available at any given moment (and they are frequently put to use). This doesn't get racy or overly exhibitionist per se; the story takes place in 1997 Korea (so, it's fairly tame by today's standards), however, there is a clear and consistent effort to get these girls on screen whenever possible.Looking past all the hotties running around in bathing suits and the like, there's a decent underdog drama story to be had here. The primary players are all down on their luck and they need to figure out how to simply survive while trying to maintain their dignity as best as possible. They have a lot of individual differences and personal agendas, but they eventually start bonding little by little. Standing in the way of them is a host of slime ball investor/boss/politician types, some gangsters, and a bevy of backstabbing bitches.The titular Miss Korea is played by Lee Yeon-hee; I've seen her in several previous projects, and while certainly attractive, she's yet to impress me with her acting ability. She really deserves some credit for her performance here though. Whether this is just the result that comes from her own experiences & maturity, a perfectly suitable role, the \"light switch finally going on\", hard work, or whatever, she's quite effective and impressive throughout this show.There's a bit of late '90's nostalgia involved with this show (some occasional big hair, gigantic computer monitors, songs from that era, etc...), but it could otherwise easily be mistaken for a drama that takes place in the present day. I'd even argue that this show's theme is just as relevant now as it was back in '97; there's a significant focus on just trying to make a living during a crappy global economy, along with the enormous amount of pressure & sacrifices relating to succeeding within any form of the Korean entertainment industry. There's also the semi-historical rehash of IMF support for that era, along with the introduction of the legendary BB cream, etc. This all serves to benefit & augment the primary story fairly well.One of the better aspects of this show is its eclectic group of supporting characters and how they're dealt with; these characters are focused on as needed and many of them shine when called upon. The \"elevator girl's\" uncle, father, and extended family have their infrequent moments, and, the actress who portrays the \"Godmother\" of the Miss Korea pageant gives a mesmerizing performance in an important side role. The budding relationship between the aging gangster and cosmetic scientist really takes the cake though; it's such an oddly awkward romance that is really hard not to like in the long run.If this show has one fatal flaw, it's this: \"Where is the eye candy for the female viewers?\"...A typical K-drama will usually have a fairly equal mix of attractive male & female cast members (i.e. for every super sexy Woman, there is usually a smoking hot Man, and for every cute young Girl, there is usually a pretty flower Boy, and so on). Not here though; this is the most disproportionate Korean show I've ever seen in regards to the F/M \"attractiveness ratio\". Lee Sun-kyun is your male lead and he's good looking, but his role calls for him to primarily portray a desperate guy with a consistently pained & nervous demeanor (thus reducing his attractiveness ratio). There's a tall investor type dude who also likes \"elevator girl\", but he's not utilized much and is more of a side character than a romantic interest. Maybe one of nerdy scientists can be considered \"cute\" I guess, but that's about it. So, Sorry ladies! If you're looking for stoic/silent leading men, random shower scene material, and young K-pop hunks, you'll need to look elsewhere.Summary: For a K-drama, I really liked this show for the most part. It's far from perfect, but I found its somewhat offbeat approach and underdog theme to be more than entertaining enough, and it still retains the typical melodrama and themes one would expect from this genre.Bottom Line: 7.5-8 out of 10 stars."], "657": ["Oooh, finally a show that gets me excited.

It's a romantic fantasy themed melodrama that has become very popular in this medium over the last decade or so.This show pulled huge ratings and was a smashing success for its creators. It follows a virtual can't-miss formula for this genre (i.e. good looking actors & actresses in a star crossed love story). The writers of this show certainly know their target audience, and, they delivered exactly what was expected. If you're not part of the target audience however (i.e. guys, people above a certain age, or those that are simply looking for a superbly woven story), this show might not be suited for you.There's a heavy emphasis on catering to \"fan-girls\" throughout this series. This show is basically geared towards young women and it provides a very non-threatening view of relationships accordingly. There's nothing wrong with this, but, I think anyone expecting otherwise should be aware of this from the outset. The female lead basically serves as a proxy for viewers to identify with; she lives the lavish fantasy life-style complete with various trials and tribulations to overcome. Meanwhile, there are 2 handsome rich guys for her to choose from; one is the aforementioned alien & main love interest, the other is her childhood friend that dotes on her endlessly. In an indication of how \"safe\" this show is for young female viewers, the alien love interest is still a virgin and can't even kiss a woman without fainting. He can't handle alcohol either, but he does happen to have chivalrous values, super-powers to protect our heroine, and a rockin' set of abs.The childhood friend represents Plan B for our heroine if things don't work out with the alien. He's walking a very fine line between \"nice guy that will always be there for her\" vs. \"obsessive stalker that won't leave her alone\". This guy's older brother portrays the villain from central casting; he's good looking too, but in a fashionably evil way. He plays your typical Chaebol heir lunatic that must control everything while eliminating everybody that gets in the way, and, this show goes to great lengths to let you know he's \"the bad guy\" every time he appears on screen; he's involved in a number of murder/mystery sub-plots that soon finds him facing off against our two leads.Jun Ji Hyun (Gianna Jun) and Kim Soo Hyun are your two leads; she's the eccentric and conceited top Korean actress, he's the noble alien from Planet \"Korean Hunky Dude\". Gianna Jun is a hugely successful Korean film star, but her presence and style of acting does seem somewhat ill-suited for the small screen; she's a movie star that should be starring in movies, not playing stock KTV \"damsel in distress\" roles. Kim Soo Hyun is a star in the making, and seems to be a capable enough actor; he's given a predictable K-drama male part as the \"stoic white knight\". As such, he's allowed few opportunities to show much range that are afforded these types of roles. The two of them have worked together previously, and they complement each other nicely here. There's a bunch of supporting actors and actresses involved; some current and up and coming talent, along with several K-drama veterans that all did what was asked, but several of these parts were under written and/or non-essential. Acting, overall, was solid throughout.As expected, production values are quite good, and this show comes complete with loads of stylishly beautiful people. Cohesive storytelling is sometimes lacking however; it's clear the writers were just making things up as they went along (which is not really all that uncommon for these shows), but they really pushed the limits on occasion here, and I found this to be quite irritating. The rules governing what will happen to the alien and what he can/can't do are ever changing; his powers come and go when convenient to the plot, he's apparently not allowed to kill humans or he'll die too (yet he somehow managed to serve 50 years in the military throughout various wars without killing anyone), etc... Random side characters come and go too, without ever being appropriately developed within the overall story; the estranged father shows up just in time to donate blood to save his daughter, then he just disappears again for a while, and, I question the need to tie any of this story into the alien's first encounter with an earth girl. I know they were aiming for a fate/destiny angle here, but that girl in the past really has nothing to do with the woman in the present other than looking similar to her. It's this kind of writing that is really annoying to me, and I see no reason why the writers couldn't still appease their target audience while tightening up the story some. And, while I see many people liked the ending, I can't help but point out that it practically negates the importance of everything that occurred prior to it.Summary: This will be well received by the crowd it's aimed at. It's not blatantly immature and has enough decent moments for viewers outside of the \"in-crowd\" to enjoy...I found the little 1st person vignettes throughout the show to be a particularly nice touch. Still, it should have been way better than what it was, and, it could have had the best of both worlds if the producers/writers were willing & able to try a little harder to appeal to a wider audience.Bottom Line: For the right audience, it's 8-9 out of 10 stars. For \"not the right audience\", it's closer to 5-6 out of 10 stars. Split decision leaves it at 7 stars IMO.", "The cutest, craziest, saddest, sweetest Korean drama I've ever seen- although there were handfuls of bitter moments they just made it more thrilling& sweeter. When I first intended to watch this TV drama of my favorite actress Jun Ji Hyun (as I watched and reviewed all her movies and enjoyed a bunch of cute ads also) and went through news of its insane popularity in China, I hardly imagined that a nerd (yet sentimental & melodrama-lover) like me would fantasize and even dream about this fantasy drama throughout the whole show. But as the alien hero professor Do Min Joon ( Kim Soo Hyun) cast his magical spell of mind- blowing coolness (that humble& caring personality really suits him much!), heroine Cheon Song Yi (Jun Ji Hyun)'s cute craziness brought about enjoyable funny moments (even excessive make-ups for lead actress role can't hide her adorable sassy identity) ,cool soundtracks pleased my ears and after all Korean director, script-writer and all the staffs showed expertness in playing with audience's emotions wonderfully as usual so at last it seemed to me- that I loved to be deceived and obsessed in tranquility of fantasy wholeheartedly was destined to happen! Do-Min Joon & Cheon Song Yi- I really loved chemistry of this couple a lot. ^_^", "This drama portrays romantic comedy in a new light. It is more than a romance between an alien and a human but is a mystery/crime show as well. As you watch to determine how the romance will play out, you are also intrigued by why the obviously socio-pathic character is killing people and whether or not he will be caught.The characters are realistic and funny, while not being campy and the outside scenery is beautiful whether reliving 400 years in the past or modern Seoul.The drama is an analogy of trust. Each character has to learn to trust and be trusted. Also, to learn that there are those who no matter how much you love them can not be trusted.From beginning to end, it is well worth watching. The writing, directing and cinematography all excellent which is a rarity for this type of Kdrama.", "A spaceship from another planet lands on earth, in the Josheon era. The people i.e. the aliens explore their place of landing- the nature, the plants, the animals and the humankind inhabiting it. They take samples of minerals, medicinal saplings, and observe the way of life of the humans. They return after satiating their curiosities about earth, the planet that looks so beautiful from space, from their sky. But by a twist of fate, and entangling of destinies, one of them is left behind while saving a young widow from death.He lives on earth, adapting to its climate, food, and people and learning the native language. He knows he is not abandoned, and that he has to wait for a long time to return to his home. He is a fast learner, and has superhuman abilities, as per the earthlings' standards. So meanwhile, he reads a lot of books and learns a lot many skills- those required for survival and some as a hobby. He can teleport within a particular distance, can stop time for about a minute, can mind control nonliving things, has great hearing capabilities, and many more traits. But he understands through time and experience that showcasing his abilities does him and the people around him no good. So he starts living incognito, under different identities.The actual story starts 400 years later, in modern day Seoul. He's presently known as Do Min Joon, a Harvard alumnus, and a professor. Dilemma and confusion starts when he notices the same girl that he once saved, or perhaps someone bearing an exact resemblance to her, after so many years. Is this actress a rebirth, or reincarnation? Is it a totally different person? He enters her life, curiosity getting better of him. Again assuming the role of her protector, ally and savior, he eventually falls for her, way before she realizes her own feelings.Spice to the story is added by the murder mystery that happens to occur in between, involving conspiring millionaires, detectives, and the protagonists' lives; the romantic comedy, the humor and crazy tactics of the leads; and the play of emotions. What happens to their story, when he has to leave earth in a month? Does he really have no attachments? And what happens when his true nature is revealed? Does he finally return to his universe leaving everyone behind? The 21 episodes is an enjoyable roller coaster ride through the story.There is not a single boring moment in the sitcom. There's thrill in every episode, fun and laugh-out-loud scenes too.PS: This is not your ET or 'Koi Mil Gaya'. And aliens here are not ugly and grotesque. They are fairer and more beautiful than normal human being, with a very high lifespan. They are not immortals, nor are they vampires. Vampires don't teleport, remember? So, watch it without presumptions and biases. If you like fantasy, and thrill, you'll enjoy it, sure.", "I wish there could be something more than a rating to rate this show. This is seriously the best thing i have ever seen. The story and the acting is just a perfect blend. I have seen this show for numerous times and still i find it fascinating each and every time. It's really great. The effects are just awesome. For a sight you can't say that it's just a dramatic. It feels so real. The turning points of this drama are so interesting. The transformation of the role from a lead actress to a support actress teaches us ways of acceptance. The show is inspiring as well. Talking about true love, yes , it can be seen here. Overall , It was really awesome.", "Yes, I'm giving this show 9 out of 10 stars (I'm dinging it one star because the logic of how the ending takes place is a bit too much of a stretch). The characters in this show, particularly the heroine are Painful to watch. I am not joking. I would get so upset watching her stupidity I would have to stop watching an episode for the day and come back to watch the rest the next day. That being said, the characters and the story are adorable and incredibly (and surprisingly) likable, including this heroine that is such a ditz. The story is INCREDIBLY addicting and just kept me coming back for more. The special effects (except for one very funny scene with the heroine's little brother) are generally excellent and quite acceptable for the story. The fellow playing the villain did an excellent job playing a sociopath. The writing of his character was great, and there is enough genuine threat against our protagonists to keep me anxious as to how the story could possibly turn out all right given the situations they are put in. It was a lot of fun to watch, but as I said it was also very painful to watch too just because our heroine is painfully stupid sometime. It just hurts watching her stick her foot in her mouth over and over again. But you really do start rooting for this unlikely couple and wondering if they can possibly stay together. I recommend the show if you don't mind subtitles and like screwball romantic comedy with a good dose of thriller and sci-fi thrown in.", "Boys before flowers is also one of my favourite drama series, but You who came from stars is way better than BFF. it have everything. comedy , romance, melodrama, thriller! this drama is so good that you just cant give a break while watching this series.. completed 21 episodes in 3 nights :) highly recommended 10/10 You Who Came from the Stars aka My Love from the Star has 21 episodes plus a 2min full epilogue.The plot isn't as simple as an alien who lands on Earth and randomly falls in love with a famous actress. The famous actress Cheon Song Yi (played by Jun Ji Hyun) has been the nation's #1 star until her fame goes down the drain when she is accused of causing the death of another actress. At the same time, Lee Jae Kyung (Shin Sung-rok) is a serial killer who sets Cheon Song Yi as his target. Do Min Joon (Kim Soo Hyun) has been quiet about his alien identity, but he is now determined to protect Cheon Song Yi. The drama has an original storyline with an alien who has supernatural powers such as teleport and time stopping. What captivates the audience besides the storyline is the personality of the characters. Unique is the right word to describe them. Cheon Song Yi may seem like an arrogant star at first. But very soon, you'll see her true self and feel sympathy for her. She appears to be strong and conceited on the outside, but she is actually lonely and vulnerable on the inside. She is that lovable character who is hilarious and straight forward, not afraid to be embarrassed. Do Min Joon, the alien who laughs at what human beings call love, cannot help but falls in love with her. Seemingly emotionless, he cares deeply for Cheon Song Yi. Problem is that he has to return to his planet in 3 months. This drama is truly worth watching. It never fails to deliver suspenseful, comical and romantic moments.

What about the next story ?", "I am only half-way through this series and completely blown away! For the uninitiated, it's a historical sci-fi romance comedy crime drama. Yes, you heard me right. It somehow mashes up all these genres into one smooth whole and often switches gear, sometimes in mid-scene, without missing a beat. Briefly, it's about a surly alien (Kim Soo-Hyun) stranded on Earth for 400 years trying to get through his last few months before departure without falling in love with his superstar actress neighbor (Jun Ji-Hyun). Jun carries the entire show from episode one, where she first appears to be just another self-obsessed airhead starlet, gradually revealing layer after layer of complexity as the series develops. She has great comedic timing, strong screen presence combined with stunning looks and hits all the right notes of her obnoxious character. The American remake-in-progress should probably just hire her as their lead. I really can't think of who could pull it off as well as she does.Another standout is Kim Hyun-Soo as a headstrong young lady who the alien first comes in contact with, and who may be somehow connected to the events of four centuries later...Sharp, funny writing, great production and costume design, great acting from Jun and the ensemble cast. If you are a fan of sci-fi, romance or any of those genres mentioned above, catch it on Hulu now!", "Far more depth in the side characters than you would expect. Made funny and sometimes poignant by it's metatextual framing within the showbiz world.She's super annoying at the beginning, but then she's supposed to, and she doesn't get 'punished' as much as simply living the life lesson, which I appreciate. I came to genuinely like her as a person.I'm 2/3 into it and I can't say about him and his alien plot yet, but he's brought some lovely comedy as the straight man character.", "Took about 10 years off from watching K-Dramas and returned and boy am I happy.

Her role is different from the typical female leads in kdrama who are shy and poor. She is outspoken and brave to express. Male lead's role is more subtle and low key.

It is logical but at the same time not makes you feel too sad.A must watch.", "Everything just fits well with the review. It's not a \"only romantic\" series. It's full of emotion series.

I wondered how come I couldn't able to watch it before! Kim so hyun has less dialogue compared to Jun hi jyun. But every dialogue of Kim so hyun just touched my heart.

The production values, wardrobes, cinematography, sets and soundtrack are all top notch.

Gianna Jun lacks the humor and comedic timing to be truly funny. This show is meant to be a romantic comedy with lots of quirks with some Scifi thrown in. Kim Soo Hyun the other star is a good actor and Gianna Jun can be good too it's just that when pairing two people who are almost a decade apart who lack chemistry the end result is not romantic and it's not comedic. The end result is you're seeing a show where writers are forcing a ridiculous plot down your throat. A big budget was thrown in here with plenty of overseas marketing, the wardrobe looks glamorous and yes the condo looks great but what the show really needs is for the actors to be funny and sweet and romantic in what is supposed to be a romantic comedy. Moreover, the plot is a rambling confusing mess with some time travel thrown in with a pubescent looking wise alien who falls for a bimbo of a movie star. This is just a great example of a shallow, dispensable, glossy, commercial looking entertainment with no soul with high incessant high budget marketing.", "Can't handle the unfunny jokes, stupid plot, and main characters. I never really liked korean dramas, so I tried to watch one. According to most websites with \"top 10\" titles, this one is in top 2 or even top 1. In my opinion this is one of the worst shows ever created.", "It feels like I'm watching an incredibly mediocre sequel to My Sassy Girl. Jun Ji Hyun is playing practically the same character, but while it was funny in MSG because she and Cha Tae Hyun had hilarious chemistry together, the characters in this show simply lack any charm. Rather than a \"sassy girl\", she comes off as an arrogant bitch. Sure, we'll find out about her dad later and that will be used to stir up sympathy for Song Yi, but I simply don't see any of the characters growing on me. Many deadpan characters exist in movies and drama serials, but for some reason Do Min Joon is simply not likable. All the humor in this drama is beyond forced, and hence made me unable to even crack a smile much less laugh. While some of the special effects are good (like when time stops), others fall below the mark (the opening scenes with the UFO, flying foliage etc). I know a \"1\" rating seems too biased, but to give it more than that requires a reason (which I do not have). The soundtrack is cheesy and as subtle as a sledgehammer. The younger version of Song Yi looks nothing like her. The pace is too draggy to sustain interest. Nobody has any chemistry, and even the delightful Jun Ji Hyun can't redeem this drama for me. All in all, I don't know why the serial is so popular and highly rated.", "The series is interesting, even captivating, until episode 12 or so. Then it starts to become more and more painful to watch as the story writer tries to drag the story out for a few more episodes, and the story becomes more and more bizarre. Yes, it's drama, but still, it's too illogically overly dramatic. There are quite a few unnecessary scenes and side stories. For example, the scene with the father in the hospital (in episode 15) is just unnecessary garbage. Clearly the director was just trying to fill up some airtime. If I grit my teeth and skip through the bad parts, the whole series is not too bad. I just wish I didn't have to do so much teeth gritting."], "658": ["The Prime Minister & I. Korean TV Drama17 episodes Late 2013 - Early 2014.SPOILERS AHEAD!Be forewarned; I have very few positive things to say about this show. Perhaps if you're a younger viewer, haven't seen very many K-dramas, or a huge fan of a particular Girls' Generation member, than this show might work for you. Otherwise, you're probably better off watching something else.Here's your story: A prime minister needs a new wife for himself and a new mother to his 3 little brats. A young reporter wishes to find a proper man to marry to grant her dying father's wish. The prime minister & young reporter are completely mismatched, yet they are forced to be together for some preposterous reason. Romance, comedy, and melodrama are supposed to ensue as the young reporter slowly wins the hearts & minds of the prime minister & his kids over time.The Prime Minister & I follows a standard blueprint for this genre, but there is very little effort devoted to any creativity here, and therein lies the bulk of this show's problems. Everything about this show is overly formulaic, and it's quite clear this show is just going through the motions right from the get go; the litany of stock clich\u00e9s, plot points, predictable characters, circumstances, etc. are as endless as they are unexpected. As a result, there was never a moment during this show where I was truly engaged with the story itself or anyone involved. As a seasoned K-drama viewer, this show did not go over very well with me, and I've seen everything it had to offer done much better in many other shows both past & present.This show doesn't waste any time letting you know how weakly written it's going to be. The dialogue is not particularly bad, but the overall storytelling is quite lacking. They couldn't even think of a proper mechanism to have the two main characters be together in the first place; believe it or not, this is it: A photographer takes some after-hours pics of the two leads together. These pics go public, but they aren't really scandalous or even newsworthy, and they could easily be explained away as the innocuous photos they actually were. Instead of simply rectifying the situation, the two leads reason that it would be better to pretend they are dating to avoid a scandal. This subsequently leads to them both agreeing to pretend to be married to further the fa\u00e7ade they've created. The prime minister somehow thinks all of this will help protect and advance his political career, and the reporter girl somehow thinks this is an acceptable way to make her father happy before he dies. Unfortunately, none of this makes any sense whatsoever. I've seen a lot of tenuous motives for two people to be together in K-dramas over the years, but this is quite possibly the dumbest one ever; there is no logical reason or benefit for the prime minister to agree to any of this, and the reporter girl's father can hardly even remember who his daughter is (much less determine if she's married or not) thanks to his severe and highly selective bout of Alzheimer's (i.e. he conveniently gets worse or better according to what's useful to the plot at any given time).You're introduced to the secondary cast as the story unfolds; they are the standard jumble of anticipated characters (the annoying kids, the annoying housekeeper, the annoying alternative love interests, the annoying uncle/step-brother antagonist, etc). Every one of these roles is written as a tired stereotype that's devoid of any range or depth. As a result, I did not care about any of these characters, what their motives or personal problems were, or how their story-arcs were progressed & resolved. They were nothing more than mere nuisances and contrivances throughout the story, and were so bland and one dimensional that I couldn't be concerned enough to like or hate any of them.Lethargic storytelling manifests itself throughout this entire show. This is never more evident wherever the secondary love interests are concerned; these 2 are attracted to the 2 leads, but their reasons for liking them are never fleshed out in any meaningful or convincing manner. It's as if the writers simply said \"Here's the designated secondary love interests/antagonists because it's mandatory we include them\". There is very little romance or comedy to be had in this show either, and both of these aspects rarely hit acceptable marks; what passes for comedy (and often romance for that matter) basically consists of the two leads accidentally falling into each other's arms again and again while trying to avoid some faintly awkward misunderstandings. There are a few early dream sequences that actually had some comedic promise, but this is never fully capitalized on. Ultimately, neither the comedy nor the romance works very well during this show, and the romance angle isn't helped any by the dubious pairing of the two main leads to begin with.Lee Bum Soo plays the prime minister, and Im Yoo Na portrays the reporter girl. He's a veteran of Korean films whose been popping up in KTV dramas more recently, and she's a K-Pop star turned actress that's about 15 years his junior. Needless to say, they aren't really well suited to act opposite each other in a show like this in the first place, and, this does manifest itself on-screen...they each do \"OK\" by themselves, but the required chemistry between them never quite materializes to help benefit this show.Summary: While not outright terrible, this show simply doesn't work very well as a whole. It lacks too many of the necessary ingredients to be a compelling watch. It's neither romantic enough, intelligent enough, amusing enough, creative enough, or dramatic enough, and, thus not memorable enough. There are some occasional worthwhile &/or endearing moments here and there, but not nearly enough to recommend.Bottom Line: 5 out of 10 stars.", "This drama is just okay. It actually reminds me of the american sitcom The Nanny. There was a nice home-y feeling that this drama projected, which was the highlight of the drama, along with the cameo of Exo's leader, Suho.

The two main leads Ha Ji Won (Empress Ki) and Joo Jin Mo (Wang Yu) were wonderful as well as the other cast members. However, it is Joo Jin Mo who steals the show in every scene with his strong delivery and intense eyes. Other noticeable performances came from Jeon Kuk-Hwan (El Temur), Jin Yi-Han (Tal Tal) and Baek Jin-Hee (Danashiri). The first 40 episodes were fast paced, dramatic and humorous with great action sequence. But the last 11 episodes were rushed, low budget, illogical and laughable, but I still give this show a 9 out of 10 because of the earlier episodes. The worst part of this show comes from the last four episodes where every major character dies one cruel and unnecessary death from another. Was it really necessary to kill off Maha, Yon Feisu and Wang Yu in such ridiculous manner? And why would Kolta and the Empress Dowager betray the Emperor Togon? And yet, the worst part was when Emperor Togon becomes an alcoholic and loses his mind and has hallucinations and his judgment becomes greatly impaired. The show is still worth watching because of the acting, however, the actors deserved a better script in the end. Maybe the show would have been better off if they ended it with 40 episodes. There is no point of continuing a show if the intention is to rush for an ending. It just seems too obvious that they had an obligation for 51 episodes.", "Actress Ha Ji Won is amazing as a super tough, smart, and beautiful woman who fights her way from slavery to the pinnacle of power in China.

I was so caught up in the story that I finished watching all 51 episodes in less than two weeks. To be honest, at first I didn't know what to expect as I haven't watched many Asian dramas, but this one got me really interested in the history of Yuan and Koryo, and helped me understand their way of life and customs (I know it is just a show, but still helpful to a European). I'm already looking for a new Yuan and Koryo era shows. The first episodes had a lighter theme, with brave characters fighting for the good of people, and even though there were deaths and betrayals involved it wasn't heavy on the heart. Later the show gets darker, with much more intrigues, and I must admit that they might have gone too far with that. The scenery, the costumes, the cinematography were breathtaking. The instrumental music was fitting, even though for some reasons they used calming music in battle scenes. The acting was brilliant. Joo Jin Mo (Wang Yoo) stole my heart so much that I will never get over all the sadness he felt after losing the love of his life. He did an excellent portrayal of an unhappy but dignified brave man. I liked the scenes with the first Empress and Sung Nyang, and the little tricks they played on each other were funny to watch. I give it a 9/10 because there were some plot holes, and a few silly scenes, but my overall impression is that it is worth watching. Also, the two ending scenes (one with Sung Nyang and the Emperor at the palace, and the final one with the trio at the beach) were heartbreaking, even though I was hoping for a happy ending. It may not be an original portrayal of the Empresses life, but it is still a good historical drama worth watching. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.", "An epic Korean drama based on a real person, although I am sure her life was a struggle it was no where near what the fictional empress had to endure. The plot involves a lowly girl from Korea rising to become an empress of the Chinese Yuan empire. It is really good to see such a strong female lead and the revenge she takes upon the people who have hurt her or her family shows a woman can be as ruthless as any man. Running through most of the 51 episodes is a question of who she actually loves, is it the King of Korea or the Emperor of Yuan. The series leaves it open to interpretation and many people continue to debate giving their reasons by what they have viewed and what it means to them. I desperately want it to be one but sadly I believe it may be the other. I have given the series 9 stars as though it becomes a little plodding in the middle and there are a few too many flashbacks it is still well worth the time.", "A very well - written script , a greatly acted drama and amazing scores. I did not watch many Korean series but this is the best I have seen to date . Thanks for all hearted work. Warmest regards from Turkey.

He acts vividly the role of a coward boy king. This is especially true when one compare with Healer, in which he is a brave, smart and manly hero. He can act equally well. His acting skill is superb in different and contrasting roles.The story of Empress Ki itself drags too long, and makes it not economical to watch. Anyway i manage to finish it in a high speed, promising myself not to see long drama again.", "The best historical drama I've watched so far and Ha Ji Won as Empress Ki really nailed it. I was completely into this drama because of her. Her acting was absolutely convincing and great especially once she enter the palace and became the concubine and whenever she was plotting something or fighting. The other actors were great too, I love almost everything about this drama, ALMOST, because some rather frustrating development of the story toward the end, and also I wish there's more to the emperor character but I close my eyes for that because majority of the story were great, enjoyable and addicting. Over all I give this drama a 10.", "OK. So this is the best k drama that I have ever watched.Even as a historical drama its one of the best I have ever seen. The plot is unique. Its about a woman who had to betray her lover for higher political aims and for vengeance. I think I have never seen a more mesmerizing and stronger female character than empress Ki. She is brave. She is an amazing strategist, an emotionally strong person.I honestly love her. But more than that I loved Wang yu and it broke my heart to see him dying and to see maha dead. The acting of the characters was brilliant throughout. Everyone from bang and jombak and YomFeisu make you cry. There was too much tragedy in the end. I could never get over the fact that wang yu had to lose maha and eventually himself but the emperor gets to live happily with nyang. The relationship between them was nothing compared to that of yu and nyang. Nyang may have been a huge support for the emperor but nobody loved and protected nyang like wamg yu. I have honestly no idea why people ship the emperor with nyang. OK. Personal opinions aside. Some may find the final ten episodes as predictable or unnecessary. But I think it was important to highlight on the character development of both Bayan and Tal tal. And how eventually even the most patriotic of men can turn corrupt with power. There was one tiny problem though. I felt that the reason we love Nyang and Wangyu so much is because their idea is too romantic. They are too perfect and too white to exist in reality. And maybe that's why they weren't meant to be together.", "I do not write reviews but this kept up every night for four hours I could not stop watching. What a GREAT SHOW my only complain is I wish it was dubbed in English. Bravo to the Korean movie industry.", "Loser hero I hate this drama huifjif4srusirditztzirzitx"], "667": [], "668": [], "669": ["Marry Him if You Dare is a 16 episode KTV drama that aired in late 2013. Be advised, this show has several different English titles; it's aka Mi-Rae's Choice, The Future Choice, etc.This show is primarily a rom-com drama with a fantasy element to it. These fantasy K-drama shows never get old; but, ONLY if it's done right!...This show gets it right for the most part, and it's pretty good overall.SPOILERS AHEAD!Our story begins by introducing the main character (Mi Rae) as a struggling 30-something year old woman trying to find her way in the world; she's had zero luck in both her personal & professional affairs to date, and her directionless approach to life isn't helping matters any. Enter Mi Rae # 2; this is the elder version of our younger Mi Rae. The elder Mi Rae has traveled back in time to stop her younger self from being an aimless loser who continually makes the wrong decisions (the results of which will ultimately be their mutual downfall).Other than the addition of the time travel premise, this show is basically a standard K-drama tale involving the relationships between 2 girls and 2 guys. Yoon Eun Hye takes the lead as the younger Mi Rae; Eun Hye often plays this type of part, and she is very good in her role as usual. Veteran actress Choi Myung Gil nicely portrays the elder Mi Rae. Together, these two actresses strike a nice balance between older and younger versions of the same woman (although you will have to discount the fact that they look absolutely nothing like each other). Joining the two Mi Raes in their adventures to change the future are your 3 stereotypical love interest counterparts; they consist of the 2 hunky male leads, along with the \"gorgeous other girl\". These 3 are quite good in their roles, and they're about what you'd expect from a show like this. Here's your summary of them:1. TV anchorman (Lee Dong Gun): The primary male lead who the younger Mi Rae must not get involved with at all costs. He's a bit older and polished, and he quickly takes a liking to Mi Rae when she joins his broadcast team. He can be a little temperamental and stubborn at times, but is mostly appealing enough as a suitable love interest for our heroine.2. Rich young business heir (Jung Yong Hwa): He's pretending to be an anonymous VJ at his family's broadcasting company while he learns the business from the ground up. He's a good looking charmer that's very reasonable despite some occasional immaturity. He represents the younger potential love interest available to Mi Rae, and, he falls for her right away too.3. Reporter Girl aka the \"gorgeous other girl\" (Han Chae Ah). She just can't seem to find someone, anyone, to love her no matter how hard she tries. Suitable partners should be lining up around the block to catch this woman; alas, such is the life of being the \"gorgeous other girl\" in these K-dramas. She's a bit of a sly fox when it comes to trying to land herself an appropriate guy of course, but she's far from being overly loathsome.This show gets off to a pretty decent start. The entire cast interacts really well with each other right from the get go, and no one is made out to be a true antagonist; nobody's perfect by any means, but they're all fairly amiable and well-meaning for the most part. The story is fairly interesting and economically paced as well, and there's little to no time wasted on irrelevant &/or pointless side plots. There's also loads of amusing extras deftly sprinkled in that provide some nice touches to the entire proceedings (from bleeped out cursing, to post production screen visuals & sound effects, to voice overs & first person camera angles, etc). Everything is kept light and tight from the beginning, and as a result, this show had all the makings of huge winner (ratings notwithstanding).Unfortunately (and, perhaps, inevitably), this show slowly begins to go in a different direction as it subtly changes its tone from mostly rom-com to mainly drama. The transition is actually handled pretty well here, but the show does become a lot less charming as it progresses. It never gets terrible or overwrought with too much melodrama, but the nuances that made it incredibly appealing from the outset get stripped away one by one; gone are the comedic aspects, the catchy tunes to whistle along to, the general camaraderie and playfulness that permeated the early part of the show, and so forth. After a while, the elder Mi Rae becomes somewhat of a 5th wheel as the 'future implications' story line is deemed less important, and, the Reporter Girl is soon rendered irrelevant to the plot as well. Eventually, even the romantic appeal to the show disappears, and, all that's left is to watch the M & F leads slog through their regular routines for a while as the story winds down.All in all, I did rather like this show, and I will recommend it. However, I'm a little disappointed that it wasn't committed to staying its original course. I sat down and started watching a witty romantic comedy with a time travel sub-plot, and ended up watching a rather mundane drama about the daily lives of everyday people. The odd thing is the drama part was pretty good; it's not over the top and much closer to reality than most K-dramas, and I absolutely loved how the relationships & lives of everyone involved were ultimately resolved (in the\" life goes on\" sense). I really don't have any practical complaints to levy at this show, but, it did somewhat ruin all the fun I was having (and was further expecting) when I started watching it in the first place.Bottom Line: 7.5 out of 10 stars."], "670": ["This story is set 3 years prior to the first series and has a brand new cast except Sung Dong Il and Lee Il Hwa who return as the protagonist's parents.

After visiting Bing Gue Re at the Boarding house Chil Bong becomes a permanent visitor because he loves the family like atmosphere that is shared in the house as opposed to the coldness he has grown up with.\nSseu Re Ki is the son of a family friend who has been living with Na Jung's family to pursue his academics in medicine and he is the oldest of the lot.\nYoon Jin is a quiet and reserved girl who knows just one thing - Seo Taiji and Boys.

I had completely forgotten about Deli Spice after having watched the Classic and thanks to this show they are back on my playlist!\nThis show teases us about who is married to Na Jung in the present day.

I love it so much, there's no boring conversation inside this movie, i never wanted to skip any part of the movie, i can feel the love, the struggle, the good and the bad times in this movie, i really recommend this movie to you guys :)", "Reply 1994 is a mix of Reply 1997 and Reply 1988, and somehow it makes it work. The story centres around a girl, whose parents rent rooms for college students at Seoul. The viewers are asked to guess with whom the girl is going to end up with. In addition, we have the stories of the other college students and events that occur in the 1990's. For me, Reply 1994 was better than Reply 1988, though the main reason why I didn't like Reply 1988 was the length and in Reply 1994 the episodes got longer and longer but never reached the two hours (fortunately). I especially liked the episodes where the characters from Reply 1997 appeared and it was quite funny to watch. Moreover, Reply 1994 offers the family drama that Reply 1988 also has, but also the humour and the funny situations that Reply 1997 had. So, 5 out of 10, because it's a good drama, only way too long (it could have ended in 18th episode).", "I absolutely loved this show. It's got everything you could want to watch. Loved all the characters and the way the plot went from 1994 to 2013 and back. Couldn't wait to see who Na Jung married and what happened to everyone. Loved how it ended and would like to see them all reunite! Had lots of humor in it and kept you laughing throughout! You were really interested in every character too. I couldn't wait to see everyone of these characters and how each ended up. Enjoyed the parents also. I mean, they were the coolest parents! And so funny together. Liked them better than in Reply 1997. Definitely loved 1994 over 1997 and I really liked how they put the characters of 1997 in this one too. (Cameos) Really recommend this show!", "I really enjoyed this show! Mostly it was awesome going back to 1994. It was cool seeing how they lived and such. I loved the storyline, especially them all being boarders of our main casts family then becoming friends. It was awesome! The actors did a great job and I didn't feel the need to skip through any scenes. I was pleased with the ending, although I wished our characters had gotten married sooner, I reckon I can understand why they waited. It's just shows how different culture is for sure! (I'm in the US) Anyways, If you enjoyed reply 1988 and 1997 you'll enjoy this one as well!"], "671": [], "672": ["I started watching this drama primarily for the cast - Kwon Sang Woo, Ju Ji Hoon, and Jung Ryeo Won, in particular (some of my favorite actors) - but even so, was still pretty interested in the premise of it. It actually started off pretty well - established the characters, the potential main conflict, romantic pairings - but then it became very draggy and slow as the first half of the series unfolded. I felt like nothing was truly happening, just back and forth running to the Vice President which in turn made the Top Team consistently volatile. I felt like the politics got a little too heavyhanded that it took away from any actual focus on the Top Team's functioning. I wanted to see more medical cases that involved the patients in the story without a myriad of extenuating complications brought about by the VP. I guess that was kind of the point, for the VP to keep pressuring the MTT, but it just got too tedious when every single episode that was the problem. The Top Team never even truly got running before it was immediately torn down, so in that regard I was disappointed.Large disappointments also arise with the plot (always meandering, never really focusing on and finishing each problem), but the character development was extra dismaying. We never got in depth backstories, no true insight to any of their intentions. No one really grew. The closest I'd say to have developed would be JJH's character Chief Han: we knew he has high ambitions primarily because he wants the approval of his father, we have the angst of his alcoholic single mother dying, we have him struggling with administration's expectations of him and his personal principles. KSW's character Park Tae Shin started off promising, but felt kind of forgotten in the second half of the series. Nothing really happened with his own mom angst, he was completely out of the MTT altogether so he mostly didn't fit in the main conflict anymore, which is quite confusing when he was billed to be the main lead? What I'm most mad about was JRW's character Seo Ju Young, though. Here was a potentially amazing female character: brilliant in her field, independent, ambitious, a prime example of a woman who's worked so hard to be strong so that she could excel even in a profession dominated by asshole men (mostly Chief Jang). I'm guessing they wanted her to kind of be like Cristina Yang from Grey's Anatomy in the way that she prioritizes her career and by doing so is seen as an emotionless robot. From her character introduction and initial episode appearances, they wanted her backstory to be something family related as well. What happened to that? Halfway through the series it was like she had no family at all. Nothing was really fueling her character by the end of the series. In the first half she at least had her ambition, but as the series closed her interest in keeping the Top Team running was entirely devoid of any reason. It was utterly disappointing to see considering she was my favorite character coming off the first few episodes. Romance wise, I was actually extremely pleased with how the lovelines turned out. I'm moreso saying this in terms of Chief Han and Seo Ju Young getting together as compared to Park Tae Shin and Choi Ah Jin (Oh Yeon Seo's character, who, as sad as I am to say it, was pretty much a useless character and only used as a prop. Like wth with that brain tumor nonsense at the end of the series? I will say they're cute, though, but thats mostly because Oh Yeon Seo is cute). In the beginning, I was seeing the connection between PTS and SJY - the cliche of \"upbeat man changes cold and standoffish girl\" - and was pretty okay with it. I didn't feel too invested, but I could see their potential. So I get it when people say that the turn of main lovelines from PTS/SJY to Chief Han/SJY was kind of confusing, because I also felt like midway through the series they just completely dropped developing the PTS/SJY relationship - they barely interacted, and when they did it was just to discuss a case superficially. But I feel like HSJ/SJY made the most sense to become the romantic endgame of the show - they have history, going all the way back to med school, that really propelled their relationship to me. Of course that shouldn't be the main criteria for a couple to end up together, but in terms of personality and work ethic, I think they were also perfectly matched. I see that people were saying that it didn't make sense because they always felt like SJY never showed any signs of reciprocating Chief Han's feelings, but in my opinion there were signs that she had a soft spot for him just as he had for her (his was just softer's, lol). You could see it when she smiled at seeing HSJ be happy about receiving praise from his father, which seems to imply that she knows how much he craves for that approval. She also seems to know the nature of his relationship with his mother (when she crashes their private dinner), and the issues he has with it, ergo asking him out to dinner to cheer him up. You could see how endeared she was to see him eat so sloppily too lol, as if it humanized him to her after so long of keeping up their professionalism. From my POV it wasn't that she lacked any feeling for him, it's just that she was always hesitant and, I feel, purposefully distant from him because she didn't want people to continue to think that the only reason for her success is because she's riding on his coattails and affections. That's one of the main conflicts with them so I think that's the reason for most of their emotional distance. I do like that she could be a pillar of strength for him by the end, especially with his mom dying, kind of turning the tables to the fact I've mentioned: it's not her that needs him, but the opposite. Chief Han's subtle proposal in the last episode was amazing, but mostly due to the fact thaf SJY was asleep while he was saying it haha! It was such a perfect way to close their story. As much as I liked their romance, I still came out of watching the series wishing that JJH and JRW would do another drama together with an actually good script, because they had great chemistry in MTT but was just failed by the writing.Overall, I'd say Medical Top Team was an okay watch. Not completely terrible, but definitely far from stellar. Watch it if you have a lot of free time, but if not, there's really not much you're missing out on (shallow moment, which I'm allowed to have at least once in a review!: besides Ju Ji HOON looking the best he's ever done, of course.)"], "673": [], "674": ["I liked this drama although I think that it could have been better. I liked the development of Jong Dae's and Seung Hee's characters through the flash backs but I think that there needed to be more said about the other characters as well for example Wan Ha for me really came out of nowhere we see him once in college hanging out with Gwang Pal and Hyo Sang while they watch Jong Dae and Seung Hee on a date then years later they catch up as friends? I think that they needed to show how the guys came to be friends with Wan Ha. I also would have liked to see a resolution to the 'misunderstanding' between the two leads themselves rather than them just finding out from someone else and accepting it. It also would have been nice to see a climax to the situation the Seung created with Chang Soo's mother i feel as though that was cut off at the mid point and forgotten about. The last thing that I think could have been better handled is the ending I like that the leads were able to reconcile and marry but I am sure that there are many people out there like myself who really liked the second leads and would have liked to see more of a resolution to their relationships with lead characters. I myself feel as though there was no closure there and it leaves me feeling a little unsatisfied but overall it was a sweet story and worth the watch."], "675": ["Rarely do some creative content come that deliver a truly gratifying experience and I wouldn't be wrong to say that Stranger/Forest of Secrets is part of that consortium. Writing/Cinematography/Editing: These three form a fragile pyramid that some dramas aren't able to fully comprehend and implement but Stranger isn't like that. The composition of the above three is such that the story progresses seamlessly. The only thing abrupt would be your own heartbeat, ha ha. The screenplay pools you in, like a magnet, from the first episode itself, binding you inside its sly labyrinth of deft writing. Characters: aren't fictitious, and by that I mean the characters are portrayed in such a crude fashion wherein you wouldn't fully like or dislike either one, they are in a sense, truly human like and not far-fetched. They all have their faults and strengths, they're not necessarily bad or good. I'm not saying you won't form favorites, of course, we all love our protagonist Hwang Si-mog, he is someone who's so elemental, you can't forget him. Every actor has traveled so deep into their characters, watching their work unfold is really engaging. Personally, after first seeing Jo Seung-woo in Inside Men, I have grown such a liking to him, I can't explain. He's just brilliant.Music: the composition is such that it is subtle yet striking at the same time, complementing the arrangement of scenes in the drama in an aesthetically satisfying manner. The music sets the mood so perfectly, it really is pleasurable.I have never written reviews about a drama/film/song and whatnot before but upon completion of this Drama, I felt compelled to say a little, at least something about it. I want more and more people to appreciate what has been given to us in the form of this Drama. A political, psychological, legal thriller that is bound to be memorable. Needless to say, Stranger has now become my utmost favorite Korean-drama I have ever watched. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT HESITATE TO WATCH THIS. I wanted to write an essay on this but I guess I'll stick to a precis, I hope my words were enough to impel you to start watching this.Lastly, be prepared to question morals, motives, ethics and torment your brain contemplating what will get thrown at you in the next episode, brace for heart-wrenching, nerve-racking moments, because this drama will, most certainly, take you on a ride, you won't forget. Enjoy!My rating: 9.5 out of 10.", "I have to confess that I am a k-drama addict, but that said, this is by far one of the best Korean TV dramas ever - surpassing not just the usual run of Asian dramas, but also most US TV dramas.This show is from a new writer, her first TV script. I think it will not her last. The main star for me is Bae Doona, who I first came across in \"Sense 8\". The show is absent many of the far too common k-drama tropes that make so many of them seem rather silly - like dozens of totally incompetent cops, the stupid sidekick that is supposed to be funny but seldom is, and several others. A very tightly written script with almost no \"WTF?\" moments.", "The story and characters were absolutely amazing!!! Shi Mok Hwang and Yeo Jin Han have soon become among my favourite characters ever and I already miss them. I really hope there will be a follow up of their story. The series is a great chance to understand Korean culture and it can compete with the best series around the world. The whole plot and reconstruction is very realistic and all the cast is superb, all characters very detailed and true, it's one of the best series/movie I ever seen. It gives addiction! I look forward Shi Mok to come back to Seoul and to lieutenant Han!", "I have more than hope for all the best in the future for the writer of this drama! My favorite was Bae Doona, but that is a personal reference, all of the acting cast did splendidly, they delivered their roles magnificently and the script was majestic! I watch at least 3 k-dramas per month, and this is... one of the best, if not the best drama I've seen so far! I kept wondering throughout the series if the script was made by a Korean person, because it lacks all of the washed out clich\u00e9s, the story is excellently thought through, characters are deep and the point itself explores the corruption, and the bad deeds done by very influential people who occupy high places within a country. Forest of Secrets set a new bar for dramas, and I really hope we'll get the chance to see something else from the author soon!", "Just finished this superb Korean drama in a three-day binge. There are many things to review to be fair, but I'll be brief...The overall story regards mass political and corporate corruption, cover-ups and backstabbing. However, the story opens with something less subtle: murder.But it is how this initial murder then spirals into a plethora of lies, greed and downright nastiness that is absorbing to watch. The plot is never still, but not rushed. The characters are always fleshed out, but most have something to hide. The cinematography is on point but seductive. And the music... wow, it is brilliant (even though parts of the main theme reminded me of The Da Vinci Code bizarrely).What we have here is not explosions and car chases. I found it to be character- and plot-driven brilliance with some fantastic acting. Enjoy the story, enjoy the twists, enjoy the red herrings. And enjoy the soju and noodles!9 out of 10. Highly recommended.", "I can count on the fingers of my one hand the series that I could consider at par or better than this. On every count it is an absolute winner. I have always believed that a true thriller is more cerebral than physical. The action happens by way of intellectual warfare than actual gunfights and muscled maniacs showing us all kind of choreographed war dances. This series is absolutely such a production, but make no mistake it neither lags nor allows your attention to waiver. Towards the end narrative could have been tighter and it could have gone in another direction. But perhaps that just comes down to personal preferences and cultural perspectives. All in all a highly recommended thriller and hands - down a shoo - in to my personal all time favourites. Kudos to the production team as well as the actors.Excellent!", "The poster of this show caught my eye on Netflix as it had Doona Bae in it. Excellent story-telling techniques combined with the background score makes it a must-watch show, even if you do not understand the language (Netflix has excellent subtitles for this).The plot is intriguing and unpredictable. The only other show I've watched which is comparable to this one is Death Note, which was an anime.", "First of all, I loved the background music - its gripping. It a very well written and executed how, with good story line and acting. You wont know anything until the very end, and keep doubting every character. Its a decently paced show, and you wont find one boring moment - amidst all revelations, blame games and well, causalities! Also gives you a sneakk peak into the power game in South Korea. Give it a try if you like suspense thrillers. You wont be disappointed!", "I keep hearing that South Korea is the emerging giant in producing great TV series in a variety of formats: comedy, fantasy, spy-intrigue or (in this case) police-mystery. Mercifully, this one ends after 16 episodes - I say that, since, once you get hooked on these series, nothing else scheduled in your life happens. You are glued to the set as the mystery deepens and unfolds (I watched a 20-parter in 2016, and after 20.9 episodes, the good guy -- on his way with a ring to marry the girl he fell in love with in episode 3-- gets picked off by a sniper. Aaaauuuughhhh!. Meantime, my car was repossessed, and my wife ran off to join the circus. But, what great series!In this case, 'Stranger' (as named on Netflix) follows the trials of Prosecutors Huo-Jin (Bae Doona, who appears to be the Sandra Bulloch of Korean miniseries) and Huang (Jo Suang-Hoo) as they investigate a few murders and attempted murders of police accomplices and 'ladies-in-waiting' - and, eventually, a pretty young prosecutor, who seems to have a bit of a crush on Huang. Higher-ups seem to be behind the crimes, and the script certainly gives the impression that the Korean culture is dominated by title, authority and political favors on the part of elitists in the Police Force and business. Huang, though, is relentless and strictly business. He has a personality defect that causes a lack of empathy or emotion. So, he shares only what he needs to, and in as few words as possible. I haven't quite finished the series, but I don't expect to see him in a passionate affair with any of the available female characters. He has the charm & appeal of a pack of tin foil--a cross between Spock and Monk. He's smart, though and the higher-ups are terrified he will finally tumble onto their nefarious secrets.Music and sets are delightful, characters are rich and continually developed, and the cinematography is brilliant and imaginative. New twists unfold every episode, keeping you compelled to keep watching.. 9/10 - Enjoy!", "I am still 1/2 an episode away from the ending of the show, yet I'm lamenting, savouring the demise of this very, very good show.No, the show is not perfect, but darn close. Here, I will neither lead off nor delve into what I see are the minor short comings but instead try to elaborate on the secret of this show's success.The story revolves around how a prosecutor unearths the details and convoluted dealings that is behind an initial murder of a shady character. One of the key element of the story is that this prosecutor has a unique physical (and thus related emotional) flaw. This flaw allows him to be almost devoid of emotions, but brilliant (almost to a fault) at deductive reasoning, theories correlation, and stone-cold, unrelenting, unapologetic, and unflinching resolve. This character flaw also provide the storyline with one of the most explosive yet unusual, non- action based climax (1 of 2 near the ending). For this, the audience is the scapegoat in soaking up all the tension in between. This character trait, I believe is absolutely necessary, to serve both the seriousness of the subject matter, and the 'burden' of the plot.This leads to another great component of the show and that is the overall tone. The constant pressure, mystery, event after event (constructed in great detail) that unfolds seemingly backs the 'good' guys into a tight corner. All this done in a serious, nonchalant, no extra fat, point to point, manner. While there is only just a small, right amount,of understated comic relief. This goes against most other formulaic Korean detective show of over the top funny characters.A third key of success is the balance of characters. The balance of the female lead oppose to the male lead. Officer Han is just as tough, physically and mentally, has a sense of justice that pairs along with a sense of doubt. This does not mean she is weaker in any sense, but instead more human. A fine touch is how she likes to sketch and scribbles with a pencil. Also must be noted is subtle variation of characters in both the prosecution and police staff. The writing provides its characters with varying level of moral, ethical, and conscientious standards. Some people change, some don't.Other elements that are not so common in K dramas. No clearly stated development of romantic relationships for the main leads. No prolong, repetition of pop-song heavy based, unnecessary flashbacks. No over sentimental gratuitous tug of the heart strings. No over stylized cinematography. No must see next episode ending to every episode. And there is no over the top, fantastic human feats, or earth shattering twist of the plot. Lastly, but to a lesser extend is the reduced dependence on dialogue. But instead through use the camera angles and movement, specific thoughts and facial expressions of the characters to move the storyline along. This is especially so in the first few episodes. That means some information are not from given through the exchange of dialogue, not a directly feeding of the plot line to the viewer, but instead implied or visually taken care of.And as the mystery slowly reveal itself, the audience is not taken for a ride but instead is going along for the ride, side by side with the task force. What a pleasure for us the audience to have this quality writing and what eyes for director and producer to trust the strength of this writing, too.", "Wow, what a series. I've never seen anything like it. IT IS SO WELL DONE. It is a pity though that IMDB has the title of this as \"Forest of Secrets\" because Netflix has this as \"Stranger\". People looking up \"Stranger\" will find nothing and its a pity because it gets such great reviews.", "I could not stop thinking about it for a week after I've finished watching.", "Its very rare that a Korean TV Drama would compel me to write a review in India .This one did. I will try to be brief in my reasons why.. (Kindly bear with me in my Korean names; all based on English translation)The Plot : Its really not out of the world. South Korea is under the grip of rampant political corruption. This one borrows from that and adds a murder mystery to solve. Add a few twists/ turns and you get a regular pot boiler.The Cast: The lead Simhok :Stoic , Brilliant Detective Han: Lively , emotional , Humane Chang Jun Lee: The guy who nods his head into your approval Chairman Lee of Hanjo group: The calculative villain Chang Jun Lee's wife: Almost your vamp. A lot of other characters which fill their positions wellStereotypes: All phones are Samsung , All cars Hyundai LG , Kia motors also exist !!Korean Life: Asian country like us. Mannerisms , gentle bowing , traditional practices , emotional outbursts blended with a much more adaptation of life in Seoul portrayed with lovely details. Detective Han's place over looked a bridge , brilliant cinematography. Neat , minimalist offices .Chemistry : The Main highlight of this series. The scenes between protagonist /Chang jun lee/ Chairman Lee are amazing. Special reference to scenes at funeral of Eyun so, Detective Han and son of Mr Park(murdered) , Detective Han and Mr Joon(The murderer) , Mr Joon at his confession ....Brilliant ! , Outstanding !!...The way the photo of Chang Jun Lee falls soon after his suicide. Cinematic Excellence.Background Score : The music director has created a heart wrenching score with underlying mystery theme. It is so Korean , yet so universal. The crescendo in most scenes as they climax is breathtakingly complemented to say the least.The Directors: Its always easy to make a story , however it takes a vision to make History. This series will easily go down as one of the best ever made , just because of the vision and Character portrayal.Loved this show. Hope to see something similar in future!!!P.S: Can you explain why Korean Won is devalued so much? and why Korean folks speak so little English :)", "This is the first time that I've seen a Korean tv-Serie which was a great and memorable crime drama.It's about a prosecutor and a policewoman who work together to bring the truth of those with wealth and power into the light.The script was well written. The cast is very good. The emotionless main character was performed by Cho Seung-Woo as a prosecutor who is a very talented actor. Doona Bae suits her role perfect as a policewomen.", "My family are viewers, not a reviewers. Here is our no-spoiler take of \"Bimilui Soop\" (Forest of Secrets):As viewers who enjoy the occasional k-drama, but not 'fans' of the genre, we understood Forest of Secrets had to survive in the \"k-drama\" market. Standard market treatment to avoid alienating the domestic viewer; the standard k-drama outro sting, 16-episode 'season' container, and a few 'over the top' cartoon characters are glaring examples. With that in mind we found the story treatment very good. There was about 3 episodes of eye-crossing back-and-forth shot in offices and 2 episodes of arcs with too much focus for our taste; maybe to make a 'season.' In total, there was around 2 total composite hours where the story felt like it was dragging. These were choices that might not have been made in this manner if a story of this caliber was told in the West, but again, might be market appropriate. Even the stereotypical cartoon characters were made interesting by the writers, actors and director. As a personal note: Koreans seem to communicate with less 'hand-holding,' making the translated captions a fast read. Something might be lost in the attempt to capture nuance in captions that only stay on the screen for 3~4 seconds.My family are tough raters and we still thought \"Bimilui Soop\" earned between a 7 and 8 for story and 6-7 for shooting. We loved the treatment at the end of the arc, interesting in how it diverted from the expected ending. We'll round up in consideration of rating inflation.", "Loved every episode and it is very well written. Looked forward to each episode. I do hope Netflix pick up the second season as I am waiting.", "I am new to KDramas thanks to Netflix and am thrilled with the quality of (some) of them. I watched this because I was impressed with Seung-woo Cho in Life (Laipeau), where he (along with Lee Dong Wook and everyone else) was superb. I also know Doona Bae from Sense8. Its an excellent series, complex and gripping, and full of twists and turns which keep things interesting. The two leads work really well together, her warmth and humanity versus his aloofness. Brilliant characterisations and the same excellent acting I am beginning to see across many Kdramas ( in truth, the same actors too, as there seems to be a pool of actors reused across many series! - and why not, they are great). Nail-biting finish, which is an achievement after 16 long episodes. If you like serious intelligent crime series with good detective work and no silliness (which Kdramas tend towards), then this is for you. And theres lovely subtle humour too, stemming from the interaction between the two leads, who couldn't be more different.", "It chronicles the journey of a prosecutor without empathy and not much liked in his department along with an emotional female police officer in solving a murder case which involves taking on the corrupt system and their own corrupt departments.It is so well written that it makes us doubt every one at one point of time or other so much that i had doubts even about the lead actor-Hwang Shi Mok at few occasions . This, i think is the biggest plus point for any suspense series or movie. The background music completely suits and lifts the series at important junctions which again plays an important role in any thriller. Last few episodes makes you emotional as well despite at initial stages(episodes) it seemed that there wont be much emotional connect.This is my First Korean drama ,and though i had little difficulty in remembering names when i started but its so well paced with characters coming in at just perfect time that the characters and the story keep seeping in very well. Though as i said it makes us doubt almost every character but my gut feeling about 2 important events or happenings that take place in last few episodes was bang on . Suspense is actually good but what i liked the most is the flow of story and how events unfolds that keeps us hooked.Performance from everyone was really good and i mean everyone . My favorites are Hwang Shi-Mok(played by Seung-woo Cho) and Lee Chang-Joon (played by Jae-myung Yoo).I am neither a K drama addict nor TV series addict but more of a movie lover but still it kept me hooked . This was recommended by a good friend of mine and i would recommend it to anyone who loves watching stories that are riveting thrilling and sucks one in . Its a MUST WATCH TV series", "A deeply layered crime procedural in the K-drama style. Hwang Shi-mok is a brilliant but emotionally crippled prosecutor in the Western Seoul District. A gangster is murdered then the trail starts to lead to joy girls and higher ups, maybe his boss, co-workers, the cops, government officials? Everyone has a story or two and could be a suspect, slowly, too slowly but K-Drama right? the evidence is uncovered, corruption goes high. Some twists and turns, a cliffhager of sorts each episode; a lot of short convos in office settings, similar to the Joseon era costume dramas. Similar to the palace roman-a-clefs these stories need a schemer; full of furtive looks, quick excuses and plotting. Joon-hyeok Lee gets the thankless task here as Seo Dong-Jae; his character becomes more than wearisome by Ep 8, all \"drats foiled again\" facial tics. The rest are fine pros also, Seung-woo Cho as the lead has to play it straight, Doona Bae is a perky cop.", "I really enjoyed this series. The characters brought it alive. This is something I am hoping gets a second season as I was left wanting more I need to know where he goes from now.", "Everything about this was great: the acting, screenplay, writing.\nNothing has gripped me as much as this. There wasn't a single dull moment that made me feel bored. The show would always make you doubt every person. It would make you think, \"maybe it's this person instead of this person?\" Then you'd suddenly change your mind after a scene, becoming sceptical of everyone.Hwang Shi-Mok (Seung-woo Cho) was great. He executed his role amazingly.\nAs well as Han Yeo-Jin (Donna Bae).I feel that keeping romance away from this show was a good course of action. Romance can become annoying in shows, especially if it isn't the main focus. It ruins it all an all. (At least to me anyway)Conclusion:\nGood lengthy drama to watch over the course of a couple weeks. Highly recommend to anyone who is new in the Korean drama crime show scene.\nYou're sure to have a jolly good time watching this.", "I think I have a pretty healthy detachment from the fiction I enjoy, but now that I've watched all 16 hours of \"Stranger,\" I'm experiencing separation depression! This tightly constructed drama was so much better than any of the usual American police procedurals, that I couldn't stop watching. Doona Bae's Lieutenant Han is a model of the wise woman professional in a career dominated by knuckleheaded males, but not so cliche since many of the male characters were portrayed as comfortable with her authority and respectful of her superior sleuthing. Seung-Woo Cho's junior prosecutor has a fascinating mental quirk that Cho plays with subtlety. You can't help but sympathize with him even when he's at his least empathetic. The unbelievable becomes believable as the motives and methods behind the crimes are revealed, and the overarching theme of pervasive corruption in democratic capitalist society is relatable to an American audience. It's going to be a while before I get over the end of this series, but there was a suggestion in episode 15 of Seung-Woo Cho's character getting a 10-month assignment in the USA, travelling from state to state. That's a series I really want to see, provided the writers of Stranger make the trip with him.", "The thickness of the plot and the fullness of the characters are impressive. In the plot, the murder case is the beginning, actually speaking of the secular, is the collusion between the government and the businessmen. Get rid of the sensation and love that make people drowsy, very refined. In characters, the main characters all have background, desire, motivation, and each action can make people feel reasonable. Dialogue, every sentence seems to have been deliberated, especially a few rival plays, dialogue makes people think deeply ah, kill the murderer in the middle of the night.", "This is a great tv show. If you like Korean drama then this will be a great one to watch .", "Fundamentally a legal thriller driven by deductive reasoning style of investigation and well placed surprising plot twists with sporadic emotions.\nThe show starts off in a little convoluted manner where you find it difficult to establish the relationships between characters and their motives. But as it progresses the thrill of investigation keeps the viewer hooked in and demands your attention to decipher the aforementioned problem.It deals with backstabs and betrayals throughout the first half of the show so that you are unable to trust most of the characters. Then it settles down and moves towards revealing all the mysteries.Even though it has a social message in the end, it doesnt preach you but rather warns (this is especially relevant for the local South Korean audience) about the danger.The acting of the whole cast is top notch. It actually elevates the writing.\nMusic does its job creating the environment for a thriller.The drawback is that it remains subtle in its revelation of twists and answers to some questions throughout the show which may warrant a second time viewing and it probably will irk some of the viewers.\nDiscalaimer: If you are new to Korean dramas, there are some antics and reactions by the actors which may seem over the top and unnecessary but it is a cultural aspect and it should not be considered as a flaw."], "676": [], "677": ["King's Daughter, Soo Baek Hyang is one of the most entertaining dramas I have seen in a long time. It could it even be used as a framework for how to create an entertaining drama. It has great acting, great pacing, great writing, great chemistry between actors and great costumes. Even though King's Daughter, Soo Baek Hyang did not have the most ravish sets nor a high budget-it was able to do more than most fancy sageuks have done in the past. I was most impressed with the acting in this drama. It was well cast with some veteran sageuk actors and newcomers to the genre. The lead actress Hyeon-jin Seo and actress Woo Seo were spectacular and nuanced in their performance. The most soulful performances were by the veteran actors Jae-ryong Lee as King Moo Ryung and Tae-young Yoon as Koo-Chun. King's Daughter, Soo Baek Hyang had great pacing. The episodes were about 30 minutes each. The story did not drag on as some other dramas of this genre-the wars were short and the torture scenes were brief. The light comedic scenes also made the show very enjoyable to watch. A viewer would never become bored if other dramas of this genre added some light comedy as well.Great writing was also very much present in King's Daughter, Soo Baek Hyang. It used many literary foils effectively. It's quite obvious that kind-hearted Seol-Nan is the protagonist and her sister Seol-Hee is the evil foil. As for the two princes who were switched, here is the other obvious literary foil. The upright yet dashing Prince Myung Nong's foil is Prince Jin-Moo who is charming but devilish. Great chemistry between Seol-Nan and Myung Nong was another bonus to this drama. They had one of the best romances in Korean dramas. Scenes between Seol-Nan and Myung Nong were funny, sweet and sad at the same time. Koo-Chun's love for Chae-Hwa was also very tender and heartfelt.", "Where we are taken in a journey over an old story of Korea,were we can find how tricky's a person sometimes,how tricky is his knowledge, how can be someone a fool in his conviction;so many pains resulting.Luckily in plot we have Solnan,this kind of girl by a beloved naivety,she's royal bone but she will doesn't know along dozen of episodes.Near her is her half-sister Solhia,an devilish,exasperating person who's struggles for status;but on screen she is a terrible actress, she performs extraordinary. I love the character Solnan exactly for her charming naivety and gentle demeanor.She can make you pull the hair for all her credulousness,later all turns in great scenes of retrievals and encounters.She will make you cry at that episode when she'll discover the buried secret of her mother;she will make you laugh,truly,at point that appear in disguise;will delight you with pleasant night scenes at her innocent love meetings with Myungnang. I love many characters of this drama: Doltae for jokes,Muryeong's gently warm,teacher's Dorim gentle wisdom,funnily Queen,sadly Kochon,trustworthy MyungNang and pitied Jinmu,eunuch's Jung amazing kind.... Perfect timed great music at particular scenes.Never bored to see especially Solnan playing her role in specific episodes;her saga provoked me to appreciate the marvelous MBC's studios via internet.", "I watched it because I had nothing else to watch. I'm a big fan of historical Korean drama. Well, first of all, it is so sad you'll cry a river. It contains tragic love story that'll make you cry so hard. The power of this drama is not in the plot twist, but in how long the secrets will be unveiled. As a watcher, we know all the secrets but we are dying to know how much longer will everything revealed. That's the climax. At first, the plot is going a little bit slow but still enjoyable. Try to enjoy it as much as you can until you can do nothing but to skip some parts just to see how and when the secrets are revealed. I hate Seolhee so much that I need to skip most of her parts when Seolnan is not there. I don't think her part bring any importance to the plot either. She's just an evil and selfish girl who think of nothing but herself. I've never hated someone so much before. They are success in making someone looks so bad if the character were alive we could kill her.I couldn't wait any longer to find out how the king would know Seolnan is her daughter so I must skip lots and lots of part in the last episodes. I was disappointed because the king found his real daughter when he's going to die and he did nothing much for her, like, Su Baek-hyang has done A LOT for the country, even to the extent of risking her life. And it doesn't seem so rewarding. The end is not satisfying too. Seolnan made a perfect material to become the queen of Baekje but in the end, she doesn't even marry the crown prince. Even though they're allowed to. So... for me, personally it's enjoyable in the beginning toward the end, but you'll rush the episodes because you REALLY want to see how everything's revealed and how the bad guys ruined themselves. That's all, thank you for reading this."], "678": [], "679": [], "680": ["Secret Garden is a 20 episode Korean TV show that aired from 2010-2011. It's another poor girl meets rich boy Korean melodrama. Korean television will tell this same story over and over again until the end of time, and, lord knows I've seen a crap ton of these shows to say the least. Summary Verdict: this one's not bad.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Ha Ji-won plays Gil Ra-im; a poor & humble stunt woman trying to make ends meet working in the movie industry. Hyun Bin plays Kim Joo-won; a wealthy & arrogant heir to an upscale department store chain. Joo-won mistakes Ra-im as an actress his famous brother once dated, and as a result, they subsequently meet & spend some time together by accident. Need I even bother expounding?...comedy, romance, drama ensue. You know the format: she's the pretty but tough tomboyish type with no time for nonsense in her life, he's the straight laced rich guy who works hard but has plenty of time for whatever nonsense he wishes. The two meet and he begins to soon fall for her. She's less than impressed with him though, so he's got his work cut out for him. The tried and true staple of K-drama loves stories is on full display here; he's constantly presented with a series of arranged dates to meet a future wife from the same ilk as his own family, but he's not interested in this and wants to find his own love. His stature and eligibility means he pursued by an endless supply of suitable beauties, so his ego is a bit unchecked in regards to what a great catch he thinks he is. As such, he is somewhat baffled by the fact that this \"lower class\" girl doesn't jump at the chance to be with him, couldn't care less about his standing, and won't give him the time of day. He's also never met any woman quite like this before in his life, and she's pretty easy to look at, so he's more than intrigued/smitten/determined/etc. He therefore decides to use his power and wealth to intrude in her life in order to win her over, which initially backfires of course, until perhaps the 2 can eventually find some common ground to stand on if this relationship was \"meant to be\".We're rolling right along with the standard fare for this genre over the first half dozen episodes or so; it's workable and kept fairly tight for the most part as the two leads come together bit by bit. It's all pretty much par for the course, then, BAM (SPOILERS); on a mountain biking date one day, the 2 stray off course and stumble upon a strange old shop & restaurant in the middle of nowhere. While there, they imbibe a magical potion which causes their souls to switch bodies. As such, a whole new layer to the proceedings then comes into play in this series.While this wacky \"out of nowhere\" plot aspect of the show may seem absurd (and it is, of course), it does actually work, and, it works quite well. It both helps to break up the status quo for a typical K-drama, and, also serves to further benefit the story as well as a whole. These two characters were having a hard time developing a common ground & relationship the old fashioned way, so perhaps they will find love via this mystical method instead. Accordingly, the two opposites come to understand and appreciate each other more by spending time in each other's body/life.The twist provides for a great deal of comedy to be mined here, as the CEO dude now has to lead the life of the poor tough girl, and stunt woman girl has to run a company and be subjected to high society pressures. While they've switched bodies, they also each take the opportunity to investigate the other, turn away the other's potential love interests, see each other's friends and siblings half naked, etc. It's all pretty cute. This is not without problems though, as each time it rains, the bodies are switched back and forth; so, there's a chance he might get caught in her body while trying to perform a risky stunt that he's ill prepared for, or she does something unknowingly that puts him in danger due to his health problems, etc.Eventually, the two leads get down to the business of trying to figure out how to stop switching bodies all the time, so they can get back to their normal lives before somebody finds out or something goes horribly wrong. With some help from their friends and family, and with a little luck, perhaps all will work out in the end, and maybe the two leads will be able to find love along the way. The cast all put in acceptable to solid work, and just about all characters are likable enough. Perhaps the best role is that of the CEO's brother; a K-pop star known as Oska, who leads a mostly carefree life of luxury when he's not lamenting the loss of his true love that got away. The stunt woman has a huge fan crush on him that comically belies her no nonsense tough girl persona, to the point of her being elated with scoring concert tickets, sleeping in Oska themed socks, etc. And, though Oska competes with his brother to some degree, he mostly serves as an intermediary for the two leads while they work on their budding romance.All in all, this show is pretty solid. It doesn't go on forever (though it could have been trimmed a little), and it's kept pretty lighthearted for the most part; it's mostly a charming comedy-romance-drama, with little heavy handed \"evil plot/villain schemes\". Be prepared for a melodramatic final act though, as this is Korean melodrama after all.Bottom Line: 7-8 out of 10 stars. I'll give it an 8!", "I am so happy to come across this show. I was so bored of sex, violence and drama and then, I found Secret Garden. This show gives you love in its purest form as possible. When I watch it, I can feel butterflies flying in my stomach one minute , then the tears roll down on my cheeks and a broad smile occupy my face at the end of each show. Characters are well put, funny and deep. You can feel and understand what they are going through. Story line is enhanced with side stories and never boring. The cinematography is breath taking, like most of far eastern movies the scenery brings forth the emotions. To sum up, please give this show a try, I am sure you ll be hooked :)", "I really didn't think I would like this drama. I watched Boys Over Flowers and ended up really disliking the whole series because I couldn't get over how unlikeable some of the characters were. When I started Secret Garden, I thought \"Oh great another story about a bratty rich guy who traumatizes his girlfriend into liking him... I bet the female lead looks like she's strong and then becomes a blubbering wimp or insensitive ice queen.\" I could have not been MORE WRONG. OK some may watch episode one and say...well sure looks like it to me! ...but it's not. This is how BoF should have tackled the rich boy/poor girl love story.OK to be fair I was not a big Joo Won fan for most of the series (His character alone made me question the series as a whole). Surprisingly the one who enchanted me was Gil Ra Im, and the adorable Oska! <3 I stuck with the series because it was refreshing to see the leading lady bite back when Joo Won was being a jerk. When he hurt her she would tell him, and she never gave in to his sharp remarks, and eventually Joo Won realized the power of his own words and slowly opened himself to loving her. When you fall in love and root for a character you once disliked, that's the power of great story telling. What is more amazing about this drama, even though it followed some typical Kdrama conventions it did so in a way that you were surprised and shocked that they worked in some big revelations. It brought out the true meaning of 'destiny' and it made the series as a whole more heartfelt and touching.The switching bodies theme...I thought \"eeeeeeh this will be needless and over the top\" but it was really well done! At first it took some getting used to, but it actually made for some of the more touching moments in the story, and the funniest. Joo Won swooning over Oska made me laugh to tears. Lastly, I find one of the biggest faults with many dramas is the story always feels like it tapered off without thought at the very end. I loved that Secret Garden tied up all the loose ends in the most touching of ways. It felt complete to me, and it made me feel like the love experienced in the stories was true and sincere.Overall, those of you who watch the first couple of episodes and are not impressed, I say stick with it! You'll be glad you did. All the characters are wonderful to watch and develop into three-dimensional people that you'll root for and cheer on! It's a fantastic love story that makes you want to find your soulmate. :D", "Every time I watch a show from Korea, I am never disappointed. This one is no different. An emotional roller coaster show with fantastic characters, beautiful cinematography and amazing soundtrack. You will fall in love with the show and its characters. The script is well written and the actors and actresses have such chemistry.You will find yourself laughing, crying, smiling and being angry right along with them.A word of caution though. You will find yourself wanting to start the next episode once you reach the end of the one you are watching because it is that good and addicting. I was sad that I got to the last episode and it ended. So, I started watching from the first episode again. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.", "The title head pretty much described it all, with such unique story line of modern fairy tale and the harsh reality, it was sure hardcore for everyone who watched the whole series. They have deviated from the usual KDrama style, plot and conflicts. It is fantasy by the way, but the great thing is that it was not greatly emphasized in the early episodes (the switching part). They did not spend most of the time in different bodies, in contrast to what others would have expected. Sure it was fun to watch the actors played so well but in the latter part it played a big role in story development and made the story what it is: destiny, love, magic and everything else in between.More on the deviating from usual KDrama trend, let's go to love triangles. Pretty much empty, for the first part again I expected Oska and Yoon Seul to be big third parties in the rel. of the main characters (just like in Full House) but again wasn't interesting anymore. Another thing is the conflict between Joo Won's mother. I thought it would be another main conflict but the theme of the story prevailed : Love conquers all! I would also like to commend the writer for such great plot. I love that she did not revealed everything in the first parts, opposed to many KDramas that tells the social status of both protagonists, family background and conflicts at the start of the story. If it had been like that, it would not make the story interesting (I was really guessing what could have happened to Ra Im's father, or Joo Won's life-changing accident, nor how the Oska-Yoon Seul bitterly ended) .It was obviously not a character-driven plot, it was more on what's going to happen to Gil Ra Im and Joo Won next that would help clarify the past.There were many metaphors, symbols and recurring themes (eg little mermaid) and if you had not appreciated this series, I say you missed it. Clearly, it was a work of a genius to think of such great script and plot.Another common mistakes of Kdramas is that you would end up loving the actors because of empty reasons. Secret Garden got me so hooked up to Gil Ra Im and Joo Won that i did not bother searching their names in Google when i was watching the series (I only did that after finishing the series). Their undeniable chemistry would sure fire up the intensity of the key plots, making them effective actors. BOTTOMLINE: I fell in love with the characters! Not with the actors !The ending was absolutely perfect. It wasn't a fairy tale like ending. Ra Im did not turn into Cinderella, nor Joo Won into Prince Charming. In the end, it was their love that prevailed amidst imperfections in their relationship and differences. Finishing the story with the lines, \"We still don't have a single wedding picture, but we fall in love every single day, like living a magical life\". That's what I true magic brings into our lives: blissful love beyond imperfectionsThe story itself was well-written, plot was well-thought, the casting and the chemistry of the actors have pretty much set the tone for the success of the series. This may sound biased but overall i say this is the BEST KOREAN Drama i have seen in years, and I would be sure there won't be any KDRAMAS that will be as good as this in the coming years.", "I much enjoy a romantic melodrama in the min-series format that develops a main single story from beginning to end, though with some related parallel sub-plots along the way. The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back. This may recur in the same story.Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved.If personality dynamics are properly depicted in a valid manner, and if the production is skillful, powerful emotions can be evoked in the viewer. In this way we can live many lifetimes through movies, in our one lifetime - greatly enriching our incarnate experience.These South Korean productions (seen on Netflix streaming) are first class with excellent production and direction, some terrific casting and acting (particularly from some of the females who give some matchless world class performances), brilliant musical accompaniment, and staging. What makes these so good is the way they skillfully evoke deep emotion in the viewer. South Korean movie making is superb - world class.However, the following caveats must be considered by the USA viewer: They are subtitled and some people hate this. The South Korean cultural norms, values and sanctions may sometimes seems silly or old fashioned to the USA viewer. The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation/unity - sometimes reminiscence of a old Frank Capra film.Most importantly, in order for the sometimes complicated sub-plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing, and this leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people, that sometimes seem to be unlikely by USA cultural standards. The viewer may wonder at times why good but trusting people are so easily manipulated and deceived by bad and selfish people, but con artists do often succeed (just look at politicians for example). However this poetic license of improbability is needed to develop the story - just accept it as occurring even though unlikely at times. Taking these factors into account will help you become involved and emotionally engrossed. It was hard for me to quit watching at times so I often binged watched more than one episode at a time.I would rank these as follows but tastes differ and your rankings might not agree: 1 - 4 (hard to say which is best)Shining InheritanceWhen a Man LovesThat Winter, The Wind BlowsSecret garden5.

The Great DoctorSecret Garden is a romantic comedy as well as melodrama, and interplays the two quite well. We see a transformation in the male lead from a rich, self-centered upper-class snob, unable to love others, into a regular guy ('human' as the South Koreans label it) able to relate emphatically and love. The female lead puts the snob down, even beating him up when he deserves it, which makes for great fun. This theme is also featured in \"Protect the Boss\", another South Korean TV mini-series that is not reviewed by me.", "Secret Garden is delightful with two of Korea's best actors and two of the best writers and directors. It hits all major points in KDrama romance and fantasy but also carries a strong theme about the power of unconditional love. My only quibble is the evil mother figure that becomes a staple in Korean drama. Really tired of it. But everything else I love and have watched the series over through the years-which I never do with American series. Nine years later, I still don't think Hyun Bin has matched that performance. Strongly recommended.", "Very funny, very touching. For the most part, a wonderful screenplay. The chemistry was good between the two leads. Bit then I often find that in these dramas. It had cliches common to korean dramas. But I tend to overlook those. The two leads gave good performances, but there were no real standouts. It made me laugh, smile, cry.", "I'm from the UK so didn't get to see this on Netflix until last year but having enjoyed watching I've just watched again. Love the action and humour between the characters and also the opportunity of viewing Korean culture and scenery. The only criticism I have now watching it the second time around is for me, a bit of chemistry lacking between male and female leads, otherwise, very well acted", "The more familiar you are with Korean/Eastern Asian way of life, the more treasures you find in this drama. Although at first, magic sounds ridiculous as a way to rationalize a Cinderella type story, but in the end that magic does prove to work well in context and make the whole story more logical.Other aspects are good/excellent. However, only 9/10 from me because some parts can still be cut short.", "If you foreign watchers do not know, secret garden is regarded as the classic of romantic drama in korea. This is true also in my place. I agree with one of the commentary here that it has some elements that are different from typical love kdrama, then in turn let secret garden excels other kdramas.The plot is well written. Female lead is a stuntwoman. Scenes of her fighting in movie shooting making her a very special lead. The story ends with the lead couple actually meet each other when young, with Ha's father, a fireman, dead because of saving the life of the young male lead. So, the lead couple meet not just by coincidence but by destiny. This makes the story ends so perfectly.The other thing impress me is the big house of the male lead, beautifully decorated with a large garden that has pond, forest and snowy ground. It is just like a paradise. In fact the house is used in a recent kdrama.It is a seriously made classic that you cannot miss.", "I watched it on 2018 . I can't step out of the fantasy. Its like these characters are real. The story is not only about the eternal love between two persons with huge differences but it also gives the message that fate can change everything. The actors were outstanding. The body swap didn't impress me but the acting made it even. The climax is the most heartouching. The BGM played a major role in empathising with the characters.", "Unexpectedly, Secret Garden is quite entertaining. Sure, the story and the romance wasn't the best of the best, and the performances were so so, but still I can understand why this drama is so popular. First of all, the drama is about a rich, cynical CEO who meets a poor stand woman who gets his interest. Their lives get even more complicated, when they magically change bodies. Oaky, the magic part wasn't that good. It was a little childish at first, but it had a not-that-great explanation in the end. And the body exchange was very entertaining the first time, but the second time was just uncomfortable. The main male character was very funny, due to his character, and in the end, that was the only thing supporting the drama. For me, the twenty episodes were a bit too much; the story could have easily finish at the sixteenth or the eighteenth episode, and still, it would have been as good, as the final episode was a quick wrap up mixed up with a few concert songs, some flash backs and family life moments. So, 6 out of 10.", "SPOILERS !!! 1- It's not funny, I hardly ever laughed. Part of it could be poor subtitles, but you don't need those for physical comedy, and there's precious little of that.2- The main premise of the body swap, which offered unlimited possibilities, is terribly underutilized.3- Characters do not behave in a realistic way, for example we are asked to believe that while swapped they aren't curious about their new bodies. Also why pretend they don't feel any kind of sexual impulse? If the creators didn't want them to have sex before marriage they could have found some perfectly good excuse.4- How and why the female lead, from the original distaste for him, comes to love the male lead, is poorly explained, we are left to assume she gets tired of him insisting so much and gives in.5- The story arc of the sidekick couple, even in its simplicity, is a lot more interesting than the protagonists' one.6- While the bodies are swapped they are sometimes showed as un-swapped (for the viewer benefit I guess?) but this only causes confusion and negates the premise.7- The main actress shows good acting skills when she does a man in a woman's body, but below average ones otherwise.8- The two most important conflicts (the difficult love stories of the two couples) are resolved too soon, so the final episode lacks any punch and is reduced to some 50 minutes of happy ending, which is way too many.9- The evil mother thing is overdone.10- The sister of the main character is first introduced and then completely forgotten about.11- Other characters which either had the potential for an interesting sub-plot (the gay musician) or were genuinely funny (the assistant of the department store director Park) were underdeveloped/underutilized.12- To an extent this is to be expected in most TV shows, but when it comes to Secret Garden there are way too many plot holes and inconsistencies.13- For a series produced in 2010, there are too many K-drama stereotypes: rich boy/poor girl, evil mother, sidekick couple, hospital\u0085 we've seen this for a decade now. Still it would be OK if at least it was well done, but it isn't.The series by which I jusge all others is \"Kim Sam-soon\" which, with all the limitations inherent to a family TV program / k drama, is funny, realistic enough, not too syrupy, and sports the best female lead character in the history of television.That show set the standard for rom-coms, and therefore we can expect it to be copied a lot, but Secret Garden went to far: - same actor in the male lead role - in both shows there's a trip to Jeju island - in both shows the male lead had a life threatening accident when younger - said accident left the male lead unable to ride a transport (car/elevator)", "This drama indeed is depicting a different male main character of the usual Korean drama, on this drama Hyun Bin acting cold-hearted, speak straight forwardly but also arrogant and loving at the same time. Ha Ji Won acting as a rather weak female character who pretended to be strong but needed to be loved and taking care of. These 2 characters across their paths and with quite boring some arguments they managed to fall in love and charmed by each other. Don't really get into this drama at 1st but the funniest part is when at 1st they changed souls into their bodies, the 2nd one is predictable of how the story goes on, 3rd one rather sad and I almost cried of how sad it could be. Overall it's a happy ending but without the approval of Hyun Bin's mom and she's being stubborn and hateful till the end. The soundtrack is nice an enjoyable. I don't quite say that it's a good drama, but this one is not bad to killing time. The acting of both the main actors are not that great and quite ordinary may be they could put more effort to bring different characters.", "I waited for the series to end in GMA 7 before making this review. I watched the original Korean series with English subtitle but I didn't enjoy it. I don't know if it was the actor's or actress's voice or the subtitle but I really didn't find the series appealing. So when I saw the teaser from GMA 7 a few months back, I decided to give it another try. I watched Hyun Bin from the series My Name is Kim Sam Soon and I love him ever since. That's why watching it twice was not a bad idea.I wasn't disappointed. I liked the way the Filipinos dubbed the series. The \"kalye\" language they used was very appropriate for our culture and made the series more natural. I definitely love the \"saltik\" term Jamie used to call Owen. It became an endearment. (How was that possible? You should watch the tagalized series.)Secret Garden was one of the most popular drama series to hit mainstream Korea. It has high ratings and continued to be on top of the charts till the last episode. I won't argue with that. It was really funny. I understand why the Koreans loved it because after watching the tagalized version, I fell in love with it too. I thought that the series was like a Korean remake of the movie It's a Boy Girl Thing (2006). I'm not saying it was the same but I think the concept was derived from this movie. The Koreans just expanded the concept and made the story suitable for Asian audiences.Hyun Bin's portrayal of Owen's character was very smooth but I was more amazed with Hyun Bin's acting when the swapping of bodies occurred. He has to act as Jamie and that basically requires him to act like a girl\u2014 he was very effective. The change in characters was drastic but Hyun Bin pulled it off. It was not awkward. The acting was very natural. And as a viewer, I believed that Jamie's soul was in Owen's body.On the other hand, Hai Ji Won's acting may not be impressive but she improved very well since she started in the business. I first had a glimpse of her acting prowess in the movie 100 Days with Mr. Arrogant and she was not good. I found her acting in that movie very novice but that would be in another review. I don't think there's much difference from her Jamie-self and Owen-acting when the switched occurred. She already has as strong, tomboyish character at the beginning of the series, so I didn't find it exceptional.The series in general was slow-paced. I understand that they wanted to build the characters in the first ten episodes to make the viewers acquainted with their attitudes so by the time the swap happens, the viewers will easily see the changes. However, I was bored to death waiting for the swap to happen. This was supposedly the core of the series. Why haven't they shown it yet? When it finally did, instead of feeling ecstatic, I was relieved. At long last, the moment I've been waiting for took place.Hey, wait up! It's not all negative. There are a couple of things I love from the series.First, Owen's trademark track suit. That sequenced blue track suit was probably the most popular item ever copied and mass-produced in Korea. It looks funny in Owen but it looks adorable in Hyun Bin. (The analogy is difficult to explain. Ha-ha)Second, the unexpected kiss between Owen (with Jamie's soul) and his cousin Oska (Yoon Sang Hyun). I find that scene remarkable! I can't forget it. I know Hyun Bin was acting Jamie's character but still in reality he is who he is and Oksa is Yoon Sang Hyun and they shared a kiss?! I can't take that off my mind for a few days.And last of all, Owen's attitude with love. If there's a guy out there like him, pwede akin ka na lang? (Can you please be mine?) He fought for what he wanted. He didn't give up on love. Even if Jamie threw him out, physically and emotionally hurt him\u2014he stayed. He showed the cold, afraid and aloof Jamie what it means to love and be loved."], "681": ["The Suspicious Housekeeper/Strange Housekeeper is a 20 episode Korean TV Drama from late 2013.SPOILERS AHEAD!This is somewhat of an odd show for Korean television; it's a very disjointed mix of family values and adult themes, with a murderous secret back story thrown in. In many ways, it often feels much more like a Japanese life lessons drama for teens, or an older American type after school special, than it does a modern Korean melodrama (except, it goes on a crazy revenge tale bender for a while in the middle of things).Here's your story: Choi Ji Woo stars as the titular character, and she is one strange housekeeper to say the least. She's hired by a recently widowed husband with a family of 4 young kids to be maid/nanny/cook of the household. The Housekeeper is essentially a mirror image of Mary Poppins; she can do everything and anything and even comes with a magic bag from which to pull whatever is needed for any given circumstance. She's also very precise, never smiles, and is completely devoid of emotion. As such, at first blush, it would almost appear she must be some type of sentient android or ghostly reincarnation or what have you.After a rocky start between them, the kids eventually take a cautious liking to their new housekeeper while their dad is busy trying to get his sh*t together; the dad is primarily portrayed as a cowardly man & absentee father for much of the early part of this show. Thus, the kids start to rely on the housekeeper more and more, and since she obeys EVERY order requested of her, they quickly find she can be quite useful. Being kids though, they frequently make some awfully rash requests that entail killing, sex, &/or general mayhem. SPOILERS NOTE: there is no actual killing or sex involved, since the kids come to their senses &/or chicken out before any real damage can be done.Over time, the housekeeper helps the kids learn & heal & grow via some often unconventional methods; the kids then slowly come to think of her as more of a mom than a housekeeper, and they eventually want her to join their family to replace the mom they just lost. First though, they need to figure out what happened in her past to make her so emotionless and help her become more a loving human being once again. Along about this time, a maniacal businessman is introduced into the story; the housekeeper is convinced this is the person responsible for ruining her life, and she sets out to make him pay for his perceived sins. This amounts to a very strange interlude to the tone of the original story, but it nevertheless serves as the means to uncovering the housekeeper's history and having her heal her own past wounds.That's basically it. Otherwise, it's just a matter of following along to see if kids & dad can grow closer and move on with life, see if housekeeper can resolve her past & present issues with the mysterious businessman (if she doesn't outright kill him), and to see if housekeeper is willing & ready to become part of a new family.Choi Ji Woo is rather good as the housekeeper, but this is such an unusual role; she's afforded few opportunities to break from her rigid character, though she is quite effective while acting within it. Lee Sung Jae adequately portrays the flawed man that tries to become a better dad & person over time. The businessman guy and love interest girl do their jobs well enough. There are a couple of other side characters as well: the clutzy aunt, the father in law & the housekeeper agency boss with their own relationship,and some neighbors, that are primarily on hand for some filler and buffoonery. Then, there are the kids, and, well, Yikes!The kids are focused on considerably throughout (particularly the 2 girls); each of the kids get their own story line, and the eldest daughter gets her own recurring sub story as a member of the lamest group in the history of KPop. The purpose of this story line isn't really focused on their music, but they are laughably bad performers nonetheless; however, the young actress that played this role did give a very nice performance overall throughout this show. The rest of the kids get progressively younger though, and they often have some difficulty handling the subject material in a satisfactory manner. I'm not going to sit here and bash a bunch of child actors/actresses, but it's awfully hard to expect what looks like a 5 year old girl to keep up with the manic shooting pace of a KTV drama, let alone sufficiently pretend to comprehend and deal with her mom's suicide, a crappy dad, and all the other adult themes swirling around her; this poor little girl can barely even read her lines, yet she's practically THE central figure in trying to build a familial relationship with the robotic housekeeper, and this obviously creates some considerable problems during some of the more dramatic scenes involving the two of them.All in all, I didn't think this show was all that great, though it does have its moments here and there. It's such an unusual mix of flavors, tones, & story that I'm not even sure who the target audience for this thing is supposed to be; it's often too mature for kids, likely not flashy or sexy enough overall for late teens & young adults to identify with, and, it's somewhat unsuited for more seasoned K-drama viewers looking for a traditional melodrama fix. In addition, I think this probably would have been a far better show if the housekeeper/businessman relationship was completely omitted in lieu of focusing solely on the life lesson/family value/personal healing aspect that serves as its foundation.Bottom Line: 6.5 out of 10 stars.", "Here we have Ji-Woo Choi (Winter Sonata, Stairway To Heaven) giving a MAGNIFICENT performance as an unsmiling housekeeper to a family who just lost their mother to suicide. The children remaining latch on to her, despite her failings, because they are grieving the loss of their mother and dealing with a wimpy father who was having an affair with a co-worker which brings on the wife's suicide. If he had only kept his pants on she never would have died! The children are all great little actors in this show; how Korea keeps finding these incredible child actors I have no idea, but they knock it out of the ballpark compared to child actors from Hollywood, bringing depth to their characters, even the tiny five year old girl who is an absolute treasure of a performer. I am not sure I could even read a script at five years old, much less have the depth to bring dramatic emotions to the surface.You can watch this show on websites like dramafever.Don't miss this addictive drama, it gets 10 stars from me!"], "682": [], "683": [], "684": [], "685": [], "686": [], "687": [], "688": ["I discovered Korean dramas when I watched City Hunter (2011) on Netflix and quickly became hooked. I've seen over 60 since then and now watch a lot more Korean than American TV shows. The great story-telling and acting make reading subtitles worthwhile. Two Weeks is now my favorite Korean drama because it has everything that makes Korean TV so compelling--high stakes, fascinating characters with interesting arcs, fantastic acting, great pacing, and lots of pretty people.A man living an aimless life one day learns that he has a 7 year old daughter he never knew about. His ex-girlfriend has tracked him down because the little girl has leukemia and desperately needs a bone marrow transplant. When a blood test shows that he can save her life, he suddenly has a purpose for living, but then he is framed for murder because of the way he has been living. He has two weeks to prove his innocence (while being hunted by both the police and a ruthless assassin) so he can save his daughter and redeem his life.All the main actors are talented and good-looking, but Lee Jun Ki is so outstanding, the series is worth watching just for his performance. He became a super star in Asia in 2005 for his performance as the beautiful minstrel (clown) in the record-breaking film \"The King and the Clown.\" Since then he has been (among other types) a playboy, a delinquent, a secret agent, a Robin Hood-type legend, a journalist, and a Josean era magistrate who can see ghosts. Once again LJK is playing a role completely different from any of his previous roles and creating an unforgettable character.The Koreans like to give acting awards for Best Couple each year. There are plenty of great relationships in this story, but I wouldn't be surprised if this year saw the first Best Couple award for a father/daughter relationship for LJK and the adorable little girl who plays his daughter. For all the great action and suspense, their relationship is the real heart of this story.", "Not to be missed, folks! This is so much better than about 3/4's of all the K-dramas I have watched so far, equaling 136 at last count. Jun Ki Lee leaves his pretty boy looks behind him after his military service to get into a modern story of a man who changes dramatically when he discovers he has a biological daughter he's never known about before, and that she is sick and that without his help she will die.I love the way Koreans have their characters grow and change and reform for the better. Petty gangsters become decent human beings. Fast women reform and become noble. It's very inspirational and you rarely see that king of process on American shows.The little actress who played his daughter was so adorable I wanted to capture her out of the screen and make her my own daughter! She was perfect for Jun Ki Lee. I always say they are the most loving couple in K-drama history!", "If you like watching thriller series, this is perfect for binge watching. You will be glued to the story. If you are someone emotional too, you won't forget it. And if you love kids, you will regret not watching it. If you are new into the korean world coming with the experience of watching high quality British and American tv shows, and that's why afraid ( may be you have looked over the web and have only found out how beautiful ROMANTIC korean dramas are and that unfortunately is not your genre ), don't be because I was once there too not too long ago. This was only my second korean drama.", "Sometimes the preset premise can set a boundary in which creativity is limited. This drama Two Weeks comes close but is able to manoeuvre around just enough to be just good enough.The premise is about harden weakling ex-con criminal who discover himself being a father of an 8 year old girl, and on top, framed for murder, reinvents and rediscovers himself in 2 weeks.The intricacy of the plot involves 2 unlikely scheming selfish villains, a female politician and an mob boss vying for one last big deal. Along with this a prosecutor who has been gathering evidence on these 2; the ex-wife of the ex-con, the current boy friend who is a cop, and the 8 daughter who needs bone-marrow transplant.The 2 weeks, marks off day by day, and the intertwining plot, scenario and relation setup is just complicated enough to build up tension. However, you know the ex-con is not gonna to die, or the seeming dangerous plot points say.. in episode 8 will be escapable. (Since he has to escape until episode 16). But it all works.It works because the villain is despicable, the melodrama is very cheesy. And acting, although not under nor over, fairly even. And th 8 year old girl is so cute.There are better dramas, like Phantom, Sirus. But this is not too shabby."], "689": [], "690": ["Good Doctor; 20 episode KTV drama from the late summer of 2013.SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: An autistic young child named Shi Ohn is orphaned and partially raised by a doctor at an early age. This doctor soon realizes Shi Ohn's autism allows him to absorb and retain all sorts of medical knowledge that a normal person couldn't. Shi Ohn is encouraged to learn and study everything he can until he grows to adulthood, wherein he's given an internship at a children's hospital to see if he can put his extraordinary mind to use in real world practice.Unfortunately, the autism that makes Shi Ohn so knowledgeable in the first place, also makes it difficult for him to communicate with people and grasp the nuances of social interaction in an imperfect society. He can't express his emotions properly, has trouble understanding his own feelings, and can't comprehend why people act and do the things they do (much less understand lies, jokes, ulterior motives, etc). Since he's both incredibly book smart and socially awkward, he's as equally resented as he is feared by his contemporaries; his genius might be able to solve problems they cannot, but he also might do something incredibly stupid that would put lives and careers at risk. Thus, a tentative relationship is born between Shi Ohn and everyone that now surrounds him to see if he can begin to fit in to society and be of help to the hospital and its patients.This is a little bit of an unusual show for a K-drama. It's more of a straight forward drama about the growth of an autistic man, and those around him, more than anything else. It does retain many familiar elements of this genre; there's some melodrama, antagonists, character growth, a little humor, and somewhat of a romantic angle, but if you're looking for some juicy or outrageous or angst ridden makjang drama, this ain't the show for you.Joo Won is the star of the show in his portrayal of Shi Ohn. This could not have been an easy part to play, but Joo Won is up to the task and remarkably believable throughout. He's got all the autistic mannerisms and ticks down pat, but more impressive is the way he's able to convey his emotions in such an effective manner without breaking character. He has to deal with a lot; being bullied, reconciling with his estranged parents, sorting out his first feelings of love, living on his own, making friends, handling disappointment, and overcoming his disability, all while he's trying to prove himself as a capable doctor and basically just get by in life. Joo Won really drives this show with his performance, and the more things progress, the more you can almost sense what he's thinking & feeling without him even uttering a word. Nicely done, Joo Won!Joo Sang Wook & Moon Chae Won fill the other 2 most prominent parts; Joo Sang Wook plays the head doc in charge of the children's ward, and Moon Chae Won plays the prominent young female doc in the wing. Both of them were quite efficient at portraying opposite ends of the spectrum that help Shi Ohn in their own way. He's demanding and won't approve of Shi Ohn until he's satisfied, and she's kindly and supportive of Shi Ohn at almost every turn. The rest of the cast is rounded out by some hospital trustee/upper management types, the kids in the sick ward, and the rest of interns & docs & nurses; they were all effective enough in their roles portraying an antagonist or benefactor or side story character or what have you.Writing, direction, and production were solid. The story is relatively well told, and it does make its way from start to finish rather well without ever getting too bogged down. And, of course, it all looks great on screen; this is modern day HD KTV after all, so that's almost a given with any show that's provided at least a modest budget.If I have any complaints to level against this show, it would be the attempt to (SPOILERS) incorporate a love angle between Moon Chae Won's character and Shi Ohn; this show probably would have better off without that aspect, and, instead just stuck to its overall motif of overcoming adversity and character growth. I suppose I could complain some about some of the annoying young hospital kids, and the standard drive by method of giving short shrift to various medical terms & disorders, but young kids usually can't act very well anyway, and, you can't expect the writers & cast to be experts in the medical field when considering the inherent time constraints involved with airing these shows.Summary: It isn't going to work for everybody, but I must admit that I quite enjoyed this show for the most part. The story is better than decent, there are several good performances (Joo Won, in particular, is outstanding), and, I thought everything was fairly well executed overall. It's ultimately a fairly sweet K-drama tale about a disadvantaged man coping with life, and, the realization that he's not really any better or worse at accomplishing this than any \"normal person\" trying to do the same. I actually found this to be a somewhat unique & rather heartwarming show (and, I'm saying this as a jaded, long-time viewer of KTV melodramas).Bottom Line: Well Recommended! 8 out of 10 stars on the KTV Drama Scale!", "I just came to know about this show from the remake. I must say original one is far far better than the remake. It will make you cry in every episodes and this is one of the best series i have watched so far. This show will definitely teach you very important life lessons and to be a better person, to make a difference surrounding you. 100% would recommend it and i wish there was a second season of this beautiful show. if you didn't watch it yet, please do. you are missing a lot.", "This story is remade in both Japan and the US. I have not finished the Japanese version. But for the Amercian one, the director is the one making the classic Doctor House. The 3D explanation on each medical case is really impressive. The male lead as an autistic doctor is ok.Comparing to the US version, the korean version is not as strong as in explanation of each medical case. The acting of the male lead is ok.I have come accross many autistic children myself. Though I can never imagine an autistic doctor can survive in the hospital in actual life, the plot is creative and a little of exaggeration keeps the drama interesting to follow. That is why the drama is reproduced twice.Watch both version and let see which is better.", "This the second South Korean drama series I've watched and I have to say I loved it. The premise was an interesting one, and I feel the writers, directors and producers did a superb job of bring this to life on screen. Special recognition has to go to the truly superb acting performance of Joo Won. How he kept all of those mannerisms up throughout the series was amazing. Chae-Won Moon also deserves a special mention too. Her interplay with the other characters really helped bring the show alive, and the fact that she lights up the screen whenever she's on it makes it very pleasant watching. I devoured the whole series in less than a month and there wasn't one period during that time when I lost interest. Gripping stuff. Oh, and one more thing. Good Doctor had good positive messages throughout and didn't rely on sex and violence to keep the viewer hooked. Highly recommended and high praise to all involved.", "This version the original version is far better than the US's version. I won't add anything that is a spoiler. The acting is brilliant. The script is amazing.I RECOMMEND WATCHING AT LEAST THE FIRST EPISODE AND DECIDE IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE WATCHING OR NOT.", "Good Doctor deals with an interesting and emotional theme, though the romance kind of ruined it for me.\nMinus:\n-The romance. Why add romance to the story, and not focus on him getting his possition as a surgent? Plus, if he had the mentality of a 10 year old, then the romance was kind of off.\n-They constantly explained that he was cured. Plus, his condition was treated as a disease. Should have been better handled.\n-It dragged at some points and got boring\nPossitives:\n-The cases were interesting\n-The theme and the story was so great and touching\n-There is a happy ending\n-The hospital politics made it more interesting.\n-The acting was great \nSo, overall, 6 out of 10.", "Found this intriguing using the premise of a doctor who is autistic, whether this could happen in reality is debatable. The actor who played the autistic doctor played it quite well with the facial and body movements, as I've met an autistic child with those mannerisms. It's described in this series as a disbility, but in many cases it has been shown that autistic people have an excellent retentive memory. The miss for me was on the romance front, how can the autistic doctor have a love romance with the female doctor, as it clearly states in the storyline that hehas a mind of a 10year old child!! Yes, I could accept that it would be something along the lines of maternal relationship, which, unless I misunderstood, this was suggested by the autistic doctor when he was confused by his feelings. No, very disappointed with the ending, thought the female doctor was better suited to someone like her boss or someone similar."], "691": [], "692": [], "693": [], "694": ["How can a drama this good, end like a dog shI really hate how they handled the ending, like what the actual f was that.

I hesitated to watch at first but it talks about lots of important issues. And i learned a lot while enjoying it. Btw Kim So Hyun's acting skills are really good. She plays two different characters and you can understand who that is just by looking at her looks. I higly recommend it.", "It's the catchy story that will make you watch this drama : a girl takes the place of her privileged twin sister and pretends to be her. Though there is more to this drama than the twin sister story. Sure, it's interesting to see if she will get caught and how she manages to survive in a world that's far from the one she grew up into. But the main interest is the bulling. In this drama, it is handled carefully. showing all the forms that is can take and all its results. And for me, that was the best part of the drama. The love story, actually the love triangle that it develops between the girl, her sister's best friend, and the outcast of her high school, is really good, but it fails to be completed, as the final episode leaves you a little confused.

The romance is cute and all the characters are very entertaining, with strong personalities (even the small side characters manage to be easy to remember). Anyway... because I'm too lazy to write a long review I'm just going to say that I recommend this to those that can get into a pretty long story (the episodes are 1h long and A LOT of things happen all the time) with a bit of interesting debates on ethics (and law).", "I love this drama!

After watching episode 18 learning the true meaning of Hearing people's voice, the feeling I got is something I have never felt before... Once again I have to give it to Korean story. Better than anything i have seen so far. Excellent performance by all the casts specially Lee Bo-Young.

I was simply amazed and kept wanting to watch the next episode, no wonder they added a few episodes after they reached the initial announced number and of course I get now why the series received so many awards.Lee Jong Suk plays someone who has gained the ability to read minds, after he was involved in a car accident which killed his father when he was a child. The driver who hit the car, actually aimed at killing both father and child, however the main actress was present and even though she was intimidated into not going to court to testify whether the accident was no accident, she did go. The series starts basically from the point both main actors grew up. It is interesting how they meet, how they work together and how they protect one another. I would suggest this series to anyone as I believe it can match the tastes of any viewer.", "I have always loved court room dramas and legal thrillers- books, movies, soaps and sitcoms. I like those well written scripts that take advantage of the loopholes in law to build powerful twists in the plots, keeping the audience or viewers engaged till the end.

The episodes were an easy watch, interesting and entertaining. He is a high school kid who can hear people's thoughts. These extra voices in his ears make his world noisier. She is a lawyer- a public defender, quite a few years older than him. She is his first love. He admired her since she came as a witness of his father's murder to the trial 10 years ago. Searching for her when he grew up, he found her on the pages of a newspaper. Then as they became closer, from just acquaintances in a case, he starts helping her during trials- by reading everyone's minds; and she takes the responsibility of his guardian. It's just fun to watch them \u2013 when she tries to hide her humiliations and embarrassed thoughts from him, but he reads them anyhow. I like the plot twists a lot.

The drama uses cliches like amnesia as twists, but overall, it was just okay, with a so so romance, as the characters didn't have chemistry. The cases though were interesting to follow, but often the main story took over and left them in the premisses to fill in the gaps.

In addition, the main protagonist was cute and bubbly, unlike the movie's who was more of the smart and dynamic. The girl was actually lovable and the love triangle was okay, though the main couple's chemistry was bleak and I would rather had her with the second lead.

It is a difficult film to watch at times, and it does take a while for the film to get going.I'm not going to put in any spoilers but if you do not want to know anything at all about the film please just accept that it is worth it and stop reading.Im trying not to sound to geeky but imagine if David Mamet (glengarry glen ross, Ronin) wrote for chan Wook Park (old boy, lady vengeance) and you would know what I mean.OK, so half an hour into the film I thought it was just another murder film, but it really is so much more.It is not perfect by any means. the police seem clumsy at times and the film gel as well as it could, but this is all for a reason, and that reason is shown in the 20 minute finale which is better than anything Hollywood can do. It is the type of ending that has you literally hiding behind a cushion one minute, then jumping up and cheering the next.If you liked lady vengeance or dark water, this is a film for you, if you like good cinema that makes you think then again this is a good movie for you.Park may be the fashionable director at the moment, and rightly so if you have seen his films, but Eun-jin Bang who directed this film is definitely one to look out for. Also, you should watch this before Hollywood remakes it, which no doubt it will at some point.I just liked the movie, and I hope more people give it a go.", "In Seoul, the thirty-three year-old Jung Sun-jung (Jeong-hwa Eom) sees an abusive stepmother beating up on her stepdaughter in the bathroom of a department store and she stabs the woman to death with a stiletto. Detective Oh Sung-ho (Seong-kun Mun) interviews the little girl and watches the tape of the surveillance camera of the department store, finding the lead of Sun-jung. However he does not disclose his discovery to his partner. Sun-young works in a car dealer of Porches and then she kills a young woman in a massage house and later her lover in his apartment. The partner of Sung-ho finds the sticker of cartoon character Princess Aurora in each victim and Sung-ho meets and has sex with Sun- jung that is his ex-wife. She steals his handcuffs and kidnaps a taxi driver, killing him later. Then she abducts and kills the son of the owner of the restaurant Hanseung. Sung-ho finally discloses to his chief Byun Sang-ho that the serial-killer is his ex-wife and their six year- old daughter Oh Min-ah that they called Princess Aurora had been abducted, raped, killed and dumped naked in a landfill on the day of her birthday exactly one year ago. They discover that Sun-jung has kidnapped the defense attorney Kim Wu-Taek that had defended the killer Hong Gi- beom that was sent to a mental institution instead of prison. The police and the press head to the landfill where Min-ah was found expecting to meet Sun-young and her hostage.\"Orora Gongju\" a.k.a. Princess Aurora is another great Korean movie of revenge of a mother. The story is very well constructed, with an excellent screenplay that discloses the plot like a puzzle like most of the Korean films. The story begins with a serial-killer murdering people apparently without any connection but in the end there is an explanation for each death. The direction and the performances are also top-notch. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): \"Princesa Aurora\" (\"Princess Aurora\")", "For those of you that like the amount of cruelty and bloodshed in Lady Vengeance, this film will seem subtle.The acting of the female lead is convincing enough to warrant the 106 minutes of it.At first, the movie seemingly revolves around a young woman who kills mercilessly for justice. However, as the story continues, her actions became methodical and preempted. Only at the very end of the story do we actually get to know the angst, grief and pain that forced her into such a state of mind.This movie, although Korean, also reflects on the other Asian societies where wealth, materialism and self-centredness are overshadowing the importance of kindness and virtue.", "In an interview with cine21 magazine director Pang Eun-jin refers to her film Princess Aurora as \"a melodrama, and a very dark one at that.\" Unfortunately, too many people have been fixated on comparing it (often unflatteringly) to Park Chan-wook's Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. The two films have very little in common, in fact. Pang's film is a movie about grief, and the actions of the lead character are more representations of that overwhelming grief than they are about getting even. There's none of the emphasis on careful plotting and methodical execution that we get in Lady Vengeance-- just a series of seemingly unconnected crimes. In this sense, the film is more like Hitchcock's Marnie, or Truffaut's The Bride Wore Black than it is like Park's film. Indeed, the sequence in the hospital seems to be a clear reference to Truffaut's film version of the Cornell Woolrich novel. The performances in the film are all first rate, and the single flashback sequence toward the end of the film (the flashback that explains the motivations for the lead character's actions) is both heartbreaking and horrifying. Princess Aurora is a commentary on Korean society (e.g., the position of women in Korean society, Korean society's view of children, etc.), not a simple story of revenge. Where Park's film is a overwhelming and spectacular, Pang's film is quiet and thoughtful--the type of film that will leave viewers capable of appreciating its subtle style thinking for some time. It is an underrated masterpiece.", "But not the best that has been produced in that land. If your looking for the revenge master, look no further than \"Park Chan-Wook\" (or you can put the Park at the end, like it's done in Korea) and you'll get the best! Having said that, the story presented here is not bad. Not bad at all and the acting is quite good also. But the pacing, the rhythm and the overall flair of this movie, never quite feels right. The script could've used a few rewrites and I'm pretty sure, there could've been a few better fleshed out characters. But this still is very emotional and you might not like what you see, especially concerning the ending (and yes the last sentence is intended to be understood in more than one way!)!", "From the initial looks of the trailer and the poster Princess Aurora looked like a calculating, comic book-inspired revenge drama. While it's definitely about revenge, I think the screen writers have grown a bit lazy with this particular subject in recent times. ** The following comments contain some spoilers**Story here deals with an on and off lunatic, Jung Soon-jung, played by Jong-hwa Eom. She was a mother once, now left carrying mental scars. Meanwhile she keeps herself busy by killing off random (or aren't they?) mean people. Her deeds challenge the authority as after consecutive killings the only thing they uncover is the sticker of a cartoon character next to the victims. Maybe the investigation is stalled due to her ex-husband, a cop trying to become a pastor, working on this case. Before the film was able to get to the motives of the story I was irritated with a few things. The police work and psychology behind this case was made to look insignificant and felt undetailed and tension free for the most part. The death scenes were formidable, although a bit too easily conceived by the leading lady. The sex scene between the unmarried couple served no purpose, and instead should have focused on telling us something of their past. A particular scene in the spa where a staff member hears a noise, which people even next door couldn't, and after walking an endless corridor misses to see any traces of the killer, was quite dubious. The film eagerly tries to clinch for a deeper impact as Soon-jung captures the lawyer who trialed the serial killer to a mental institution instead of a prison. Jong-hwa displays her acting chops as she dangles him from a crane above the cops and press, while speaking in her daughter's voice. Sung-keun Moon, playing her ex-husband cop, achieves zero to nothing while noting how neglectful he was when the wife asked him to look for their child, to what he suggested that she should file a police report. The film gets down to the mechanics of the story, voyeuristically revealing the day the girl was abducted along with the people who Soon-jung thought were liable for her murder, with moderate conviction. The girl herself was left to brood the busy streets, but instead of going up to someone or getting noticed by anyone for hours, she decided to instead take a cab for which she didn't have enough fare, resulting in her getting kicked out and later picked up by the killer. But the further butchery of probability didn't stop there, as the vengeful mom got sent to the same cuckoo's nest where the killer was kept. Conveniently seated a table away from him to be exact. ** End of spoilers ** In conclusion, Princess Aurora was an unconvincing revenge film which might have gotten some slack 5-6 years ago, but now it gets crushed by the opposition. 2005, which early on seemed like a candidate for a year as remarkable as 2003 and 2004 in Korean Cinema, provided fewer truly remarkable features, but here's hoping for a better, stronger 2006.", "So I was out one day at my local video store and I rented 10 Asian films as I'm quite a fan of Asian cinema. I got round to watching this and have to say I had quite a good time with this and was quite impressed.The film does sort of play along with you and doesn't have any answers for the first hour or so. All you pretty much know is that you have your leading heroine (or anti heroine to some) Jung Sun (Jeong-hwa Eom) who looks perfectly innocent and cute, works as a car salesperson and starts going on a killing spree for reasons ambiguous to the audience to begin with. And she keeps playing a cassete tape that has a kid singing a song.Obviously people kill for a reason - whether they have a tormented psychological issue, or are just plain psycho or may be killing thinking they are doing society good by killing people deemed a nuisance or unnecessary to live (think Taxi Driver style). So I knew there was something more to this character, and luckily the film delivers on that aspect and the reasons for each murder she does is explained at the end as you have no idea why she has targeted some of her victims.Towards the end, it does sort of get a bit over the top but I didn't mind it and made me sympathise a lot more with the character. The policemen working on capturing her are stupid only because of the fact that the main cop also has a role to play in all that is happening.I won't say what her motivations are for killing her victims - it makes it more surprising and involving when you find out for yourself. Perhaps you could say the end is slightly clich\u00e9 but I think it was well deserved in terms of its outcome.The performances are pretty good, especially from Jeong-hwa Eom who is able to pull the film on her shoulders and combines beauty with deadly vengeance all in one while also displaying human emotions in terms of her past. While the killings can get repetitive as you still don't really know where some of it is going, it pays off at the end, though some things were a bit hazy in terms of how she just happened to have luck in finding some of her victims after everything that happened.What the film also sends in terms of its message is how we can sometimes overlook simple acts of kindness which can actually prevent major problems or accidents from happening. Our own selfish desires or self interest often results in harm to others which is apparent in any society whether it be Korean or in any other part of the world.So yeah, I would recommend this film as it was pretty solid and I found myself enjoying it while also packing an emotional depth in its form.", "A pretty good South Korean thriller, although not quite up there with the likes of THE CHASER or MEMORIES OF MURDER. PRINCESS AURORA sees the inimitable Eom Jeong-hwa as a wronged mother who sets out on a seemingly random massacre of people who offend her, and of course the police are hot on her trail.I find these Korean police procedural films to be typically gripping and PRINCESS AURORA is no exception. I loved the mystery aspect of the storyline, which gradually unfolds towards crystal clarity at the climax, even though I did easily guess the twist ending this time around. The film is also interspersed with those stark, gruesome set-pieces that the Koreans portray so well.The acting is excellent and complements the script well, and the only reason I haven't given this a higher rating is because the subject matter is so dark. It's ultimately a very sad and depressing movie, but that doesn't stop it from being decent; it's just not one of those films that screams entertainment value at you.", "The movie started out with one heck of an inciting incident, immediately bringing the audience into the story. But after establishing the characters, it went \"Hollywood\" and downhill.Some reviewers may get caught up with the story and its content, but its execution is over- the-top and silly.***spoiler alert***When the killer drags the lawyer to the dump where her daughter was found dead, police and media show up for a Hollywood circus that's just too silly. Worst still, her ex-husband cop couldn't figure out where she was going until the last possible minute - and he didn't realize his dead daughter's birthday was coming up? Come on!Even worse, after she's arrested and convicted, she ends up in the same mental institution with her daughter's killer so she could get her ultimate revenge. Ludicrous and stupid. Beyond that, unlike her previous victims who've suffered, she merely taps into his jugular and he peacefully bleeds out when her ultimate rage should have shined through.Save your time and avoid what could have been a fantastic film.", "I've watch a lot of korean stuff and this one is so clich\u00e9 and boring, ruthless murder and the stupid cop. Story looks really really dumb, we know if this thing happen in our real world all police will catch the murderer instantly because the crime she did is not smart at all. Took a very long time to catch a stupid killer. Then, I guess all korean people are really heartless to ignore an innocent child who walking around the city and highway. This movie is so overrated, just credit for all actor because they are acting very well but the story is really dumb. I've watch too many korean movie to like this, better watch \"Memories Of Murder\" again and again.", "For all it has going for it--the potential for a good twist, a unique combination of being a vigilante film and being a detective on the scent of a serial killer film, a plot concerning a woman getting revenge upon some real sleazoids that could have reached I Spit On Your Grave or Stiletto proportions, some great cinematography with a dark atmosphere, and an eerie Sybil split personality ending--Princess Aurora nevertheless ends up missing the mark. It's flaw is that is is not very suspenseful. Perhaps something is lost in translation in the captioned version, but nevertheless, the acting is not very emotional, the murder scenes, although unique, don't come as any surprise, and the plot quickly becomes transparent and predictable.

Among many Korean movies I've watched, I think this movie has a little more depth to it then some other Korean movies with simpler plots. This movie takes place in the southern region of South Korea, and about 95% of the dialogue is in southern dialect, meaning very unique and distinctive words/expressions which are very hard to translate in English while carrying the full intended meaning. For example, one of the ending lines of the movie quotes, \"I will protect her until I paint the walls with my poop,\" in Korean (before translation) this is a very comical and meaningful line, but when translated in English as above, it sounds rather awkward than funny. In addition, there are parts in the movie which may seem very very strange and weird (or simply difficult to understand or find funny) to viewers who aren't Asian. Some parts of the movie may only be understandable to it's actually intended meaning if the viewer had lived in Asia(??) I have lived in Canada for over 8 years and can see the different perspectives of the Asian viewers and the other viewers on this movie. Anyways, I found this movie GREAT!!! and recommend it to any viewers looking to look (more) into Asian culture, or are willing to challenge themselves with trying to understand what the actors/plot actually mean, other wise I recommend other Korean comedies such as \"my sassy girl\" or \"100 days with Mr.Arrogant\".

Any romantic comedy compared to My Sassy Girl would of course be not up to par.I give this a 8/10 or so. The story was actually not a bad one. The ending is somewhat a cliffhanger and allows the viewer to determine what happens(which I don't personally like in a movie) but whether it be a happy or sad ending it was still pretty good. This definitely deserves better than a 5.1 though. I would say it have at least a 6.0 Everyone is complaining about Cha Tae-hyun's character just screaming to be funny. Well, that is his character in the movie, that is his personality so I don't know why you would complain about it. Also, Son Ye-jin's character is supposed to be a crier. If any of you had the slightest clue of why she did what she did then you would understand why she cried so much. Yun Dong-geun did a great job as well. His character changed dramatically because he became better friends with Cha Tae-hyun.People need to look deeper into a film than just judge the general film itself. Why the heck bother to write a review if you do not fully understand the movie's plot.", "--->> spoiler alert <<---The movie is filled with fun and laughter.

It starts with a slight animation about two babies, Il Mae and Tae-il. The two have been best friends ever since Tae-il's mother breastfed Il Mae after her mother died. Her father bestows her to Tae Il, who first has to achieve certain conditions which include getting into university, passing the judicial exams and including the size of his... hahaha!!!Tae-il was always been a trouble-maker. That's probably the reason why Il-mae's dad hesitate to allow him to be with his daughter. Il-Mae's dad which is also Tae-il's teacher has so many condition before he can be with his daughter. Because of that Tae-il was challenge to change his stupid behavior and tries to be serious as he can be until the time that he accomplish his career.Il-mae's character was so mysterious. On the first part of the movie, you'll notice that she really hates Tae-il. Maybe because of his dense attitude. But deep inside she also feel affection for Tae-il no matter who he is. Wherein you will become aware of at the last part.\nIl-mae's mom died because of a certain disease. Since then she always comprehend and felt so sorry for her dad. She loves her dad so much.

Timeless classics such as 'My Sassy Girl' (2001), 'My Wife is a Gangster' (2001), 'Sex is Zero' (2002), 'Marrying the Mafia' (2002) can easily topple Crazy First Love in terms of entertainment value and storyline.

To protect the virtue of his daughter (Son Ye-jin), an authoritarian high-school teacher (Yoo Dong-geun) sets - and keeps changing - unreasonable standards for the young slacker (MY SASSY GIRL's Cha Tae-hyn) who has loved her since childhood, then must work WITH him when she grows tired of their constant meddling and surveillance and becomes involved with another man. Korean men do not come off particularly well in this film (but then,that would depend on who you asked). They're either shallow gadflies or control freaks with maturity issues. How fitting, then, that the only way the male filmmakers could rationalize their crazed behaviour in the greater social theme of things is to slap the progressive-minded female lead with myelodysplastic syndrome, the same terminal disease - read punishment - that killed her mother at 18. Faced with her own immortality, and in a scene far, FAR too reminiscent of MY SASSY GIRL, we FINALLY discover why she couldn't be with the man who has gone to insane lengths to win her affection and why she COULD be with a lothario who will one day find happiness with yet another woman.While it's tough to deny the calculation behind emotional scenes like those that end this film - and in Korean cinema scenes like these are legion - one can't shake the feeling that for Korean comedic cinema - indeed MUCH of Korean cinema in general - to truly move on and perhaps capture a larger international audience, Korean filmmakers may need to dispense with a great deal of the contrived, subtly misogynistic heart string manipulation that, ultimately, reinforces dated stereotypes about patriarchy, makes childish men look like pariahs and punishes women for thinking outside the box. People crying on mountaintops (and this film is has one!) are starting to wear thin. See also SEX IS ZERO for a similar treatment of these themes. 3", "I found this movie to be very ejoyable. I laughed, and I cried. Yes, the lead character's shouting was a bit much. but I wasn't that bothered by it. I don't know what else to say about it. I thought the explanation of why she didn't want to marry him was a good one. The acting was adequate. It was nice that the lead character was pretty ordinary looking. The misogny went completely over my head. I'm afraid I don't think of stuff like that when watching a movie. Should I give low marks to a film, because it shows women in a bad light, or give high marks to a film because it embraces feminism. I don't think so. The film entertained me enormously. I hope i have lines written now, let's see. Yes, I have. Hooray.", "being a person of Asian descent, i understand the cultural context from which movies like this arise. i can also see how this humor will either be incomprehensible or offensive to unfamiliar viewers.that being said, even though son ye-jin is my fav korean actress right now, and the \"man's man\" inside me might be giddy at the fact that she momentarily wears a bikini in this \"film\" - like Brian T. said, the misogynistic and patriarchal undertones of the movie are just too blatant.we Asian people can do better. as Asian men, we can do better for our sisters, mothers, daughters - than to assume roles like the father and son-in-law characters in this film.", "This is a painfully awful film. I've seen worse, but not lately (It's worse than CATWOMAN, even!). I usually find something good to write about in all the Asian films I watch, especially the Korean comedies. This one has absolutely nothing. It's not funny, it's not romantic, and i already have 4 year old that whines all day long, so why would i want to kill nearly 2 more hours of my day listening to a grown man do it. The only saving grace is the lead actress, but unfortunately it is for her beauty and not her acting.Save your dollars for the \"better\" comedic films like \"My Wife is a Gangster\", \"100 Days with Mr. Arrogant\" or even \"Please Teach Me English\". Your brain will thank you (maybe).", "The synopsis of the movie is mentioned in other reviews, so I'm just going to tell you what I didn't like about this movie. It's far too inconsistent and what starts off as a light comedy - in the mold of say, My Sassy Girl or 100 Days with Mr Arrogant - skews into soap-opera melodrama at the drop of a hat, with all players involved shouting and crying their way through proceedings. Tae-hyun Cha, who was pretty good alongside the fabulous Ji-hyun Jun in My Sassy Girl, is mistaken when he thinks that screaming at the top of his voice constitutes good comedy while all Ye-jin Son has to do is stand around and cry a lot.

It's 50 episodes long family drama and so I've been warned to carefully decide if I want to start such a long journey. For YJH, I think I would.It started out pretty clich\u00e9d, which was expected of many family dramas I've watched. But the reason to stick to the first episode is because for the first time I feel YJH is to be pity. He played a character named Park Hyun-soo, the eldest son of the family but was looked down by his family. The reason being is that his mother was kicked out of the house for allegedly having an affair with another man. Other reason would be that he couldn't control his strong-headed wife, Yoona (Han Ji-hye). Yoona hated Hyun-soo for marrying her without love and just for money. Their several confrontations finally lead to Yoona leaving the house.Hyun-soo knows that if he ever divorce Yoona, it means that he will lose whatever respect left that his father has for him. While desperate to get Yoona back, Hyun-soo met a woman with uncanny resemblance to his wife. That's when he concocted a plan to hire that woman (Mong-hee also played by Han Ji-hye) as his wife.The drama started fairly well with enough revenge plot, money-craving heirs and in-laws troubles. But with all the family dramas out there, I Summon You Gold doesn't have anything new to add. The only addition is the identical-twin characters and that's not even very original.There are times when I was speechless at the turn of conversations and events. I could laugh because I'm not sure if it was meant to be a joke.Han Ji-hye was obviously doing her best and was awarded Top Excellence award at MBC Drama Award but I could feel that YJH was not so comfortable with his character near the end. Glad he did win an award though for the bad script he had to went through.Overall, I gave it a 4. All on all, it's not an easy thing to produce a drama with 50 episodes. I gave the rating for effort and for the actors that stick to it till the end."], "728": ["All About My Romance is a 16 episode Korean TV Drama that aired during the Spring to Summer of 2013.SPOILERS AHEAD!Shin Ha Kyun and Lee Min Jung paired up in a KTV drama that's primarily a pure romantic comedy?...I'm sold!Here's your story: Ha Kyun plays the hot shot new electee to the dominant Korean congressional party, and, Min Jung portrays the young leader of the upstart 3rd party. His conservative party is all about maintaining the status quo for the ruling body and the nation's elite, and her tiny liberal party is all about reform and the betterment of the lives of the average citizen. Both representatives have fiery personalities and disagree on most everything from the start, but they soon begin to understand each other a little better and begrudgingly find some mutual common ground over time. They're both attractive and single as well, and a romance soon develops between them. From there, is just a matter of observing their push and pull relationship unfold, and, to see if these two can/will eventually be together despite their ideological differences & personal circumstances.This show is primarily geared towards the thirty-something aged viewer (though it is suitable & agreeable to both younger & older audiences). It does come with some typical melodrama of course, but I'm warning you right now that there's ultimately very little of that stuff here in comparison to most other K-dramas. This show tilts heavily on the romantic side of the KTV drama scale, with some numerous comedic moments mixed in. It is generally very upbeat in tone, and I don't recall a single character in this show that was ever sick, dying, handicapped, etc. So if you're looking for a despair filled makjang drama with an all-out abundance of angst, crying, and absurd situations, this is likely not the show for you!The oft employed 3 act play method of storytelling is utilized here, along with the typical two secondary love interests. As usual, the 2 secondary leads don't stand a chance to get the guy/girl they want, and they basically serve as impediments to the central love story; these characters push the limits of being too antagonistic at times, but hold back just enough so they aren't totally unsympathetic...Park Hee Soon and Han Chae Ah fill these roles effectively enough as Min Jung's character's former step brother, and the spunky reporter girl, respectively.There's a bunch of supporting characters as well, and they all serve their purpose satisfactorily enough. Several veterans and a couple of younger actors are on hand to fill out the roles of various aides and party members; most of these parts are devoted to dispensing advice and/or providing a good bit of side humor along the way, and most of this was done well enough...the semi-incompetent ruling party spokesman (i.e. \"porn man\") is particularly useful as the never ending butt of jokes throughout this show, and, many of these side characters (at least under a certain age) have their own little romantic relationships to deal with. There's only one child on the scene, and she's mostly hilarious in a limited role as the astute and acerbic niece of Min Jung's character.The behind the camera crew holds up their end quite well. The show is sharply written and well directed, and there's some effective use of post edit screen captions & effects along the way. The soundtrack is pretty solid too, and it evolves nicely over time to suit the nature of the unfolding story. In addition, the transition of the 3 acts is done rather seamlessly without wildly changing the overall feel of the show (which is a frequent problem with some of these shows).Basically, this show gets all the \"little things\" right for the most part, which brings us around to the performance of the two leads, and they are both fantastic. This is a real nice pairing of two stars that have excellent chemistry together, and neither of them disappoint. Shin Ha Kyun is a terrific actor who's starred in a number of big screen productions over the years (several of which are some of my all-time favorite Korean films); he hasn't been in many TV dramas to my knowledge until just recently, but he obviously has no problem making the transition to this type of production. For her part, Lee Min Jung is outstanding in her role; she brings a nice mix to the table of everything you could possibly want in your female rom-com lead. There are lots of talented and attractive Korean actresses working in this genre, but it's hard to imagine any of them doing a better job with this material than she did.This show is quite good for what it is, and the demographic it's aimed at. There's hardly anything to even grumble about. My only real complaint is the eventual incorporation of a hidden bloodline & secret family back story (which seemed a bit forced and unnecessary). For the life of me, I have no idea why Korean TV seemingly can't make a single show without invoking some type of melodramatic trope like this somewhere along the line; this show was perfectly fine as just a straightforward romantic-comedy, and it would have been better served if it just stayed that way from start to finish. There is plenty of opportunity to include that type of melodramatic story line in any number of other shows.This is not the type of show that's likely going to pull in big Korean TV ratings numbers, because it really just doesn't fit the mold for a KTV melodrama that most fans & viewers of this genre are looking for. That being said (written), this show is very witty, and it's often both charming and amusing. Personally, it's one of my favorite K-dramas from 2013!Bottom Line; If you're looking for a mostly lighthearted Korean TV rom-com series for adults, this show is Totally Recommended!8 out of 10 stars!"], "729": [], "730": ["One of my non-mainstream (being neither Asian nor living there) TV pleasures is Korean dramas - I first got hooked on the historic costume dramas (e.g. Jumong and Emperor of the Sea) about 10 years ago, and more recently have also started watching some of the contemporary ones. The local K-TV cable channel recently ran The Queen of Office (sic), a Korean adaptation of the 2007 Japanese drama \"Pride of the Temp\" in a late-night time slot. It's a funny, enjoyable office comedy/romance/farce, but with a serious tale of the rise of a 2-tier workforce as a backdrop. Here is the title-sequence narration:\"It's been 16 years since the Asian financial crisis. Korea now has 8 million contract workers. South Koreans' foremost dream is no longer national reunification. It is getting a permanent position. While everyone else yearns for a permanent position, there is someone who has consciously opted to be a contract worker. Ms. Kim is Korea's first ever contract worker by choice. Ms. Kim never works for free. She doesn't forge cumbersome interpersonal ties. After her three-month contract period, she always leaves Korea. But no one knows how she's come to call herself \"Ms. Kim\" and chosen to be a serial contract worker.\"First, some comments about the more serious job-market backdrop for the series. In this fictional play, Ms. Kim does the exact opposite of what at-will employment for low pay and zero job-security or prospects of advancement generally results in - she manages to amass the kinds of experience in each 3-month stint which normally requires decades of work at a job and the kind of dedication that results from employer/employee reciprocity, the latter being a near-extinct beast in the modern 'globalized' jobs landscape. But the series does a good job conveying the financial/employment-parlousness suffered by Ms. Kim's less-exceptional fellow contract workers. The popular Naked Capitalism blog, whose motto is \"Fearless commentary on finance, economics, politics and power\", refers to the ever-increasing number of workers who have seen what were formerly steady jobs with decent benefits replaced by low-paid, at-will, benefit-less contract positions as \"the precariat\", in reference to the precariousness of their employment and, as a result, their lives in general. We can thank the global neoliberal-economic project for this trend. Is it any wonder that the world is seeing - belatedly, to be sure - a large-scale backlash against this elite-greed-driven system, in the form of things like Brexit and the rise of populist and anti-globalization political figures such as Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in the U.S. and Marine Le Pen in France?But, back to the merits of the TV series - because of the strong element of farce in the series, viewers expecting any form of plausibility in the relationship between the two lead characters, Ms. Kim (Kim Hye-Su) and the curly-perm-sporting chauvinist Jang Gyujik (Oh Ji-Ho, who many fans of Korean drama will be familiar with by way of his more recent serious turn in the heartrending 2016 family drama My Fair Lady, and whose character name here is a pun on the Korean phrase for \"permanent employee\"). Nevertheless the writers manage to balance the comedy with a slower-developing long story arc about a deeper hidden connection shared by the two leads. There are also fine performances by the supporting cast, most notably in form of the characters Mr. Mu (Lee Hee-Jun), Gyujik's extremely-reserved longtime colleague and friend at Y Jang Food Company, and Jang Ju-Ri (Jung Yu-Mi), a young female contract worker from a second-tier university hired around the same time as Ms. Kim, but whose situation more realistically depicts the lot of the temp-worker. My personal favorite episode is the one in which Ms. Kim, Gyujik and Mr. Mu are dispatched to appear in a role-playing exercise for the benefit of an audience of young schoolchildren at the nearby Soybean Paste Academy, wherein Mr. Rice Straw has an unfortunate run-in with Ms. Lump of Raw Bean Paste, and hilarity ensues. I rate this show 8/10, more on the strength of its strong physical-comedy aspects than its character relationships and dramatic aspects."], "731": [], "732": [], "733": [], "734": [], "735": ["Nine Times Time Travel is a 20 episode Korean TV show that aired in early 2013. This is another modern Korean fantasy drama, albeit one that it is unusually understated and low key in comparison to most of its more melodramatic &/or romantic brethren.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your basic story: A man receives a visit from his older brother shortly before said brother passes away. The older brother appeared to be insane during the visit and was claiming he had found a way to alter time. The man goes to retrieve his older brother's body and investigates his death, and he soon finds that his brother was not crazy at all; he actually had discovered the means to travel back in time via some magical incense sticks. The younger brother collects the remaining incense sticks (9 of them), and thus now possesses nine chances to alter the past. Light a stick and you'll go back in time to an exact set date for 30 minutes until the incense burns out, then you're zapped backed to the present day (where whatever you've just done in the past is instantly reflected in the present).The story focuses primarily on the young brother, who experienced a family tragedy when he was a teen that forever impacted his life and everyone he loves. He therefore decides to use the time travel incense to change crucial events in his family's history in order to prevent this tragedy from happening in the first place. He has the best of intentions, but altering the past soon becomes much more complicated than he imagined. Every change he makes for the better in the past creates unexpected future results, and he soon finds that various friends & family members lead vastly different lives or no longer recognize him in the present. As such, he keeps going back to the past to try to undo the unintended future changes he created, but things only seem to be getting worse and soon are spiraling out of control, and, he's quickly running out of magic incense sticks to rectify the situation.From there on in, it's just a matter of seeing if this guy can somehow set things right before time runs out. Moral of the story: It's probably best to not mess around with the past no matter what your intentions are.Lee Jin Wook plays the lead and primary focal point of the show, and he's quite good in what is an understated role. Everyone else is mostly a supporting character, and they're pretty good in their roles too (particularly the love interest in the present, and the younger versions of everybody in the past). Although, I must say I could've done without some of the overacting from the evil scientist dude and the lead's doctor friend...and, while I'm on the subject, I've never understood why the directors of some these KTV shows would want or allow actors to perform in this manner. In this medium, overacting occurs far too often with the some of the side characters; constantly flashing a clumsy menacing stare or wildly waving your arms around does not help make a character more evil or funnier, respectively. It doesn't work and its distracting more than anything else, and you usually end up occasionally chuckling at the supposed bad guy and growing annoyed of the guy who's supposed to be the friendly comic relief. A lot less brooding & mugging, and a little more subtlety for these 2 particular characters is definitely in order here, as is also true with many other non-protagonist characters on many other Korean dramas.This show doesn't seem to have a whole lot of money to throw around, but it never looks overly cheap; productions values are solid for its given budget, but there is very little excess in any form or fashion to be had here. It's paced well enough, and the story & writing is quite good as well; it almost seems that this was written in advance (and, not \"on the fly\", like most K-dramas are). The interactions across time, between the younger and older versions of the same protagonist, are quite well done in particular.There's definitely a minimalistic feel to this entire show (which I found to be somewhat refreshing for this genre), and this approach extends itself to the story as well; it retains many familiar melodramatic elements & themes & story lines that you'll find in this genre, but it does so w/o love quadrangles, meticulously styled auxiliary antagonists, etc. For Korean TV, this is basically a no frills drama about the implications of trying to change your past, and overall, it is quite good at accomplishing this.Summary: This is a subdued, and rather well done, KTV time travel melodrama that I rather enjoyed for the most part. Yeah, it's got some flaws, but what K-drama doesn't? I can see that it might not play all that well to some of the masses that most K-dramas are geared towards, as it's just neither a very flashy, sexy, or romantic soap opera type of show. There's nothing wrong with flashy/sexy/romantic K-dramas, and I like some of those shows too, but if you don't necessarily need or want a show like that, while still getting your K-drama fix on, this show might work quite well for you.Bottom Line: 8.5 out of 10 stars!Very Well Recommended!", "What would you do if you had the power to travel back into time and change events in your life? Should one play God with people's lives? Should one alter the natural order of things? Is it a curse or is it gift? You know you're watching something remarkable when you are still thinking about it when it's long over. I took a chance and recently binged watched this show on HULU, and I'm so glad I did so. It hooks you in after the first episode in the twenty episode series. The story is amazing and full with epic, beautiful moments that touches your heartstrings and make you feel for the characters. The beautiful memories and the tender simple moments of affection, humor, and angst are better than ninety percent of American television shows on the air today. It also did not hurt that Jin-wook Lee, the star of the show is very easy on the eyes with the charming, sarcastic, humorous, and commanding portrayal of his character Park Sun Woo. Lee is a handsome leading man with a captivating presence that draws you in, and you understand why his love interest, Joo Min Young has been in love with him for five years. There are just moments when you could just admire him turning around in a room or the camera focusing on him simply sitting down. It is like admiring stills of Brad Pitt in the Curious Case of Benjamin Button.This show itself is about a man named Park Sun Woo, a well-known television reporter, with a pretty good life. He travels to Nepal after learning that his brother Park Jung Woo was discovered dead hiking in the snowy mountains of Nepal. He discovers that his brother Park Jung Woo was searching for these nine incense sticks (hence the title nine time travels) that allows him to travel back in time on whatever day it is, twenty years in the past. Park Sun Woo uses the sticks to go back into time to altered events to save his brother's life and also to fix his family. His father died twenty years ago in a fire. His mother is in some type of nursing home for Alzheimer's disease and his brother was a drifter throughout his life. He uses the sticks to fix everyone else's problems and ends up altering his own life in the process. The show questions karma, morals, and consequences of our decisions and how it affects our lives or even the lives of the people around us.There are so many great moments in this show and even the special effects were amazing. The love story between Park Sun Woo and Joo Min Young is so sweet, beautiful, and romantic. You're scooped into it in the first few minutes when she smiles and waves to meet him at the airport; he spots her and kisses her then asked her to marry him out of the blue. I could relate to Joo Min Young because I see some of her characteristics in me, and it's amazing to see her character along with the other characters evolve throughout the show. It's an amazing show with beautiful scenery, storyline, an amazing love story, and great writing\u0085it's amazing all around. I enjoyed it from the pilot episode to the end and I still am thinking about it and the endless possibilities of alternate realities, the butterfly effects, and how one moment can alter your entire life. It was a beautiful story full of heart and leaves still thinking about it long after. Definitely recommend checking it out if you have the opportunity to watch it.", "I was in Nepal when i was a lad. The first scene of the drama hence attracts me to stay over till the end. The breathtaking snowy mountain, the fresh air... Let me recall the fond memory in Nepal. And my six sense is right. The drama turns into a terrific one that I have not ever encountered.The plot is creative and logical. An atypical time travel drama. The male lead can go back to the past and change the history. He hope to save his brother's life through altering the past, but ending up creating more fuss for the present life. He has to go back to the past and fix the problem he bring about. Acting of male lead is superb. Different from the typical oppa his skin is blacker, making him less korean. The female lead is not very overwhelmingly beautiful and girlish, but is boyly with her short hair, refreshing, young and look innocent. I would say this kdrama is not so korean. Its emphasis in history changing storyline instead of the loveline, the foreign look of lead couple, the Nepalese view background, all make the series a star shining out from the many kdramas i have come across.You must not miss it.", "I watched this over three days and I absolutely loved it it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through yes the acting by the supporting actors were way over the top especially the villain and the doctor friend but it didn't matter a good story of how meddling in fate can make your world and those around you worse off than before and what happens when you try to sort it out there were all the usual Tropes that go with Korean drama but if you are a fan you won't care. Loved it", "Attractive leads, (although I thought she was too talkitive. But when the story required her to play more serious scenes, and she became less hyper,you might say, I appreciated her acting more. I think though the best perormance came from Jeon No-Min as the brother.", "Time stories in movies or TV shows are such that when they are done well, they are golden. Such movies like \"Back to the Future\" or \"Terminator\" are such examples of writing that gets it right. However, when they are done poorly, they are usually a hotbed of contriving, convoluted messes. And \"Nine: Nine Time Travels\" is one that gets most everything wrong.You'd think that it's bad enough to have plot holes so huge that you could drive a Sherman Tank through it, but the performances from nearly everyone in the cast is one-dimensional, and in some cases, so goofy and silly that you can't help but roll your eyes and laugh.You will also laugh out loud at the worst \"hammer vs. baseball bat\" sequence ever shot. You also get a man who's struck by a car, while inside of a phone booth. If he wasn't killed on impact, he'd be rendered unable to do much of anything, assuming he was even conscious. And yet, he is able to record five messages on his phone, and have a conversation with a little girl who laughingly asks, \"Mister, are you hurt?\" Covered in blood, even an eight-year-old wouldn't have to ask such a pointless question. These are just two examples of characters and situations being written so badly that you can't help but chuckle. Believe me, there are plenty more in this series!Any time you sacrifice rational character actions for the sake of the plot, you've already made a mistake. This is basic plot development 101! The acting by Jin-Wook Lee (Sun Woo)is largely unimpressive. He manages a stoic look in nearly every situation that he's in, and a goofy smile that doesn't look real or genuine. It's like he has to try...and fails miserably!Yun-hie Jo (Min-Young Joo) is either flirting (badly), crying (at least have of the time) or speaking in a pouty tone that is beyond grating. Her romantic scenes with Jin-Wook Lee completely lack chemistry and the girl has no clue how to do a kissing scene. Tight-lipped, it's almost pathetic.Still, the worst performance easily rests with Dong Hwan-Jung (Jin Chul-Choi), the nemesis of our story. He has only one facial expression for nearly every situation. I don't believe he is intentionally trying to be goofy, but that's how he comes across. He is unimpressive and unbelievable in the role. I'm not sure that they could have found a worse actor for this part. I've now watched a number of Korean series. Descendants of the Sun is still, by far, one of the best series I've ever seen. \"Stranger\" is nearly equal to it. This series was a complete waste of my time. I will say that, despite the sub-par/terrible performances by the actors, the story held my interest for a time before everything fell apart. If you want to see one of the best \"time travel\" shows in recent years, watch Japan's \"Erased.\" You can find it on Netflix, and it is absolutely terrific!Do yourself a favor, and go with something else. Stay clear of \"Nine: Nine Time Travels.\" I'll wager that given twice the time, they'd still never get this one right."], "736": [], "737": [], "738": [], "739": [], "740": [], "741": ["That Winter the Wind Blows. KTV love story melodrama. 16 episodes. Early Spring 2013.SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: This is the 2006 Korean movie 'Love Me Not' remade into a TV drama with a different cast, wherein a young heiress discovers that everyone around her is trying to take advantage of her newfound wealth. She's at a disadvantage in her fending for herself though, because she happens to be blind, suicidal, and has a brain tumor!. Yep!!! This would be a little hard to swallow if this weren't Korean melodrama, but it is, so you're just going to have to roll with it!A con man with low morals and gambling debts quickly shows up to scheme the blind woman out of her money; he was (SPOILERS) friends with her actual long lost brother (who's now dead), so he assumes her brother's identity and gets to work trying to steal a fortune. The con man soon finds his new found \"sister\" is somewhat of a kindred spirit though, and he begins to pity her and quickly regrets what he's doing. Slowly but surely, he begins to truly want to care for her as the oppa she's always been missing, and then ultimately, he starts to fall in love with her.If you've been around the block with these shows, you know where all this is headed; Can con man become a decent guy? Can blind woman find her reason to keep on living, if she doesn't die outright anyway? Can these two help each other heal over time, and perhaps eventually be together and find love and live happily ever after? Blah, blah, blah!This particular series is primarily a simple slow burn romantic/tragic melodrama when you get down to it. I typically don't like these shows very much because they're usually relentlessly bleak and somber, and they're often quite boring to boot as a result. To be fair, I personally prefer romantic K-dramas that are more lighthearted & fun, or completely outrageous. This show plays it straight with its story for the most part, and although it tries to avoid being too tedious, it can be VERY slow moving at times (especially down the stretch).The reasons for the two leads to fall in love are a bit sketchy, and, their love sometimes lead to being borderline creepy in an incestuous way. I've seen this semi-incest theme in a number of K-dramas over the years, and it never fails to rub me the wrong way. There's always some out/excuse/reason so that it's not actually incest, but it frequently comes across as just being plain \"icky\"!Jo In-Sung plays the con man. He's got a nice charisma to him, and, he does pretty decent work here in the role he's given. Song Hye-Kyo plays the female lead. She's solid too (as usual), and she gets bonus points for having to portray a blind woman week after week. There's nothing wrong with either of their performances, but it's hard to really like either of their characters in the long run because of the nature of this show and the characters themselves. There's a few other primary supporting roles, the most prominent being the blind woman's caretaker/stepmother, and the mob henchman who the con man has to pay back. There's also your two secondary young pretty characters (played by Kim Bum & Eun-ji from APink ) who aren't really all that essential to the main plot in the scheme of things; they get the job done well enough in their subordinate parts, and they're arguably more likable than anybody else in this show by default.There are some problems that hold this show back from being just better than average IMO. It has some really bad pacing issues as it progresses, and, several of the story lines & relationships don't really make a whole lot of sense as the plot unfolds, such as (SUPER SPOILERS): A) Evil stepmother actually truly loves blind girl and will be sad if she ever has to leave her? Wait! What?; B) Con man's gangster friend must kill con man if he doesn't pay off his debt by an exact date?...why?...his death would clearly benefit no one because you can't collect debts from a dead guy; the only reason this story angle exists is to serve as a contrivance for the con man to have a \"made up\" reason to face his own mortality (i.e. so he can supposedly better identify with the dying blind/tumor girl he's in love with); C) Can you operate on the blind/tumor girl or not?...make up your mind will you!; D) The con man's gangster friend also has stomach cancer and he's dying too, but he sort of wants to reconcile with the con man (or maybe kill him) over something that happened to a girl they both loved when they were younger?...why?...is any of this back story nonsense really necessary?; and on and on it goes.This show is not overly terrible, and there are several things to like throughout, but I can't really recommend it as being anything more than just barely OK. It screamed to be only 10-12 episodes long (even though I realize that is unrealistic in this genre), and, it just hammers you with so much nonstop agony & misery that the central love story ultimately gets lost along the way. This mix of love, life, and loss should never be as difficult or complex (and depressing) as these shows tend to try to make you believe it is, and, the more these shows try to convince you otherwise, the worse things will inevitably get. There's a fine line between an epic sad love story saga versus an unenjoyable & overwrought emotional tale that's not all that coherent or cohesive. This is a perfect example of a show that is equal parts both!Summary: Skip this show and watch the movie 'Love Me Not' instead; you won't miss anything and you'll save yourself 14 hours.Bottom Line: 6 out of 10 stars.", "I love a melodrama that tells a story in the long mini-series format. In this regard, I have discovered some gems in some recent South Korean TV mini-series. The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back, and this may recur again. Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved. If personality dynamics are properly depicted in a valid manner, and if the production is skillful, powerful emotions can be evoked in the viewer. In this way we can live many lifetimes through movies, in our one lifetime - greatly enriching our experience.These South Korean productions (on Netflix streaming) are first class with excellent production and direction, some terrific casting and acting (particularly from some of the females who give some world class performances), brilliant musical accompaniment and staging. What makes these so good is the way they skillfully evoke deep emotion in the viewer. South Korean movie making is impressive.However, the following caveats must be considered. They are subtitled and some people hate this. The South Korean cultural norms, values and sanctions may sometimes seems silly or old fashioned to the USA viewer. The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation/unity - sometimes reminiscence of old Capra films.Also, in order for the sometimes complicated sub-plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing. This leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people which sometimes seems unlikely by USA cultural standards. The viewer may wonder at times why good but trusting people are so easily manipulated and deceived by bad and selfish people, but con artists do often succeed (just look at politicians for example). This poetic license of implausibility is needed to develop the story - just accept it even though unlikely at times. Taking these factors into account will help you become involved and emotionally engrossed. It was hard for me to quit watching at times so I binged watched.I would rank these as follows but tastes differ and your rankings might not agree: 1 - 4 (hard to say which is best)Shining InheritanceWhen a Man LovesThat Winter, The Wind BlowsSecret Garden5. Five Fingers6. The Scent of a Woman7. The Great Queen Seondeok8. A Hundred Years Inheritance9. Lie To me10. Roof Top Prince11. Dr. Jin12. The Great Doctor\"That Winter....\" is story of good and evil, a poignant story of love overcoming sociopathy (criminality and hate), nicely paced and developed, engrossing and involving thanks to great acting, music and production/direction. However, the ending is flawed because of what is left out, requiring the viewer to fill in the blanks. To help you fill in the blanks without any spoiling, let me offer this: The stabbing death only seems to be, the void of the scene is that the person was saved and lived, but this fact was concealed to call off those wanting the death. Without this info the ending seems perhaps strange.Another reviewer unjustifiably denigrates this series.First, this reviewer states a dislike for love melodramas preferring comedy. Such a preference can cause a negative prejudice toward \"When Winter Comes...., and if you have this prejudice you can find fault with this one.Second, if you have extremely strong feelings against incest you will be disturbed with any mild hints of mild and false incest as in this series, but there is no incest at all in this series. Psychologically, most people have instincts against incest, but some people lack such negative incest instincts and there are cases of happy incestuous relations that cause no harm whatsoever. Most cases are harmful, where trauma was induced by one of the partners who forced/coerced incest onto the other unwilling partner.Third, the negative reviewer questions how the evil nanny (erroneously described as the \"stepmother\" by the negative reviewer)does harm to the girl yet later loves her greatly. Here you have to understand the evil-good character transition of the nanny who was initially hired to take care of the girl and sexually service the father. She was an outcast from her family and desperately needed the nanny job and thus degraded herself. She committed evil toward the girl in order to create a continuing need for employment as a nanny and be in a family. With time she comes to truly love the girl, and secure an important job in the company, and then becomes good rather than evil. Morality is a luxury - Dr. Arthur Wells. As this love and relationship developed over the years the nanny felt guilty but became devoted to the girl. We sometimes hurt the one we love, feel guilty, and become more loving as a result - it happens.Fourth, the negative reviewer wonders how the hired hit man threatens to kill the other man in order to collect a debt for the hit man's gangster boss (who ordered the other man killed out of the gangster's jealousy over his girlfriend who was in love with the man to be killed, using the framed debt as an excuse). What is the problem in this for the negative reviewer? What is also overlooked in this is that the hit man has extra incentive to kill the other man since that man is blamed by the hit man for the death of someone the hit man loved. Did the negative reviewer really watch the series?", "That Winter, the Wind Blows is the pinnacle of Jo Insung's career. He made an impressive comeback as Oh Soo the conman who falls in love with the blind heiress. Jo Insung had a 5 year absence, his previous work had been in the film \"A Frozen Flower\" where he was criticized for his bland acting; however he comes alive here with sensitivity and luminescence. It was as if the part was written for him. He makes it entirely his own and has great chemistry with the lead actress the lovely ethereal Song Hye Go. Jo Insung's crying scenes were particularly wonderful and genuine especially the scene where Oh Soo talks about his background. That Winter, the Wind Blows is about redemption and forgiveness. At times the story seems to lag on and nothing seems to happen, however the gorgeous production, wonderful setting, cinematography and great acting makes it all worthy."], "742": ["The ending of the original Iris television series was a complete let down. Terribly written, this sequel continues with bad writing and storyline.", "Somehow, all through the 20 episodes of Iris-1, Ailiseu (original title), I was able to keep the characters straight, although Westerners have difficulty sorting faces of Orientals, and the names are tricky, too. In Iris-II, I don't know who is who after a single viewing, although the performers are quite capable of portraying a character, and delivering some great stunt-fighting, also.From IRIS-1, I think the head of the North Korean Secret Service is the same guy (but we don't see him much), but the main holdover character is double-agent, Park Cheol-yeong, who is imprisoned now by the South Korean Secret Service (NSS), of which he was once a top boss. Anyway, IRIS wants him back, since he (alone) knows where some nuclear weapons are stashed. There are a few battle scenes and ambushes that involve IRIS bad guys attacking NSS units, nominally to get Park back. Park is having second thoughts about his nefarious connections, however. The rest you will have to figure out. Some characters seem to be playing on both sides, which will probably have you saying, 'Boy.. he sure looks like that other guy who plays for the bad guys..'. He (or she) may actually be doing that - I can't say for sure just yet.No word on our heroes from IRIS-1, which, after 20 episodes, was destined to have a happy ending and marriage for the two star-crossed lovers & protagonists of the series, when, in the final frame, a sniper's bullet ended all that. Unlike an American Soap Opera, at least we didn't get both lovers surviving with temporary amnesia! Nonetheless, I was hoping for some wrap-up or concluding info on that tragic event, but the Producers played hardball, and just carried on with a new potential crisis. O, well, woe is me.IRIS-II is a good shoot-em-up entry, lacking the scope and intricate character development of the first series (this is only a 2-hour movie, after all). It might give you partial closure on IRIS-1, but, I think it's a bit muddled: looking at the photos on the DVD jacket, I couldn't tell you any of the character names, nor distinguish the bad guys from the good. At least there won't be an IRIS-III (if they ever do make one, I will write the producer and ask for name tags).6/10 Canuckteach"], "743": [], "744": [], "745": [], "746": [], "747": [], "748": [], "749": ["Queen of Ambition (24 episode 2013 Korean TV series) Here we go again; another poor, down on her luck, woman gets the chance to rise to wealth and status. I'm starting to lose track of how many of these similarly themed K-drama shows I've seen over the years, and, there seems to be no shortage still being made. As the title suggests, this show squarely falls into the \"woman who will stop at nothing to succeed\" category.SPOILERS AHEAD!Our story begins in the present, where Joo Da Hae is the wife of Korea's President, and, Ha Ryu is a special prosecutor who's come to arrest her for her misdeeds. These two struggle with a gun until one gets shot (and is presumably dead), but, you can't tell which one takes the bullet. This all happens in the first 10 minutes of episode 1, and sets the stage for the story to come. The rest of the show is then told in the past, from the time Da Hae and Ha Ryu first met, on up through time, until they finally arrive back in the present.As the story unfolds, we're introduced to Da Hae & Ha Ryu in their young adult lives as they meet again after not seeing each other since they were children. They begin a relationship, and, they're both fairly likable and make for a really nice couple in the beginning. Things start to unravel for them over time though, and Da Hae soon morphs into a heartless witch with zero redeeming qualities. She eventually takes all of Ha Ryu's money and leaves him & their daughter for a wealthier man without even telling anybody. From there, Da Hae keeps on climbing the \"ladder of success\" while stepping on the throats of everyone she comes across.You'll find all the usual tropes that come with this genre; jealousy, family secrets, blackmail, allegiances, & power struggles are the norm. Even knowing what to expect, this show is often ridiculously over the top. Here's a sampling: (SPOILERS) Da Hae gets divorced, gets abducted, leaps from a moving car & goes on the run, cracks a safe & steals secret docs, slams her aunt in the face with a briefcase to make her escape, gives her father-in-law with the magnificently outrageous toupee a heart attack, gets her brother-in-law beaten to a pulp, tries to blow up her first husband with a car bomb but blows up her 2nd husband instead, and, sneaks off to America with the future President of Korea. All of this happens over the course of ONE SINGLE EPISODE!If that isn't enough to convince you how unhinged this show gets, this should do it: (SUPER SPOILERS) Da Hae also, directly or indirectly, gets both her brother and one of her husbands sent to prison, stabs her adoptive father to death and buries him in the woods, gets her own daughter run over and killed by a truck, kills at least one of her husbands in an \"accident\", kills the brother of another husband and dumps him in a river, kills some unlucky medical examiner, and, kills some lady's horse for good measure. There's also various secret family bloodlines, murder/suicide mysteries, identical twins, rigged elections, orphan back stories, etc. Whew!!!Your 2 leads are played by Park Soo Ae & Kwon Sang Woo; they're both experienced and solid throughout. Sang Woo plays Ha Ryu (& his twin brother); he does a fine enough job of portraying the pitiable man who becomes more obsessed with punishing Da Hae as the story unfolds. in addition, his \"body\" of work here is also sure to not disappoint the ladies in some of the earlier episodes. Soo Ae is the star though, and she makes for one terrific deceitful crazy woman in her portrayal of Da Hae; her role basically consists of flashing her inviting smile while simultaneously being a devious lying psychopath. She also gets the high fashion treatment throughout this show once her character is afforded some money. She looks great of course, but the sheer number of ensembles she's provided is astonishing; she practically has a new outfit to wear for each separate scene she appears in. I've never seen anything like it; even K-dramas centered around the fashion industry pale in comparison to the massive wardrobe afforded De Hae's character here. But, you might as well be fashionable when you're busy killing and/or ruining the lives of everyone around you!The secondary cast is suitable enough, but, they're all merely \"pawns on the board\" in the scheme of things. More or less, each of the two leads hatch various schemes to accomplish their goals, their efforts are summarily thwarted by the other, then repeat this scenario until we arrive back in the present to reveal the final conclusion. How it plays out from start to finish is outrageous and often amusing though; it can paraphrased as: \"Sorry your plot to burn me to death in a warehouse fire didn't work out yesterday, but I'll see you at tomorrow's board meeting where I will implement my next plan to destroy you!\"Ultimately, this is a tale about greed & revenge between a man and a woman; one that is almost completely devoid of any love/romance angle once it hits its stride (which is a little unusual for a K-drama). Despite all the killings and mayhem, it's really not that violent or action packed either. I honestly can't say this show is all that great, but it does have some enormous appeal on the guilty pleasure scale, and, I did have a good deal of fun watching it. If nothing else, I really have to hand it to the writers of this show for their relentless \"anything goes\" approach to overly dramatic storytelling.Bottom Line: It's awfully silly and beyond absurd, but, it's immensely watchable anyway (that is, if you're into this sort of thing). I liked it well enough. Giving it 7 out of 10 stars!", "If you want to experience the mind and actions of a narcissist ice queen with murderous intentions, this drama is for you. There are twists and turns in every episode leading to the exposure of the femme fatale."], "750": ["Flower Boy Next Door is a 2013 Korean comedy-romance-drama series. It's the 3rd installment in the Flower Boy series and, like the other shows before it, it is extremely light in tone. You'd be hard pressed to think of too many other K-dramas that are \"softer\" than this one is.SPOILERS AHEAD!First off, this show has nothing to do with flowers; \"flower boy\" is a Korean idiomatic expression that essentially means \"pretty boy\". Our story begins by introducing the titular \"flower boy\" to the primary character (Go Dok Mi); Dok Mi is the shy shut-in type girl who has a crush on the handsome young doctor she watches in the building across from hers. Dok Mi is perfectly content living alone in her apartment and interacting with no one; unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately, as the case may eventually be), Dok Mi's neighbors are an odd collection of outgoing personalities that become increasingly harder for her to avoid. The most prominent of these neighbors is the character named Enrique. He's the \"flower boy\" that catches Dok Mi spying on his doctor cousin, soon realizes she's a lost & lonely soul, and takes it upon himself to bring Dok Mi out of her shell and into the world around her. Actually, all the male neighbors are \"flower boys\" to some degree, but Enrique is the most \"flowery\".Dok Mi is the way she is because of something that happened to her back in high school that made her not trust people and withdraw from society. Having a crappy high school experience doesn't really rank all that high on the life problem scale in the long run; when you're in high school though, or not far removed, there is nothing of greater importance than NOT having a crappy experience at that stage of your life, and, that's what we have here; a young woman who just can't get over her past and move on with her adult life.Park Shin Hye plays Dok Mi. She's pretty effective at portraying the perpetually weary/sad eyed introvert who slowly begins to overcome her fears/wounds as the series progresses. She gets the job done about as well as can be expected of what's asked of her. Yoon Si Yoon plays Enrique; the young and playful expatriate who has nothing better to do than dote on Dok Mi while he's back in Korea; he gives a nice enough performance as the relentlessly positive and energetic pretty boy who simply wants to help Dok Mi, but soon finds himself falling in love with her instead.The two secondary M/F parts involve the guy that lives next to Dok Mi, and Dok Mi's former high school girlfriend. He's had a crush on Dok Mi for some time, but he's never been able to approach her in order to get close to her. It's an indication of how light this show is that neither he nor Enrique really even compete for Dok Mi via expected methods. Dok Mi's former schoolmate is the only antagonist here, but she barely even qualifies as one, as she and her gaggle of cohorts are about as bothersome as a litter of hungry kittens. She's a scheming spoiled brat of course, and she was rotten to Dok Mi back in school, but she's mostly pretty harmless overall. There are a number of small side stories as well (involving the kooky webtoon editor, the security guard, neighbors, etc). These side stories are mostly played for comedic &/or romantic effect, and, they work well enough to serve as a compliment to the main story line.This show skews VERY young; the cast is packed full of attractive young people dealing with young people problems. This show is also frequently silly and sickeningly sweet, and the melodrama is so inconsequential in the scheme of things; nobody's dying, nobody will lose everything, nobody's family is at stake, etc. It's more of the \"I'm sorry your feelings were hurt, so here's some ice cream\" type melodrama. It's an effective series though that's fairly well written, performances are solid throughout, and it's well paced and nicely scored with an appropriately cutesy soundtrack, etc. There's not a whole lot of meat on its bones, and, it may contain the least amount of masculinity in any K-drama I've ever seen (and that's saying something), but otherwise, there's really not much to dislike here.On the down side, there were two minor sub plots that didn't work very well; one involves the guy living next door having a secret rich family, and the other involves Enrique's troublemaking fan club. The former story was pointless and unnecessary, and the latter had too much importance placed on it. I also wasn't really fond of the way Dok Mi's suitors came across as borderline stalkers on occasion, who were blindly insistent that Dok Mi was in need of their help, when in fact, they had just as much \"growing up\" to do as she did; that was really the whole point of the show though (i.e. these guys help Dok Mi heal over time while she serves as the impetus for everybody to find out more about themselves, move forward in life, discover love, etc).Through it all, this show is consistently funny and charming, and, its biggest attribute is that it never loses sight of the fact that this is where its heart lies. The other thing going for this series is that it's sixteen 40 minute episodes, and I love this format because it results in very little time for filler or dragging things out, and everything's usually pretty snappy as a result. Get in, get out, move on to the next scene, episode, series, etc. I wish more K-dramas utilized this format actually.Bottom Line: This is an adorable little show with a simple and approachable story, and, it's often quite good!...As a bonus, it's also easy to watch/ignore while pretending you don't like it (in case you're too manly or mature to admit as much).Nicely done overall!...8 out of 10 stars!", "This was my first Korean Rom-com . It's very intelligently written love triangle centering around a introvert girl .It's drags at times towards the last few episodes but that's a minor fault . for the major part , it's a very tight comedy which will end up you teaching a lot . I love quotes by the girl where she summaries what's going on in a very beautiful way in almost every episode . I felt they are kinda a profound or may be it's just my first Rom-com :) . the shows doesn't bores you with a lot of fillers or drags , other support-cast in the series are quite good and keep the interest ongoing", "Flower Boy Next Door is an enjoyable and engaging 16 episode Korean drama from 2013 and is the third installment in cable network TVN's excellent Flower Boys series - Flower Boy Ramen Shop (loved), Shut Up Flower Boy Band (loved) and finally Flower Boy Next Door (loved).Video game designer Enrique is the human Energizer Bunny, fast talking, positive, and engaging.Work from home editor Dok-Mi avoids human contact because of a scarring incident from her high school days.Enrique catches Dok-Mi peeping out at her neighbor (and his cousin). Amazed the peeper is a quiet, shy, woman; Enrique is intrigued. He finds he intrinsically understands Dok-Mi, which is unsettling to her.Next door a handsome web comic illustrator and writer live. The writer, Jin-Rok, has secretly crushed on Dok-Mi for years.What I loved about Flower Boy Next Door: 1. One True Pair (OTP) was darling and engaging. I loved Enrique's enthusiasm and dogged determination to draw out shy-flower Dok-Mi. Dok-Mi dealt with her demons then in a turnabout, becomes the positive force while Enrique deals with his demons.2. Next door neighbors were handsome and fun. Jin-Rok was the perfect second lead, kind, caring, but misses his chance by hanging back too long. Roommate Dong-Hoon was funny, handsome, and had his own cute love interest in raccoon eyed web comic manager, Seul-gi. She steals every scene with her intense reactions.What I did not love about Flower Boy Next Door: 1. Dok-Mi's high school demon Do-Whee was a stock mean-girl and was not appealing but irritating.2. The storyline faded a bit in the latter third of the series. The story was strong while Dok-Mi's re-entered the world. The story faded when Enrique had his troubles, relying on clich\u00e9s and insufficient obstacles for a couple of episodes. The show ends on an upswing.3. Third flower boy, Watanabe, had a tiny storyline and could easily have been dropped from the show. Enrique's friend and first love, Yoon-hye, who loves his cousin, was more annoying than endearing.", "The second best drama of the flower boy series focuses on the story of an urban Rapunzel, who can't come out of her apartment. Due to some past trauma, the girl is afraid of socialising and she prefers to stay at home, spying on her neighbour, with whom she's in love with. That's until a friend of his from Spain moves in with him. So, the drama had a good love triangle dynamics, but, for me, the early resolution of the romance was the main element that killed this drama. Even though the cast was armed with some major names of the Korean industry, the romantic atmosphere wasn't delivered. Other than that, the drama was very light, with elements of a webtoon added here and there, making it fun and easy to watch. Following the flower boy saga pattern, it was consisted by bright colours and some unrealistic events. But, all in all, it was cute, so 4 out of 10."], "751": [], "752": ["Sirius is a 2013 KTV special series; it's a 4 episode crime based melodrama concerning the changing lives of two twin brothers. It clearly lies on the grim side of K-drama, but it's pretty solid overall & quite entertaining.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Two twin brothers kick off the show during their high school years; one of the brothers (Shin Woo) is timid and gets picked on by his classmate, while the other brother at different school is a strong willed, albeit decent, guy. The tougher brother (Eun Chang) is fed up that his twin is being bullied, and sets off to teach Shin Woo's tormentor a lesson. Unfortunately, Eun Chang ends up accidentally throwing the bully off the school roof top and is subsequently arrested for murder & sent to jail.Flash forward a few years when Eun Chang is being released from prison. Shin Woo is there to greet him with the news that their mother is now dead. It's clear the two brothers have both grown and changed a lot during Eun Chang's incarceration. In many ways, it's almost as if the two have switched personalities over time. Shin Woo is now a coldhearted, high ranking police detective, who relentlessly pursues drug trafficking crime rings. Eun Chang on the other hand, is a repentant and more kindhearted soul, who realizes he wasted some of the best years of his life on a momentary rash decision, and now has little to look forward to in the future as a result.The star of the show is Seo Jun-Young, who plays both the twins (from high school on up to the present). He gives an impressive performance, and it's a good thing he did, because this show borders on being a one man play. I'm scratching my head trying to think of other K-dramas that put as much emphasis on one single actor/actress, and I really can't recall too many others that can even compare. Jun-Young delivers in spades in his role(s), and, there were a few times I had to remind myself that it was the same actor playing both twins (even though there is virtually no effort to make them not look identical). He effortlessly switches from one personality to another throughout this show; from 2 young high school siblings, to two young adults who were shaped by the same tragic event, to grown brothers who need to switch personas & portray each other in order to eventually accomplish their goals. Seriously, the guy should win some award or something, or at least get paid double for all the work he had to do acting opposite himself in order to carry this show on his back.The secondary cast is effective enough, and include: the sinister crime boss, the mother of the twins, some cops, and the 2 female love interests. No complaints; they all get the job done, but they mostly all get lost in the wash compared to the importance placed on lead character of the show!There are a few flashback scenes along the way (usually at the start of each episode) that help better explain the history & growth of the family dynamic among the twins and their mother over time. I thought this was remarkably well done, and, it was a really creative way (due to the series' short run time) to fill in the familial back story blanks that would normally take up several episodes in other comparable, and more linear, K-dramas stories of greater length.Be advised that this show is often quite bleak in nature, and there's a fair amount of violence involved. I won't go into details at length, but for a TV melodrama, it is surprising, and sometimes shocking, what this story is willing to do to some of its characters along the way. Despite all this, Sirius is still primarily a drama about two brothers drifting apart & coming together over time, and, it nicely mixes this aspect of the show within the overall tone of its somewhat darker story line.The series can get a little outlandish, but not really any more so than many other melodramatic shows. It is quick and to the point, and, without lot of money to throw around, it has to make do with a minimum of frills to make it all work. It accomplishes its goal though, and features a rare open ended finale that doesn't wrap everything up neatly with a big bow on top. You just have to decide for yourself what the future might bring for any of the characters that are still standing in the end.Bottom Line: I thought this show was exceptionally well done. It's tightly paced with an interesting story that is compelling throughout. And as with other shows of similar minimal length, if you don't like it, it'll be over before you know it.Bottom Line: Solidly recommended. 8 out of 10 stars!P.S. I'm really starting to develop a fondness for these \"special drama\" shows that are essentially a quick miniseries in the 3 to 6 hour range. I've seen a bunch of these shows in various formats over the last few years, and, I very much enjoy this approach to storytelling. I would like more please!", "There are some plot points that are arguable, but those are minor. It is the writing that outshines all in this production.Although I've only seen Iris, Athena and Phantom (i've been spoiled), but I've seen glimpses of a few others enough to say, unlike most other long winded Korean productions that are melo-dramatic to say the least. Those typically run 16-20 episodes milk the daylight out of every plot turns, and character background.The -2 is for some extreme acting, the microphone blowing, and the overthought out title. And maybe the cinematography is almost too luscious, too caring for the setup. And for maybe 15min on some 'elements' of melodramaticness.The story revolves around identitcal twins and their growing up from a tragedy in their youthful days. Being only 4 episodes, this allow more succinct plot but the very unique inner emotions between the twins are flushed out nicely, deep down diving into the complex psych of seeing another version of yourself. And on top, being family. And on top being separated by an act of social accident.Each episodes begins with going back to the past and that leads to a particular point in that show. Well thought out. The younger twins are to me more captivating, the older one is noticeably not that old to have the emotional gut and umphhh still not beaten out of them by society yet.

As with other K-dramas I've watched, the psychological tensions between honoring one's (undeserving) parents and building an (imperfect) substitute family are at the core of the protagonist's inner conflict. The love-hate relationship between the main couple is sad AND satisfying to watch as it unfolds; just as many tears of mine fell as of theirs. And crying we all did!

Kim Myung Min is terrific in the title role Jung Ryu Won is good and likable as the female lead. My favourite sequence is him watching her as she watches a Japanese movie for inspiration. Great ending, especially for people like me, who are big fans of radio drama."], "765": [], "766": [], "767": [], "768": [], "769": [], "770": [], "771": [], "772": [], "773": [], "774": [], "775": [], "776": [], "777": [], "778": ["I was hesitant to watch this drama at first. Though I've already seen some clips of it on Youtube, I thought it was boring and mediocre. I want to stay away from melodramatic and tear-jerking dramas as much as possible, and just stick with light, fun and comedic stuff. This is one of those that carry heavy loads of emotions, which in the midst of doubt, became one of my favorites. Great story line. Very interesting yet \"frustrating\" plot. I got hooked in the first fifteen minutes run of the pilot episode.Although I'm more into cheesy and romantic kind of a story, Remember is an exception, along with Angry Mom. It talks more about crime, conspiracy, political aspects, bureaucracy and the like with very minimal romance. Sure, there are specks of unintentionally hilarious scenes, but I have no idea about the practices and implementation of laws in S.Korea, so I can't pinpoint things out for discussion. Besides, those are too little to distract viewers and ruin the entire episodes or even the story line for that matter.Otherwise, Namgoong Min and Yoo Seung-ho's acting is phenomenal! The first, stirred my anger with his crazy 'stunt' and outre behavior ,while the latter burst me into tears, almost the entire drama. The affliction of the main character(s) is real. The emotional impact is 'severe'. It affected me really hard.I highly recommend this drama. It's worth it! And it's worth it hundred times!", "Two hours into it looks good has a good story good actors but i sware every adult man in this cry every scene, i know Koreans are not like this i hope they nut up and act like real men going forward, cry cry cry please......"], "779": [], "780": ["An extremely impressive drama, very well executed by all the actors who portrayed their characters well.

Song Joong-Ki fit the role of Kang Maru very well and his chemistry with Moon Chae-won was very strong. This drama has plot twists, powerful emotion, and a very realistic ending. It's an outstanding drama, and definitely worth watching."], "781": ["The South Korean show Vampire Prosecutor is definitely odd. In many ways, it reminds me of the TV shows Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, CSI as well as Hannibal! The show has an ensemble cast that investigate murders and it's led by Min Tae-yeon\u2014a prosecutor AND vampire! I have no idea if lawyers actually investigate cases line Min in South Korea, but he certainly does. When he visits the crime scenes he's able to smell or taste the blood and see in his mind how the murders occurred\u2014a bit like how Will is able to channel the murders on Hannibal. In addition to him, the team is also made up of three others\u2014the detective Hwang Soon-bum, rookie prosecutor Yoo Jung-in and an intern, Choi Dong- man. These folks are a nice addition and the ensemble cast reminds me so much of the Law & Order franchise\u2014as does the way the cases are investigated and prosecuted. And, the heavy use of forensics in the show is like seeing an installment of CSI.Now you'd THINK that the show might be a bit like Twilight or Dracula but it's really like neither. This vampire does NOT sleep in coffins nor does he attack folks nor does he avoid the daylight like 'ol Drac but he also is NOT a sparkly, angst-ridden guy \u00e0 la Twilight! He's unique and quite professional\u2014a lawyer through and through. Plus, now that I think about it, how different are vampires from lawyers anyways? They both are blood-suckers!If all this isn't enough, the show is very well made. It's incredibly stylish, well written and kept my interest. If you like the shows I mentioned above or are really into Asian cinema, it certainly is well worth your time seeking out this unusual show. Finding it isn't easy. The season 1 DVDs are, oddly, $138 on Amazon! And, only season two is on Netflix (wow\u0085that's really helpful!!). Fortunately, it IS available through Hulu and Hulu Plus\u2014and might just make it worth subscribing to the service.", "In 2011, Vampire Prosecutor surprised many with its rather unique story of a man who became a vampire. But even in the portrayal of the story we see elements we don't often see in Kdramas; little things like consistently appropriate music, superior lighting for the scenery that makes it look higher production, and a very cool opening title sequence (not that they're usually boring, but they aren't often this cool). Perhaps most unusual was a lack of love story subplots.If you liked Vampire Prosecutor and appreciated these elements, you'll like Vampire Prosecutor 2. Only six episodes have aired so far and we see *SPOILER* that a love story might brew up after all *END SPOILER* but I'm very much okay with that. Just do it well and I'll eat it up.In all, it has few flaws and again I have to throw in the word \"unique\" to describe it. Tired of typical crime/mystery dramas? Give Vampire Prosecutor and its sequel, Vampire Prosecutor 2, a shot.", "Well to be frank, I literally thought that this show was going to suck. Cause maybe the first few minutes I started focusing on how horrible the camera man was. The scenes had too many close ups, it changed scenes like every five minutes, and the camera couldn't hold still. So I stopped watching it until I caught my friend watching it and so she told me to watch it instead since she was going to take a shower, (I couldn't find the remote to click it off) So I ended up watching it, only this time I focused more on the plot. By the end of episode 2, I was hooked. Deeply. The plot was very well made! The main character Min Tae Yeon, was very well made, as well were other characters' descriptions. Unfortunately, there were times when the acting was a bit of a cringe, but the well made plot made it disappeared. The main female lead... I didn't like her personality tbh. She was rude when it was unnecessary and she seemed really nosy in others businesses when she tells others not to get in her own. Her character was very smart, I'll give her that. Although, I thought she had a bit of a reason to behave the way she did, but that shouldn't mean to be rude when uncalled for. The 2nd male lead, his character was funny because he was a bit of a mess, but that has never stopped him. In fact, sometimes he used it to his advantage. He was actually trustworthy and very useful at times. And just to make him more human, he was a bit of a pervert. But more like a common guy liking women alot in that way. Sadly, he doesn't get anyone. The 3rd male lead is my second favorite next to the main character. Really, h e just a cowardly guy that is computer and forensics smart", "When I watch the casts' interview on TV promoting their drama, I was a little bit skeptical. I mean, really, how could I not? With Twilight movie franchises, Vampire Diaries and The Originals are currently dominating the world.What made tempt to watch this is because I've run out of K-drama to watch. Such a pitiful excuse.So, what started as let just watch this because I don't have anything else to watch turn into a binge-watching show time. I finish the 2 seasons in 2 days. What fair Vampire Prosecutor from other vampire storyline is that it is Asian-flavored. Instead of diving into a whole lot of historical existence, the story go its own way.Since every episode deal with a different case, the story managed to be different every time. They threw in dramatic-thriller, romance and comedy along the way.I have to conclude this with 7 because I want too see more romance or bromance. Also wish to see their acting gets better."], "782": ["If you are looking for complex medical cases go elsewhere (believe there's a Korean show on Emergency care).

And coincidently there are 2 brothers on either side. And eventually the dad, who is a famous neurosurgeon also gets into the mix.There are a few love interests and all this does is just plot along with some situations, cases that eventually leads to happy ending and resolution of family conflict between the 2 brothers, dad and their past.Although nothing too shocking, there were some little twists and turns and the comedy helps. There are 2 major female leads but the one with the doctor occupation is very dorky and funny.Overall, so so, but if you want a light one. This may do.

Korea drama is usually sad, but most of them are not sadder than this. The chief actor's acting is impressive. I think Ji-seob So did good a job. Cha Mu-hyeok must be one of the most miserable roles in Korea drama. The chief actress is Su-jeong Lim. I have watched \"A Tale of two sisters\" before, her performance is perfect in that film, but I love \"Song Eun-chae\" more. She is so lovely in MISA. The fans in MISA are called \"MISA disabled person\". It means they lost their life instinct and just watch this drama without doing anything. \"I think I have become one of them.", "This drama was awesome because of many reasons. First of all the scenery was winter which made it perfect for the characters to dress fashionably. The characters were also really cool. I liked the way the characters were all very extreme, and that there were no boring characters. You either liked the character in the drama or you hated their guts. The music (noon ae kouth \"snow flower\") in this drama is awesome too.In addition, this series is not too long (16 episodes), so you could watch it in just one day. The drama is good from the start, but there was one part that I did not like, which was the episodes 11 and 12. But the ending of episode 12... !!! but the ending of episode 12 really gets you back into the series. Another thing that I did not like about the series was that in about 2 scenes the microphone can be seen. However, this drama is truly still the best I have ever scene and I have shown this drama to my family and friends, and none have not liked it. Man I cant describe why this series was so great, but one thing I do know is that everybody should watch this drama. It will probably change the way your live and think forever. All the winters will remind you of this drama... No winter will ever be the same...", "I'm Sorry I Love You (Misa doesn't revolve around the typical stereotypes in Korean dramas. The storyline is unique and the acting by the two main leads are nothing short of outstanding. It focuses on a mother's love for her child and how human beings are inevitably, soft-hearted creatures.This Drama originally planned to be screened only for 16 episodes, the netizens of Korea demanded an extension and KBS complied by asking the drama's directors and producers to extend by another 4 episodes. However, the makers of the drama refused and said they couldn't and quite frankly, I'm happy they did. In fact, the drama was so popular that KBS even issued a second OST album for it due to overwhelming response. Not to mention that the last two episodes were so sad, that even the makers of the drama couldn't help but cry when the scenes were played out I don't have the vocabulary to describe So Ji Sup's performance in 'Misa'. I had watched him in 'Memories of Bali' and always knew that he was good. But this time he really outdid all of us.So Ji Sup is just perfect for Cha Moo Hyuk With comparisons to her co-star, I loved Im Soo Jung from top to bottom. She was very much what her character required to portray: A simple-minded girl without her own dreams. In the beginning, Eun Chae desired whatever Choi Yoon desired, because Choi Yoon was the epitome of her life. But once she got to know Moo Hyuk, that changed forever. \"I'm Sorry I Love You\" has a deeper meaning throughout the normal K-dramas we see about love. It dwells more on the humanity of a person", "I'm Sorry, I Love You (2004) was a 16 episode, huge television hit series made by Koreans, but popular all throughout the Asian world.Slightly soap-opera-ish in nature, it is an extremely addictive show because it develops its plot lines slowly and you really begin to care about the characters. The leads are all very attractive people (especially the awesome and incredibly handsome Ji-seob So as Mu-hyeok and the little dynamo Su-jeong Im, who was great in the Korean hit film A Tale Of Two Sisters), and their acting is realistic and evocatively emotional, and often funny as well. The music is beautiful too and the production values are excellent. It was filmed in Australia and Korea.It's the story of a petty gangster, Mu-hyeok - a street hustler growing up homeless in Australia, who is shot in the head at the wedding of a woman he loved. She was marrying a rich gangster for his money, yet Mu-hyeok, still deeply in love with her, risks his own life to save hers when an assassin shows up to kill the wedding couple.The doctors cannot remove the bullet in Mu-hyeok's brain, and they give him only a few months to live. The woman he saved gives him a lot of money and tells him to return to his homeland of Korea to die. He goes and makes a search for his birth mother whom he believes gave him up for adoption because of financial hardship. When he finds her he is shocked to discover she is rich, has another son, and so he doesn't reveal to her his identity but instead plans his revenge on her.Along the way he discovers he has a twin sister, and he falls in love with a gentle girl named Eunchae Song who works for his step-brother. Over time he begins a mellowing process. Will he cling to bitterness until the end of his life, or will he find the grace to forgive those he believed wronged him? Many surprises are in store for the viewer during this series, right up to the last scenes. There is also some wonderful humor to relieve the dramatic tension. I really loved this show and everyone I have recommended it to has become as hooked as I was! It's just as addictive as those famous British - PBS series such as Upstairs, Downstairs or The Forsyte Saga or The Duchess of Duke Street! Except the stars are all Korean! Now, there are several ways to buy this awesome series. You can order each episode off Amazon On Demand for $1.99 each, but the files have DRM copyright protection on them so you'll only be able to watch them on your computer. These are good quality files with excellent white subtitles in English.Or you can buy a 9 disc box set from KBSDVD, which is out of print now but worth tracking down because it has the best images (though the subtitles are not as good as the Amazon video files).Then there is another KBS release that is only 2 discs, but the images have been condensed to MPEG1 files instead of proper MPEG2 files, so I suggest you avoid this one. The yellow subtitles in this box-set are terrible in comparison to your other options. Ask the seller how many discs are in the set you wish to buy.Yet another box-set with 7 DVDs is available in Korea, but you're not going to find that selling here in the States because it is Region 3.However you track it down, don't miss it. It's literally the most addictive show I've watched in years and years. I love it! 10 stars out of 10.", "A soulful performance by the lead actor So Ji Sub makes this series worth watching. This could have been your average Korean melodrama however, the sincere, soulful and heartfelt performance by So Ji Sub elevates this melodrama to the highest degree. \"Sorry, I Love You\" is a journey of a young man who transforms from a minor vengeful petty thief into a decent caring human being. So Ji Sub's transformation throughout the series is quite remarkable, he displays great sadness and longing for love and acceptance. Lim Su-jeong who plays the unlikely love interest also gives a tender and genuine performance. Overall, the series has a rather karmic and dark message about \"whatever comes around goes around\". Su-jeong's father ends up suffering the most for giving up the twin babies and keeping the secret from the lead character's mother. It's not your average K-Drama the message of the drama is at the very end of the series. Great story writing and great acting by So Ji Sub makes this series one of the best K-Dramas. It's definitely worth watching.", "Please notice the spoiler alert. You do not want to read this if you haven't seen this wonderful show.As I have noticed in other Korean dramas, this one, too, attempts to tackle a social problem that arises in societies where kinship and social status based on family background are important. Here, too, we have fractured families with adopted, abandoned, widowed, or orphaned members. The only intact family is the one of the female lead (Song Eun-Chae, portrayed by the excellent Im Soo Jung), whose father bears the burden of holding the information that would have made the male lead (Cha Moo-Hyuk, played by the incredibly handsome So Ji-seob) stop hating his biological mother, and whose mother is a bitter shrew; so this family is outwardly intact, but inwardly fragmented. The search for family acceptance and love is paramount. Moo-Hyuk is a lonely and homeless outcast who preys on hapless female Asian tourists in Australia; his only emotional anchor is another Korean who marries a rich Australian for his money. As explained in another review, Moo-Hyuk gets to see Korea to find his mother during his last few months of life. Through a series of rather implausible events, he does find his biological mother, but also finds out -- erroneously -- that she abandoned him and a twin sister at birth. Bent on revenge, he focuses on whom he presumes to be his half-brother, Yune. He insinuates himself into Yune's life, almost lets him drown, watches as Yune's stylist (Eun-Chae) gets beaten up, and seduces Yune's girlfriend, until Yune loses his cool, gets into a car wreck, and is found to have a defective heart. When both Yune and Moo-Hyuk find out that they love the same girl, Eun-Chae, a terribly destructive struggle ensues that is centered on another Korean social value and thus problem: loyalty. Eun-Chae has grown up with Yune, has always been seen like a little sister by him, and is tied to him through her parents who work for Yune's mother, her own job working for Yune, and her secret crush on him. It is not until Moo-Hyuk intervenes that she realizes that she has choices in her life beyond those dictated by family ties and life history. It takes her a good amount of time, but after much agonizing, she finally chooses to be with Moo-Hyuk. He, however, cannot really set Eun-Chae free because he chooses not to let her come too close to him so that he can protect her from the certain heartbreak she would have to endure upon his impending death. Besides seeing So Ji-seob's and Im Soo Jung's superb acting, I enjoyed watching the character development of Yune (a supremely spoiled pop star), his mother (an egocentric woman clutching success), his former girlfriend (a nympho-manic starlet) and Eun-Chae's father (an unfailingly loyal chauffeur). All of them \"grow up\" by realizing their short-comings -- and it is through the homeless petty criminal Moo-Hyuk whose heart (!) was larger than theirs. Since Eun-Chae could not consummate her love with Moo-Hyuk, she commits suicide one year after his death, thus fulfilling her prophecy that they were not meant to be together in this life. I, too, grew from watching this story. My husband of two decades is here, not fatally injured, and we have sort of neglected each other's company. I better show him my love before we're in another world...", "This series is full of cliches but still somehow it tells a very special and realistic story that finds a way to touch your heart and God... hurts it!\nThe acting, chemistry between the leads and the soundtrack (snow flower) was all so good!The story takes you in and before you know, you are feeling that broken heart pain! In the last episodes I cried like crazy.

The Thornbirds, Roots and other early TV mini-series were long movies broken into consecutive episodes. I love a mini-series as a melodrama that tells a story in the long movie format, as opposed to those that tell different stories in the same setting (like Grey's Anatomy, Mad Men and to a lesser extent Damages, Breaking Bad, and Revenge that change the story at times while keeping to a general story). In this regard, I have discovered some gems in the South Korean TV mini-series of recent years.The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back. This me recur in the same story. Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved. If personality dynamics are properly depicted in a valid manner, and if the production is skillful, powerful emotions can be evoked in the viewer. In this way we can live many lifetimes through movies, in our one lifetime - greatly enriching our incarnate experience.These South Korean productions (seen on Netflix streaming) are first class with excellent production and direction, some terrific casting and acting (particularly from some of the females who give some matchless world class performances), brilliant musical accompaniment, and staging. What makes these so good is the way they skillfully evoke deep emotion in the viewer. South Korean movie making is superb - world class.However, the following caveats must be considered by the USA viewer. They are subtitled and some people hate this. The South Korean cultural norms, values and sanctions may sometimes seems silly or old fashioned to the USA viewer. The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation/unity - sometimes reminiscence of a old Frank Capra film.Most importantly, in order for the sometimes complicated sub-plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing, and this leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people, that sometimes seem to be unlikely by USA cultural standards. The viewer may wonder at times why good but trusting people are so easily manipulated and deceived by bad and selfish people, but con artists do often succeed (just look at politicians for example). However this poetic license of improbability is needed to develop the story - just accept it as occurring even though unlikely at times. Taking these factors into account Will help you become involved and emotionally engrossed. It was hard t for me to quit watching at times so I binged watched.I would rank these as follows but tastes differ and your rankings might not agree: 1 - 4 (hard to say which is best)Shining InheritanceWhen a Man LovesThat Winter, The Wind BlowsSecret Garden5. Five Fingers6. The Scent of a Woman7. The Great Queen Seondeok8. A Hundred Years Inheritance9. Lie To me10. Roof Top Prince11. Dr. Jin12. The Great DoctorFive Fingers is a 2012 South Korean TV series that is a heart-wrenching trip for those who watch all 30 episodes. The beginning episodes set the stage for the emotional fireworks that follow (and develop to the end). The plot explores the complexities of love, hate, revenge, and reparation. If you can immerse yourself in the unfolding drama, it is an emotional roller coaster ride. The many twists and turns in the plot are sometimes implausible as noted above, but ignore this and enjoy the ride.", "A woman raises two children, one of which is biologically hers. And she has good reason to believe that the second child is her husband's child with another woman, so she's not too happy about that.Frankly, I found it very enjoyable with interesting twists and turns.

Sulli being the boy is actually quite believable despite her showing some of her female side throughout the show. Minho comes out as tough and serious. He does it perfectly well, and when the time for him to be all funny and different, he does it so naturally you'd think he wasn't even acting! The supporting cast are great too. It has so much funny moments that just make you laugh ill you cry and sad moments that make you cry instantly. The music/soundtrack are also very impressive and come in the right moment! It's amazing how they do all this, I never expected this much. I clearly underestimated the Korean Entertainment Industry!

Other than that, the drama is just, well, boring. To be honest, I'm still trying to finish it, while picking up It's okay its love (note, SM idol again plays in it). However the story does not appeal to me, so it's hard to keep watching it after the third episode. Honestly, I'm not a big fan of any of the idol groups of SM, and I didn't really recognise any of them easily, so, for me, this drama is just like any others. The story sounds okay, though the first episode doesn't really explain why the girl chose to dress up as a boy and attend the school. It was hinted that she may have a crush on the lead actor, but she actually hasn't, as it is revealed through the next episodes. She just admires him and wants to help him. Her acting though isn't that good, and the situations where she almost has her identity revealed, which should have been funny and awkward, are just bad. To top that, the romance is bleak, with the two actors showing no attraction for one another. Maybe the only thing that kept me going was actor Hyun-woo Lee, who's one of my favourites, though he even couldn't save this drama. So 2 out of 10.

Honestly, this show is so well done, the humor is visually translated very well. Gotta love clarity in comedy. 'To the Beautiful You', is better than swell, it is smurf-a-liciously good.

Seriously, why don't you find someone who at least can act a little so that I didn't have to pull my hairs in frustration during the whole time watching your show. This show makes no sense at all. The plot is super messy. It's just like they threw a bunch of random things together and hoped it'd work. But it didn't. I don't even know why I wasted my time on it.

Hot off the well received City Hunter series last year, Lee Min Ho has done an excellent job and appears in a role unique to what some of us have seen him do before.Since this IMDb page doesn't list a brief summary, here's a quick breakdown: Choi Young (Lee Min Ho) is a top royal body guard in the 1300s. When the queen suffers a severe injury requiring medical attention beyond their capabilities, it is suggested that they use a mysterious portal-type formation to go to Heaven and find God's doctor. Lee Min Ho is the man for the job. Unknown to these people, the portal actually leads to the future (2012) and the doctor he selected is not God's doctor at all, but rather Yoo Eun-soo (Kim Hee-Sun). With her back in the 1300s, where will the story go?It is well acted, well shot, although there are a few pockets of episodes they might have missed. On the whole, I could see them tightening the series up and bringing it down to, say, 20 episodes and keep the emotion, action, and character development while leaving behind a little of the excess. In spite of some pacing issues, the series finishes well and is very much worth seeing.", "Dear Friends, If you mention my article below, please credit me as the writer. Please do not copy and/or transpose and upload in any form my article without my permission. Many thanks!In memory of Director Kim Jong Hak (4th anniversary, 2016)The place where the tree is located is small. The way the director filmed the scene with the two (Choi Yong and Eun Soo) apart gave it distance and made the place seemed bigger, thus the cinematography became epic. Even though they were not that far away from each other, we would feel that the distance was large. In the scene that we keep playing over and over in our minds, the more we want them to come together, and the fact that they just stand there staring at each other makes the distance between them feel like the distance is even greater and the place larger and thus the scene becomes epic.They are far apart... Many steps, many years, many lifetimes apart\u0085The third element \u2013 a genius at workThe third element is the tension of expectation that something is going to happen, that which we know is going to happen and that we longed for but is actually not there - yet. We know the next frame is what we expect to happen. From an art history studies point of view, this is very Boroque. The third element in the Boroque painting style is the missing part that is the next moment, that which is not in the painting but in the viewer's mind as an expectation and is often dramatically different from what is visible in the painting. This adds depth to the scene as there is a third element in the two dimensional plane. The expectation of a dramatic change to the whole scene makes the scene more emotionally moving and it leaves the viewer a more lasting impression. It evokes a lot more emotion from the viewer because the next moment is elusive. It keeps you thinking and longing for the next moment that follows the scene you are viewing. They will come together. The third element...And because of this third element and the epic scenery, the film reel in our minds will play it over and over - that they were apart but would come together in a very epic and dramatic way. They were finally close, but apart, or they were apart, but would come together. The last scene makes the viewer feel what Choi Yong and Eun Soo had felt in all those lifetimes, years and steps apart.I appreciate what the director had done for the ending. Anyone can do a kissing and hugging scene for the ending. But the director did something extraordinary - powerful, epic, emotional and lasting. He made us feel the frustration, the surprise, the longing, the faithfulness, the patience, the sadness, the joy, the gratefulness, and much more - all the emotions that went through the two characters - all in but one scene. How else would we feel everything that the two characters feel? How else could we have such strong feelings and a long-lasting memory of the story that the director told? That is an unexpected and ingenious way to sum it up and end it for in this way, with the third element at work, it never ends.And this never-ending and looping element is also another theme of the story - how many lifetimes of these two diverged and converged? Based on faith and love?Have you wondered why to this day you still talk about the story, still have strong feelings for the character and still want to view it over and over again? This is why. The third element at work.That was a genius at work. That was beautiful. That was his touch which touched my heart. And I discovered this at the tree.", "This is a drama in which the writer has deftly used the history, mythology, and Korean legends along with a bit of fantasy to weave a beautiful and powerful story.A Tale of Love across Time: The love story of Choi Young and Eun Soo is sure to tug the viewers' heartstrings. This love across centuries, love defying time, will be a hit among romantics. From making her learn the way of their world to protecting her from innumerable death traps, Choi Young is falling for Eun Soo, even though he knows he has to keep his promise to her, to help her return to her world. And Eun Soo changes her perspective from seeing him as her kidnapper to the only one she can trust in the unknown world of past, and to be with him becomes a habit she's reluctant to change. The gradual falling in love is beautifully portrayed in this period drama, while the question 'will she return?' refuses to cease anyone's mind.", "I have come to appreciate the emotions good Korean actors can emit in a scene. This series is so very well done, I'm hoping it continues. I found it on Netflix {I'm not trying to sell Netflix), and was thinking it probably is an adolescent series. It isn't that simple. The subtitles are obviously done by an inexperienced translator, which sometimes is irritating, but also can be very interesting for a native English-speaker. The language the translator uses is very contemporary, using terms like \"punk\" etc., but I imagined from the get-go that there was a meeting of the staff to decide if using contemporary language would add or detract from the series. I believe they made the right decision in one sense because viewers (and most likely they are as adolescent viewers as me, it's true} can get caught up in the exchanges between actors, Min-ho Lee {Choi Young, the general, and Hee-seon Kim {Yoo Eun-Soo, the good doctor} as the love tension between them evolves, and there are some hilarious moments with these two as they struggle to hide their growing love from both themselves and one another. But I'm so curious about the archaic language that I might be missing because that language has always reflected the complex and brutal formality of the ancient cultures of the Asian societies. It's so very Shakespearean in his characters' consistent struggle to find one another in a feudal age where honor is everything to a male. But even with their use of contemporary Korean, I realize at this very instant, the power lies in a mixture of archaic expression with the contemporary \"kids\", \"punks\", etc., showing the exquisite complexity that one simple word can carry in the politics of the mind in a chess game or Go. As the first reviewer has said, it is very obvious the director tightens the series very sublimely as it progresses, moving nicely to much deeper themes than simply a love story or drama. I've been privileged to have seen some of the top actors of the series in other major films, and the impetus created by the story-lines and stylistic methodology compels the viewer to keep watching for the next episodes.I'm amazed by the Korean theatre. It is very well established, and this series makes that obvious. The result makes for scholarly study of such a phenomenon as well as an enjoyable and even emotional/spiritual experience even if it is adolescent at its core. Perhaps I'm simply a 65 year old baby looking at my past remembering in my own melancholy some of the finer things in my life. As a former film maker though, I cannot help but want this show to continue to evolve. So does it matter that perhaps it is a little adolescent while covering a sublime set of universal themes? there's so much more I would like to say here, but I guess I will have to write an essay about it. No room here.", "This is a good series. I wanted most of episodes 1 -12 diligently then skipped to episode 18 or 19 and even then began following the plot but skipping along. Instead of providing high analysis I will just say, I wish the main characters embraced at the very end. To be correct I would have given it an 8.9 out of 10. Will definitely find other Korean movies to watch in future. Did not have the heart or time to thoroughly watch episodes 13-17 as it was more of the back and forth plotting and endangerment stuff. Definitely opened my eyes to some of Korean culture and historical drama. There are no outright make-out scenes, but some of the replay views of the past help to continually reinforce the bond the main characters have built up. I also wish more US/Western or UK stories were told from this perspective- not exclusively first person, always sticking the audience hearing in first person what the main character or characters are feeling.", "Fassbinder's Berlin Alexanderplatz (1980) was a long movie - over 15 hours long. The Thornbirds, Roots and other early TV mini-series were long movies broken into consecutive episodes. I love a mini-series as a melodrama that tells a story in the long movie format, as opposed to those that tell different stories in the same setting (like Grey's Anatomy, Mad Men and to a lesser extent Damages, Breaking Bad, and Revenge that change the story at times while keeping to a general story). In this regard, I have discovered some gems in the South Korean TV mini-series of recent years.The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back. This me recur in the same story. Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved. If personality dynamics are properly depicted in a valid manner, and if the production is skillful, powerful emotions can be evoked in the viewer. In this way we can live many lifetimes through movies, in our one lifetime - greatly enriching our incarnate experience. These South Korean productions (seen on Netflix streaming) are first class with excellent production and direction, some terrific casting and acting (particularly from some of the females who give some matchless world class performances), brilliant musical accompaniment, and staging. What makes these so good is the way they skillfully evoke deep emotion in the viewer. South Korean movie making is superb - world class.However, the following caveats must be considered by the USA viewer. They are subtitled and some people hate this. The South Korean cultural norms, values and sanctions may sometimes seems silly or old fashioned to the USA viewer. The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation/unity - sometimes reminiscence of a old Frank Capra film.Most importantly, in order for the sometimes complicated sub-plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing, and this leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people, that sometimes seem to be unlikely by USA cultural standards. The viewer may wonder at times why good but trusting people are so easily manipulated and deceived by bad and selfish people, but con artists do often succeed (just look at politicians for example). However this poetic license of improbability is needed to develop the story - just accept it as occurring even though unlikely at times. Taking these factors into account Will help you become involved and emotionally engrossed. It was hard t for me to quit watching at times so I binged watched.I would rank these as follows but tastes differ and your rankings might not agree: 1 - 4 (hard to say which is best)Shining InheritanceWhen a Man LovesThat Winter, The Wind BlowsSecret garden5.

See J. Randles book, Time Slips, for more on this.

A romantic and solving one. Enjoy!", "I am not a big fan of Hollywood and being an Indian I cannot watch the crap on Indian television either. I envy Koreans as they are blessed with good quality entertainment all the time, be it movies or Dramas. Sometimes I feel Dramas are better than movies as they have same good acting but with more plot and good character growth. For a woman like me Korean dramas are as exciting as Japanese Anime for boys. This show, Faith, is a mixture of every genre of film you can think of: Sci-fi, Historical, Romance, comedy, drama, suspense, thrill, action, warrior-samurai-ass-kicking, even X-men! You name it and the show has on it's basket. The story takes place in the era of King Gongmin when his beloved wife Noguk was gravely injured. The officials advised the king to follow the footsteps of a mythical heavenly-doctor Hwata and find him from the heaven. They thus move to the mountain where Hwata had disappeared a 1000 years ago and find a magical portal. Most people are afraid to cross the portal, at which point the bravest warrior of the lot, Choi Yong decides to cross the door. He crosses the portal and reaches to today's world. It was actually a time-traveling wormhole which left him to current world where he looks for a heavenly doctor. Choi Young sees the lights and prosperity and believes this world to be heaven. He then kidnaps Eun Soo, a talkative plastic surgeon (who was actually a general surgeon before) to the Goreyo era. Eun Soo believes it to be a drama set at first, then a dream. Gradually she adjusts to the world. To her shock she finds that she is stuck with the real Gongmin, Noguk and the well known General Choi Young Do, who are themselves amidst a severe power struggle to establish the kingdom. Gongmin is remembered to have brought the biggest reforms in Korean History, at a time when Goreyo was under Yuan and was in a state of turmoil. Eun Soo witnesses the history unfold before her eyes, which is almost like a dream. But funny though, she is also the one who knows what's gonna happen next. Hence people hunt her for knowing the future. Choi Young and the King and Queen try their best to protect Eun Soo. The series focuses on that era's politics and the battle to keep Eun Soo safe amidst all of it. Choi Young fights with his life to protect her as he gradually starts falling in love with her. He can't help but he gets over his past scruples which had turned him into a tough and reckless warrior. The series is about all that, love and yearning for the loved one. Acting is marvelous. Lee Min Ho who portrays the rigid Choi Young Do enacts the part so effortlessly that you feel you are transported to their world. His eyes talk, literally. He doesn't speak much. Its amazing as I still remember in his spoiled-kid avatar in Boys Over Flower. His versatility is commendable. In this show he so mature. His samurai-like warrior getup and body language gives you a fresh feel of a brand new world which is... sexy. Kim Hee Seon as Eun Soo is great too. But I slightly feel she was overdoing her kiddish expressions. She is very mature and I think on a subconscious level she was hesitating to do those child-like things and they seemed rather forced. Even her chemistry with Lee Min Ho was a bit lacking. However I loved the way she enacted the emotional scenes. I feel the editing was not that up to the mark, with wrong background music for wrong scenes. Also the X-men family was bit over the top, to the extent of being annoying and I actually had to skip their segments. They were just too much Manga-themed for a romantic show. However I really liked the white-haired flute man, he was really scary and cool. Overall I loved the show even with the flaws. Those who love Lee Min Ho will enjoy the show thoroughly. And even those who don't know Lee Min Ho will enjoy the show just because of his sheer brilliance. As I say, his eyes talk a lot. He can deliver ten dialogues in a row without blinking his eyes and can make you wonder if it was real. He is a brilliant actor and his acting in this show is top-notch. A welcome change for people who think Hollywood has better acting and content. To be honest, I am bored of Hollywood actors' wooden faces. They are always stoned I feel. And I have no hopes from Bollywood or Hindi TV industry. I have been watching Korean shows from a long time now. Shinui/Faith is one of my favorite.", "SPOILER ALERT!!! After watching this series for about 5 times! (Yeah I know! I am a Kdrama fan :P ) I have come to this conclusion: In her first life Eun Soo went back in time where Choi Young was killed by the ambush set by he evil uncle of the king, so she wrote down the whole incident in her diary and went through the portal that send her further back in time.In her second life Eun Soo went back in time where after finding the previous pages of the diary saved Choi Young from the ambush that had killed him the previous time only for him to be driven crazy with guilt after the queen was killed by the evil uncle of the king when he abducted her, she then had to leave him and traveled further back in time where she also wrote this incident to her diary.In her third life Eun Soo went back in time, saved Choi Young from the ambush of the evil uncle, saved the queen from the evil uncle and then went further back in time, because she was ambushed, only to be reunited with our sweetheart Choi Young in the heartfelt end of the series.We can only assume that the fourth time she would have written what had happened the third time and avoided the crazy heaven-citizen- wannabe.I feel like the whole concept of this series is that everyone's lives had already been, and we have to live again, and again the same life for eternity, and that is why Eun Soo has written so many \"BE CAREFUL! DANGER\" pages about Choi Young because of the fact that every time she \"lives\" she adds a little something to that diary.I would have loved to see my sweetheart Lee Goon Ji in the main role, had it not been for his military service, but I found Lee Min Ho just as gorgeous. That's all from me! I hope I was somewhat understandable! :)"], "794": ["Maybe this should become my mantra: \"The property of 'originality' is based not so much on actual properties of the art object in question as it is based on the knowledge of the person ascribing the property to the art object in question\". In other words, when we deem an artwork \"original\", it doesn't so much mean that the work _is_ original as it means that we're just not familiar with the works that have had a significant influence on it, or we do not remember the precursors (for those of us with less than perfect memories . . . what was I saying?)The Quiet Family has already had a significant influence on films such as Jaume Balaguer\u00f3's The Darkness (2002), and it has already been remade, by wacky Japanese director Takashi Miike, as The Happiness of the Katakuris (Katakuri-ke no k\u00f4fuku, 2001). I didn't realize that Happiness of the Katakuris was a remake of this film until I watched Happiness and looked it up on IMDb. I had never heard of this film before. South Korean films do not exactly get a great amount of publicity in the U.S., unfortunately.Unlike Miike's remake, which is a very good film in its own right, The Quiet Family doesn't have bizarre claymation, it's not a musical, there aren't singing and \"dancing\" zombie-corpses, and there isn't some karmic disturbance of an equivalent to Mt. Fuji. This is a much quieter and understated film, but it's still a \"black\" (morbid or macabre) comedy-drama about a horrific, bad situation that just keeps getting worse.The story concerns Tae-gu Kang, who has bought a small hotel (unlike Happiness of the Katakuris' much simpler bed & breakfast) in a relatively remote hiking area. He moves his family--his wife, son, two daughters and his brother--to the hotel, where they wait for guests to arrive. No one shows up. When they eventually do get a guest, it's a strange, solitary, older man who ends up committing suicide with his hotel key chain. The man's wallet, which seemed to contain a substantial sum of cash, is missing. Worried that the authorities will never believe them that it was a suicide, especially given their son's troubled past, and worried that the situation will create bad publicity for their hotel, they decide to bury the body on their property. Other guests begin trickling in, but for some reason or another, they all meet less than favorable fates. Just how much bad luck will the Kangs have, and just how far will they go to surmount it? Even though this is a morbid comedy, director Ji-woon Kim employs very deliberate \"art-house drama\" pacing and tonalities. The cinematography is interesting throughout, and recurrent motifs include sustained, almost motionless shots of daughter Mi-na Kang (Ho-kyung Go), who is implied as an emotional \"center\" for the family (and indeed, she's the only one who remains relatively even-keeled throughout the bizarre occurrences). There are also many slow tracking or zoom shots of the beautifully decorated and colored hallways of the hotel (this is one of the conspicuous influences on the film Darkness, which has similar color and decoration schemes).Another \"center\" for the Kangs is mealtime. We see them eating many times throughout the film--it's a way for them to gather their bearings, if possible, and figure out their \"plan of attack\". One nicely symbolic scene shows everyone refraining from eating at the table except for Mi-na and her sister Mi-su (Yun-seong Lee), as the family initially keeps the girls in the dark about the macabre goings-on.Kim, who also wrote The Quiet Family in addition to directing, even spoofs the typical art-house drama romance, with a man who courts Mi-su a little too fervently and of course meets a twisted fate. This sets off a chain of events that lead to a very funny climax.The crux of the film is the ever-escalating occurrences and humorous attempts to cover them up. This provides amusing subtexts about how good intentions can lead to severely immoral actions (and the guests even get in on this subtext a bit), but at the same time, we empathize with the protagonists, as the Kangs, at least, may be making bad judgments, but if they don't, they could face worse consequences. This is a quiet family that wants to remain quiet. While I prefer the bizarreness of Happiness of the Katakuris, at least slightly, The Quiet Family is still a very good film, and you just might prefer it if your tastes lean more towards art-house dramas than the surreal and over-the-top.", "When a family reluctantly becomes proprietors of an inn deep in the woods, it seems doubtful anyone could find their way there. It doesn't help that the family ends up killing nearly all of their guests -- usually under cover of night (and the blackest possible humor). Imagine Hitchcock's \"The Trouble with Harry\" steered by a gruesomely dysfunctional family, and you have some idea of what this deadpan South Korean film offers. Still more evidence of that country's continuing film renaissance, and easily up to the standard of the best American films.", "I can't account for the lackluster ratings for this on IMDB (though its primary domestic distribution right now is bootleg video, which might account for something.) I saw it at the movies, and it rates as one of the great South Korean black comedies. A bit like Hitchcock, this tells the story of a family that takes over an inn deep, deep in the country - only realizing when they get there it was a big mistake. For one thing, they're miles from any human being. Things take a turn for the macabre when their visitors and guests end up dying under ambiguous circumstances, and the family has to find some way of disposing of the bodies before the cops roll in. Of course, they eventually do come to investigate, making the tale even more twisted than it was before.Don't let any prejudices against South Korean cinema keep you away; at its best, their film output is second to none, and attracts international favor from film festivals and critics. This film is one of the unequivocal winners.", "This is Kim Ji-woon's debut film. He would go on to direct A Tale of Two Sisters, The Good, The Bad, the Weird and I Saw the Devil. The Quiet Family is probably most famous for being remade by Takashi Miike a few years later as The Happiness of the Katakuris. Miike's film is far more zany, and it's a ton of fun. Kim's film is probably a little bit better. It doesn't contain any musical numbers, zombies or sequences animated in clay. It's quite well directed, though there are some plot holes and loose threads. Kang-ho Song (Thirst, The Host) and Min-sik Choi (Oldboy, Failan) are the most recognizable of the five family members who own a remote mountain inn. Their business is doing poorly. After a few weeks, their first customer shows up. He dies. Probably a suicide, but it looks like murder. The family decides to bury them. More bad luck follows as nearly each and every guest who shows up at the inn dies under horrific circumstances. The family just keeps burying the bodies. The film is morbidly hilarious. It kind of gets sloppy around the end, but it's hugely amusing the whole way through. Probably my favorite of Kim's films that I've seen so far", "This film manages to strike a very tricky balance between humor and suspense.  It's funny and tense all at the same time, from start to finish.It's visually appealing, with interesting characters, and high production values.  The acting is uniformly superb, and the plot manages to incorporate good, old fashioned suspense traditions and tropes while remaining fresh and interesting.If you get a chance to see this, do.", "A South Korean family (dad, mom, uncle, son, and two teen daughters) moves to the woods to open up a lodge in a hiking area. They find themselves restless, anxiously awaiting their first customer. When they finally get one, he is later found dead in his room. The family covers it up to avoid bad publicity. Soon the business finally starts booming--and so does the body count! This story probably sounds familiar to fans of Asian horror. That's because Takashi Miike remade this into \"Happiness of the Katakuris,\" with song and dance sequences, zombies and claymation. \"The Quiet Family\" contains none of these elements, but it is almost as delightful with its wicked sense of humor. Each family member (my favorite being Mom) has their own amusing quirks, and I found myself chuckling out loud for the first half hour. Even when the story delves into morbid territory, the silly characters still manage to provide the laughs. Watching a \"normal\" family react to very abnormal situations proves to be very funny. The pace is excellent, though a few of the subplots almost push the story into a ridiculous place.Ji-woon Kim is also the director of the instant classic \"A Tale of Two Sisters.\" As with that film, the set design, use of rich colors, and innovative camera-work are spectacular and largely responsible for the eerie atmosphere.\"The Quiet Family\" borders on absurd, but it never fails to entertain. Despite its over-the-top comedy and ridiculous scenarios, it has a serious overall tone that sets it apart from most other horror/comedies.My Rating: 7/10.", "The storyline:  A Korean family bought a lodging hotel for bargain basement prices in a desolated location.  Hotel guests were hard to come by but when the first guest finally arrived, he committed suicide.  More guests started to show up... but things did not turn out the way they were hoping...  A classic case of be careful what you wish for, because it may actually come true in unexpected ways...Think of this as Korean version of the \"Addams Family\".  This movie is a showcase of dark humor while several parallel subplots are going on.  I especially like the acting of the youngest daughter Mi-na, her looks and mannerism epitomize the dark humor of the entire movie.Not the funniest movie to come out from the Korea movie industry in recent years, but nonetheless quite enjoyable for those who like dark humor movies like Beetlejuice or Addams Family.", "This film is incredibly dynamic. There are multiple concepts at once. It's a horror film yet it's a tragic-comedy. It's a drama yet it's almost a documentary. It's a great film concept and the cinematography is second to none.It's very slow yet instantly jerks into action. It's got great casting. The actors are flawless. Even down to 5minute appearances. The score is first class and diverse. Rock-glam from the Stray Cats to hip hop. The setting is also a little interesting.It's based in a remote area outside some woods. There is scheduled yet delayed construction for a \"road\" which will provide transportation for guests to the inn. However during the film the inn guests are mainly hikers and scenic people.The opening of the film involves this new family moving into a little run down house. They prepare the house and botch it up ready for guests. They have minimum advertising which is a sign. Literally. They wait for the guests to arrive. This opening scene is lighthearted and slow.Then the guests eventually arrive. All hell breaks loose. There is a moment of continuous bad luck from the moment the first guest arrives. This is when the film turns to film noir. All in all the film goes from an easy melodrama to something completely insane. It's a marvelous script and the slowness is rewarded by great tense sequences and various dilemmas for the unfortunate home owners.The film is superb. The casting spot on. The cinematography is awesome. A lot of different shots and slow camera movement to mimic the pace of the film. Then the unfortunate sequences occur the camera shots become more rapid and quick snappy close ups. I'm a big fan of this director and this film has to be his benchmark with the diverse range on offer.All in all a great film worth tracking down. Comedy; film noir, suspense, horror, isolation and deprivation. Superb acting and direction to match. I recommend it fully. 8 out of 10.", "A very amusing and very black comedy, that plays on the failings of different family members, all trying to run a lodge in the middle of nowhere. A good amount of suspense is combined with the laughs, the film mixing a comedy of errors with slapstick and (many) bloody corpses. Wicked fun definitely not for the whole family.", "This is probably one of the reasons why the new wave of Korean cinema got so popular, it is funny and the production values are high, it is also quite bizarre.A family buys a lodging facility in the mountains, but are struck with bad luck and bad business. A depressed man comes and suicides in the room, and when they don't find his wallet they decide, to not be suspected themselves of killing him, to just bury him. Wise choice. Soon problems heap up way over what they can handle.Choi Min-shik definitely matured from this and on to 'Failan', but all actors does a reasonably good job here.", "Kim Jee-woon's feature film debut is a fresh, funny & flavourful horror comedy that makes terrific use of its genre(s) elements to deliver plenty of thrills & laughs, and is wonderfully steered by its faithful ensemble that includes both Choi Min-sik & Song Kang-ho before their stardom.The story concerns an extended family that owns a hunting lodge in a remote area. When their very first customer commits suicide, the family buries his body to avoid bad publicity. But it is only the beginning of their misfortune as more of their guests befall horrible fates, leaving the family to handle the situation themselves.Written & directed by Kim Jee-woon, the film quickly establishes the family dynamic before the main plot surfaces and even infuses a hint of something sinister brewing at the place. But once the bodies start piling up, the comedic aspects take over the narrative and is utilised so well that the rest of the ride is jam-packed with hilarity.The morbid humour is derived from the family's misfortune & their frantic actions to rectify the situation. Dialogues are sharp & zany, characters are idiosyncratic, and the family's continuous attempts to get rid of the dead bodies keeps the plot moving & engaging at all times. The twists & turns are predictable yet quite fun to watch.The remote location of the lodge surrounded by nothing but wilderness provides just the right setting for its plot to unfurl. Camerawork is smooth & controlled throughout as it helps in building tension which is then broken by the delectable wit. Editing isn't an issue either, pacing the plot at a steady rate and keeping the amusement alive & kicking at all times.Coming to the performances, The Quiet Family features Park In-hwan, Na Moon-hee, Choi Min-sik, Song Kang-ho, Go Ho-kyung & Lee Yoon-seong as the Kang family, and everyone plays their roles responsibly. But it's Song Kang-ho who steals the show, for every scene featuring him is a delight as the then-new actor delivers a rib-tickling showcase that only gets better with time.On an overall scale, The Quiet Family marks an impressive start to Kim Jee-woon's filmmaking career and has aged really well over the years. Kim's direction exhibits a calculative approach that keeps looking for humour in every situation, and the end result is a genuinely impressive debut feature. An essential step in the rise of Kim Jee-woon, Song Kang-ho & Choi Min-sik, The Quiet Family is one of South Korean cinema's funniest offerings. Don't miss it.", "I chanced upon this gem of a movie while Googling for Asian horror classics. By no stretch of imagination can this be described as a horror movie. It is a black comedy, which becomes truly hilarious as it progresses. Each character is unique, dead-pan and allegorical. The film is fast paced, suspenseful and full of sudden twists and turns, which leave the viewer baffled. The cast is perfect - from the landlord, to the landlady, the daughters, the son, uncle and the guests, which include a professional killer, an under-cover policeman, North Korean 'spies' and such-like, all of whom met bizarre ends, due to twists of fate. I do not blame North Korea, envying South Korea, for producing such gems :-)Highly recommended.", "'The Quiet Family's' concept is better known in Miike's remake which is a shame because while the Japanese counterpart is a masterpiece in its own right the original movie needs not be compared; it stands as a pearl of dark comedy. The mood is full of suspense as the Kang family is visited by misfortune upon misfortune. Morbid humor sets the tone of a very tight story and some typical comic tropes are adapted to fit the overall feeling of stress as things get out of control. The cinematography is understated but highly competent with an emphasis on indoor scenes that add to the claustrophobia of the situation.Off beat and tense, the movie's aesthetics are close to the noir genre. It never degenerates into nonsense territory and much of its entertainment value resides on how believable the characters' reactions are. This quiet family systematically makes the wrong choice that of course leads to further complications but the entire insanity is understandable and made more hilarious for that. A grim fatalism pervades everything as if for all their mistakes the Kangs are indeed cursed.On top of the freak deaths, the scrambling for hiding dead bodies, the crossing the line into crime, the movie is true to its title: a portrait of a family that would rather live in peace. Their struggle for keeping their both their livelihood and quiet walks a very thin line as far as morals go but the family unit is so tightly knit that somehow overrides this. The finale brings this home in a simple and effective manner. Cleverly plotted and with solid performances all around, 'The Quiet Family' should be seen by anyone willing to be amused by something different.", "Well, I just finished watching this film and my feelings toward it are a little mixed. I had been told to expect dark humor and I wasn't let down. There is a lot of dark humor in this movie about a dysfunctional family trying to make a living in an old inn out on a not-so-well-traversed mountain where a major road is expected to be built. Of course, this family ends up going from mishap to mishap, and throughout most of it, the two daughters are quite oblivious of what the rest of their family is doing.The first sense of foreboding comes from a blabbering old woman the youngest daughter and uncle assume to be crazy. Then after that, things start to happen, starting with a possible suicide in one of the rooms that leads into more mishaps, misunderstandings, and murder. But throughout all this, the comedy is definitely there.However, my main problem with it was the youngest daughter and her strange attitude throughout the movie. She seemed completely disconnected throughout most of the film, and while for some parts this may have been funny, for others it was just downright awful. I suppose that's why she was considered to be weird (well, the whole family is very weird!).Not the best comedy ever, but certainly good to watch.", "I previously reviewed \"The Happiness of the Katakuris\" and have recommended it to all my friends. It's a wonderfully strange concoction from Takashi Miike--the Japanese director who seems quite adept in many genres. The film is a wacky fantasy musical--complete with dancing zombies, significant portions done in claymation as well as a Japanese man who claims to be Queen Elizabeth's unknown child who ALSO works for the CIA! It's strange beyond belief, but it also manages to be a heartfelt family movie that strongly advocates traditional values...and LOTS of accidental deaths. Imagine my surprise, then, when he told me that this film is NOT an original but was first made in South Korea as \"The Quiet Family\"! Naturally I HAD to see this original and fortunately he sent me a copy! I was so excited to see this film that I could practically burst!When the film begins, you might also think this South Korean film is a musical--as it begins with a weird hip-hop version of an old Herb Alpert song from the 1960s! And, oddly, throughout the film there are a lot of odd American tunes--including one from the Partridge Family. BUT, and this is important, it was NOT a musical--and this was very disappointing. In the Miike film, there were dancing zombies and other wondrous musical delights. But none of this is in The Quiet Family. I could live with this...though I missed the zombies. But what I couldn't believe was that this dark comedy really wasn't all that funny. Yes, it had an original idea but it clearly did NOT make the most of it. Miike and his writers clearly were able to transform a rather average comedy into gold--and often that meant significantly changing the original script.Like the remake, the film is about a family that owns a small hotel in the middle of nowhere. Because of this, their business is failing--as the long-promised new highway has yet to be built and they have no customers for the longest time. Then, out of the blue, comes the first customer and the family is ecstatic. However, when they check on their guest the next morning, they find that the man had killed himself in the room...and he'd used his room key to do the deed! Fearing that this awful exposure would kill any chance at making the business a success, they decide to bury the body. Guess what happens with the hotel's next guests? Yep...they die as well. And, since they've already buried one guest, burying a couple more won't be so bad...right?!At this point, the plot of the two films are very, very similar--though the deaths of the guests in \"The Quiet Family\" aren't really that funny- -but they sure are in \"The Happiness of the Katakuris\". This sort of trend continues through the film, as often the South Korean film fails to capitalize on potentially darkly funny situations. Additionally, the film makes a huge mistake later--it does not keep the viewer liking the innocent family who just want to make a go of their new business. Instead, some of the family members are pretty awful and so loses its charm and slowly fizzles. While \"The Quiet Family\" is not a bad film, it is a definite disappointment considering that I first saw the PERFECT remake. The bottom line is that this is just a very rare case of a film where the remake is much, much better--funnier and actually much more original because of all the insane things they interject into the old plot. I almost always prefer the originals unless there is a serious flaw in it. In the case of \"The Quiet Family\", there were several serious flaws.", "First they have no customers, than they all die. And how to get rid of them when you are not used to it? In the end, the family which runs a hotel in the woods is threatened by itself. For some, those funny and horrifying events are just too much. From the distributor of THE SOUL GUARDIANS, a clear must for all phantasy genre fans and friends of SCREAM(s). I saw the movie on Mailand's MIFED (the film fair), my colleague Ivo was quite interested to buy it for the German DVD-market. Besides, we were both attached by Ilshin Investment Co.'s female representative  Lady Suh who taught me how to hand over a business card correctly: with both hands. Believe me, the killing in THE QUIET FAMILY was much more western style ;-)", "Lately, a lot of people have been getting into Korean cinema and enjoying the fact that they have made some absolutely amazing films as recently (Chingoo, JSA, Failan, etc.). However, this film is definitely not one of them. I was sorely disappointed; it did not seem to have the wit and spunk that was injected into Korean film as of late. You can definitely tell that the real foundation for this film is not Korean, but rather ... Koreans copying the Japanese. That is why I would like to pose the question to those involved in the production of this film -- why did you make this mistake? The story, the portrayal, the acting, the cinematography... All of it... Not worthy of watching. A poor job all-around, and poor results only to show for it. The Korean-style that you normally see in Korean cinema is obviously missing, and nothing in the film even begins to make up for it.If you want to see Korean film, and enjoy Korean cinema, this is not the film for you to watch. I would tell all people to happily skip over it -- this is not Korean cinema, this is something else.", "Directed by Jee-woon Kim A family decides to buy a lodge in a remote hiking area.

And incidentally this was his FIRST FEATURE FILM DEBUT.The acting is top notch, all the characters have their own quirky traits and the incidences in the film just continue to get magnanimous...Is there a moral to this film? I think there is! Its for you to find out dear viewer.Plot: An extended family has moved from the city (presumably Seoul) to live in a large house out in the mountains, which they convert into a lodge for hikers. Consisting of a middle aged father Kang Dae-Goo (Park In-Hwan), mother Jeong Soon-Ryae (Na Moon-Hee), Dae-Goo's younger brother Kang Chang-Goo (played by Choi Min-sik), and their adult children Kang Young-Min (played by Song Kang-ho), Kang Mi-Soo (Lee Yoon-Seong) and Kang Mina (played by Go Ho-Kyung) they suffer a string of misfortunes as various patrons come to stay.Their first guest, a hiker, asks for a room and three beers. Left to himself, he spends the night forging his room key holder to be sharp enough to stab himself and is found dead the next morning. The father of the family decides on burying the body in the woods, under the assumption that no one would believe this to be a suicide. Later, a young couple drops in for a stay to have sex in the privacy of their room and end up dead together the next morning. A pair of friends from town stop by for drinks until one of the men falls for Mi-Soo and subsequently attempts to rape her, but she is saved by Young-Min, who accidentally ends up pushing the man off a cliff, while his friend is taken captive by the family to prevent him from calling the police.Mr. Park, the benefactor of the family (providing them the house) later asks for their lodging for his younger (and illegitimate) half sister to have a hit-man check into the neighboring room at midnight and murder her so he can be the only successor to claim inheritance of the soon profitable land. Uninformed of the plan, Uncle Kang senses foul play and sends the half sister home to Seoul when she is found to be restless. The plan goes further awry when the hit-man arrives fifteen minutes late, and the room had been taken by an undercover cop investigating the recent string of missing people, mistaken to be the hit-man. The hit-man thus ends up killing the cop instead, and later gets killed by a suspicious Young-Min.A heavy rainstorm overnight nearly uncovers the buried corpses by morning, leaving the family no choice but to incinerate them. When uncle returns from the trip to Seoul, he angers Dae-Goo who had hoped to settle Mr. Park's plot without any trouble. A fight ensues as uncle is beaten senseless but is saved from a blow to the head by Young-Min who then trips, hitting his head on the stairs, he is whisked to the hospital, leaving the elderly parents the only ones left to finish the job. The local man, having been imprisoned, bound and gagged, tries to make his escape but gets his ropes tangled in several trees as he escapes the lodge.Soon enough, Mr. Park drops in unannounced to check if his sister-in-law has been terminated as planned, but is in complete shock when he sees Mr. Kang and Mrs. Jeong carrying the corpse of the undercover cop, knowing that he wasn't the hit-man. A brief struggle begins when Mr. Park tries to escape without trying to figure out just what exactly has happened, and ends after he accidentally falls to his death down the stairs, adding yet another body to be done away with for the family.To drive away attention, Mrs. Jeong switches off the circuits throughout the lodge and outside storage where she and her husband are piling the corpses, dousing them in gasoline. Mina, trying to watch TV, asks for Uncle Kang to switch the circuits back on, inadvertently causing a socket in the storage to burst in flames, triggering the cremation fire prematurely, trapping the parents inside. Meanwhile, Young-Min is in the hospital recovering from his concussion and laughing insanely over a news report on the shooting of a North Korean agent wandering through the forest.After an uncertain amount of time later, Uncle Kang, Young-Min, Mi-Soo, and Mina are preparing to serve dinner, totally unaware of the fire in the storage building. The parents return, in bandages, having survived the fire. Without a single word, the family quietly has dinner until there is a sudden knock at the door. Unsure of what to do, they all stand quietly in the doorway of the dining room, waiting for whoever is at the door to go away. When the dog starts barking at the knocking, the family, in unison hushes the dog; they have become the quiet family.The film ends with a wide shot of the lodge in winter, with Mina outside, looking at it, and then to the camera with an uncertain look on her face; all to the sound of The Partridge Family's \"I Think I Love You\".Verdict: Just BUY IT!!! P.S: I also recommend you see I Saw The Devil(2010) and A Tale of Two Sisters(2003) both directed by Kim Ji-woon.", "Choyonghan kajok is quite original and weird black comedy. Choyonghan kajok, like a lot of Korean movies is quite gruesome in nature, though the recent Korean movies have surpassed it by a huge margin. This movie has Min-sik Choi in a good role, but nowhere near the greatness of his more recent roles. Everybody else has done a fine job, but nobody really stands out.Choyonghan kajok is about a family own a lodge in a remote area. When there first customer dies they decide to bury him to avoid publicity. But things just go on escalating. Choyonghan kajok has a fresh premise and keeps the audience hooked in throughout. A Nice Effort.", "Death, in some form, was always going to worm its way to the secluded motel the Kang family run in 1998 South Korean film The Quiet Family. Where bloody situational comedy rules the roost for the best part of about an hour or so in Ji-woon Kim's film about a luckless family, stylised neo noir takes over, shoving the film onto a higher realm of cause and effect whilst effectively further involving an even larger number of parties, when the inclusion of hit men and organised killings on those staying at said place of rest. The film treads a fine line between effective black comedy and grossly misguided misfire, the crucial difference being that the deaths are not the focal point of whatever laughs you'll garner out of it; rather, the resulting actions that the innocents caught up in the middle of it all undertake, in order to try and rectify said situations. Importantly, we're on the Kang family's side; a large group of people running a new motel in a secluded woodland area trying to get by in their new business venture and succeed at a sort of American Dream. When tenants turn up, and more often than not need to be carried out rather than anything else, the film has fun with its premise of this rag tag bunch of people completely ill attuned to death or murder, just wanting to get by with this new business acquisition being plunged into a scenario far grimmer.Mi-Soo (Lee Yoon-Seong) appears to be out guide, beginning as our narrator as the figure of her lounging on a sofa the subject of the first instance of an eerie, swooping camera composition which will periodically litter the rest of the film. She's restless of the Americanised hip-hop music that plays, informs us of the supposedly cursed rest place the lodge is and ever so fleetingly glances at the camera in a slight instance of the fourth wall being broken. The rest of the Kangs wait impatiently for a lodger of any kind to christen the place of business; and when a hiker arrives, they fawn over the signing of his name in the register in a close to all but eerily leering manner. The discovery of his dead body the following morning as a result of a suicide kicks off a string of deaths of guests which leave the family floundering as to what they ought to do and why what's happening to them is happening.In what would be seen as quite daft in most other films, but here delivered with a knowing nod, a wondering and rambling elderly woman claims to be able to see a sort of angel of death figure perched on the roof of the lodging premises, invisible, of course, to everyone else. The angel of death claim provides a mythical and unseen element to proceedings, the film's reoccurring use of that long; tracking composition might be seen as this supposed angel's perspective, an escalated point of view on proceedings which allows an outsider to observe what is happening to the Kang family whilst remaining entirely invisible, mirroring the audience's own point of spectatorship on the happenings. Indeed, a while into the piece a number of characters set up a camp fire beside a tree; the camera slowly coming back down from an oddly positioned angle on a tree branch down to ground level so as to form a more normalised composition on the ground, and cover the ensuing chaos that is born out of the result of this camp fire exchange. As if a strange casting of a spell on those involved in the scene has been completed and then a moving down to ground level so as to observe the chaos, as perpetrated by this so called angel, which then plays out.Oddly, most of the early deaths are linked in some shape or form to sexual escapades. Certainly, of those that die so early on are in some form linked to sexual encounters. There is a couple whom stay there and make love before killing themselves by way of pills and later on, an attempted rape on Mi-Soo is thwarted by a family member resulting in the death of the perpetrator. Much has been written of sexual escapades in certain films of the horror genre ultimately leading to a character's demise in what is an almost ritualistic procession of skin and flesh followed by blood and guts. Here, Kim has a couple that make love prior to killing themselves but it sees him render the sex itself the ritualistic act \u2013 a final action in each of their lives before a death they brought upon themselves.From here, the imprisonment of the rapist's travelling partner takes the idea of being lumbered with the body of somebody you don't want, and spins it so that the person this time is still alive, but unable to alert the authorities, thus effectively escalating the chaos without veering too far away from its foundations. There can be little doubt that the writer/director Kim realises running the film on the off beat premise isn't enough, and suddenly decides to throw in a plot to do with the organised murdering of someone which would greatly benefit a certain Mr. Park, the lodge benefactor, within the field of insurance. The tale to do with an assassin; a police officer and a case of mistaken identity isn't exactly of the Coen brothers mould, but it isn't far off. This, as a nearby construction site allows the film to further inflict pain on its leads as it forces the family to reverse the agonising process of burying the dead bodies in excavating them so as not to allow the builders to find them. From its early tale of extraordinary things happening to ordinary people to its comedic content running on a catalyst of mistaken identity, The Quiet Family is a rare off-beat film which doesn't annoy nor outstay its welcome.", "The Quiet Family is Kim Jiwoon's debut feature. Having had much appreciation for his later works, I thought I'd track down his earliest one to see if he had it from the start. Crafting a somewhat black comedy about a family that runs a struggling lodge in the woods, I have to say that he largely succeeded.The story is about the titular family, who have yet to have a guest. Of course, as it turns out, their first few guests happen to have a habit of perishing. A series of increasingly trouble cover-ups and escalations occur until all hell breaks loose. And sure, that sounds pretty vague, but while the film isn't terribly laugh out loud, I do have to admit I was well engaged and amused during the majority of it. I think the strength of the films lies in its suspense: we empathize with the family and despite their bad decisions leading to some of their troubles, their mostly hard luck cases and so we struggle with them as they try to keep their inn running amidst the increasing body count.I think there is a weakness and it's that the epilogue, although amusing, is a bit logically distorted. It's like a twist that was aborted, leading to a rather nonsensical sense. Sort of takes the air out of the film.Actor's all do an impressive job, really, and their chemistry with each other is great. Their ability to deliver the rather straight-faced brand of humor necessary for this kind of comedy helps keep the edge in the blackness of the comedy and lend to the believability of the story. Production values are a little weak, being a film shot before the industry burst open in Corea, however, the direction and art of the film is unmistakably strong and helps give the film an air of aesthetic strength that it might not have had otherwise.Kim's film is rather entertaining and while it won't please those who don't like black comedies, it's otherwise a sometimes suspenseful, mostly amusing and surprisingly engaging piece. Like Kim's other films, it doesn't aim at art cinema, but rather appears to be a strong distillation and synthesis of the dark/horror-comedy genre. And for that, I can recommend it. 8/10."], "795": [], "796": [], "797": [], "798": ["Reply 1997 aka Answer me/to 1997. Korean TV drama. 16 Episodes. Summer of 2012.SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: Teenagers go through their final school years on the way to young adulthood. As adults, they reconvene in 2012 for their 15 year class reunion; while there, they all reflect on their past while their history together unfolds via back story. It's primarily a life story drama about growing up.A half dozen high school kids or so are focused on throughout this show (some more than others), along with one young teacher, and one set of parents. The vast majority of the story is told from 1997 to 1999 and takes place against the backdrop of the birth of K-Pop. The kids meet at high school, become friends, experience awkward first loves, graduate, drift apart, move on in life, etc...The remainder of the story flashes forward in time periodically until it arrives at the present, where you eventually get to see what happened to everybody involved.KTV shows come & go at such a rapid fire pace that it's virtually impossible for a viewer to figure out what's actually going to be good and what's not until a show is well into its compressed run time. Fortunately, it's fairly easy to determine if a show will be suitable to your own personal tastes right away, and I must say I quickly developed a fondness for this particular one. \"Reply 1997\" doesn't have an overly famous cast, a huge budget, or a massive pre-air marketing campaign to prop it up, so it has to work a little a harder to prove itself, and figure out how to find an audience along the way. It basically has to rely on smart storytelling, and subsequent word-of-mouth, in order to be successful, and it did all of this, and then some, really well.Clearly, the best thing this show has going for it is its creativity and intelligence. It's quite well written, and the way it implements a multiple time line is highly effective; subtle hints are dropped at the current day dinner party during each episode, then it flashes back to the past to see how things came to be in the present. This method of storytelling serves to successfully further the plot while keeping you interested in the story & characters along the way. This show also refuses to pander to viewers; it's completely devoid of one-note characters and typical antagonists, and it does not rely on being overly formulaic (which is a frequent problem that is inherent to this industry). Its willingness to openly deal with oft addressed topics in a thoughtful, and often hilarious, manner is rather impressive as well.The late '90s/early K-Pop theme is frequently focused on throughout this show, despite the fact that it's somewhat irrelevant to the true heart of the story. This is all implemented exceptionally well however, and while this show could have succeeded without it, it is certainly better off for including it. There's a good deal of nostalgia involved as a result (from an array of props, to the soundtrack of that era, to cameos, period references, and so on), and, everything is nicely woven together into one seamless tale; none of it ever feels out of place, or tacked on, just for the sake of making it part of the overall story. The cast is pretty solid at getting their jobs done, and they're all afforded well rounded roles. While not unrecognizable to most fans of the Korean entertainment industry, this is primarily a very youthful cast without years & years of experience in this field. Several of them are current K-Pop industry crossover stars as well, and the irony of having several actual K-Pop idols portraying high school kids obsessed with K-Pop is not lost on me. The lead role is reserved for Jung Eun-ji (of APink fame); she could use a little more seasoning going forward as a drama star, but she is way ahead of the curve already and makes for an oddly charismatic and impressive young actress for someone who's relatively new at this. Everybody gave nice performances throughout, and they were equally believable as both high school kids and their future 30 year old counterparts. The two parents are even given diverse parts as well (which is rare for these shows); there are usually only a handful of the same tired old roles available to K-drama parents/elders (i.e. usually you're either: a rich manipulative ass, a drunken deadbeat dad, a poor sick mom, etc). Here, the parents are refreshingly portrayed as regular people going through their everyday lives as a normal middle aged/middle class couple. In many ways, the parents practically exemplify what the entire spirit of this show is all about.Summary: All in all, this is a quickly paced and very effective series that I have virtually no complaints about whatsoever. It features a simple and approachable story that should resonate with a wide range of viewers; young/old, Korean/not Korean, male/female, it doesn't really matter. Engaging, smart, funny, poignant; this is a perfect example of how good KTV dramas can be when they aspire to be more than just \"stylishly status quo\".Bottom Line: A real gem for K-drama fans that's not to be missed! 9 out of 10 stars!...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!", "Every once in a while, amidst the multitudes of Korean dramas which employ all the stereotypical clich\u00e9s such as Cinderella story lines, hapless women who have tear ducts the size of the Pacific Ocean, and men fighting over mates like gorillas, a show such as Reply 1997 comes along to provide viewers with a breath of fresh air. I recently undertook a marathon session of this drama after many recommendations from friends, and I don't know why I waited so long; everything about Reply 1997 is believable, relatable, and most of all entertaining. This drama will transport you to 1990's S. Korea, as several high school students wrestle with the ups and downs of life while dealing with one another. Reply 1997 will make you yearn for the good ol' days of your adolescence, as well as reminisce about the golden years of S. Korea. I guarantee that you go straight to your computer and make a playlist of most of the songs that are wonderfully woven into the drama.Many different and surprisingly complex themes are explored in every episode; many of the experiences portrayed are those that you or someone close to you have probably gone through, and this drama recognizes that real life happens. One quip I had with Reply 1997 is that some of these themes could have been developed a little more, such as that involving Joon Hee. Another issue I could see arising is that viewers who are not familiar with the pop culture of 1990's S. Korea could have difficulty catching onto some of the references made. This is minor, however, as the top-notch acting and stellar writing more than make up for this.Seriously, just go watch this thing. The only regret you'll have after you're done is that you won't be able to watch anymore episodes.", "I like series that are set in the past and tell us how life was back then while also giving us a glimpse of events from those specific years. Reply does exactly that! \nThe first installment in the series is called 'Reply 1997'. The story revolves around six protagonists - Shi Won, Yoon Jae, Yoo Jung, Joon Hee, Hak Chan and Sung Jae who are in their senior year of high school and are busy figuring out life after school. The main protagonist is Shi Won played by Jung Eun Ji from the popular K-Pop girl group APink. Shi Won has just one love in her life - H.O.T! She will go any lengths to be a core member of their fan club. She'll skip school to stand in line for their album. She'll run away from home just so she can have a glimpse of her idol. Shi Won has absolutely no clue about life after school because she is just too immersed in her love for her favourite boy band from S.M.Entertainment. She may not be the best of students but she can come up with steamy plotlines about her favorite idol's personal life!\nWhat makes this series popular is the fact that it introduces to all its audiences, both international and domestic, to the fact that 'Fan Fictions' have been in existence since the dawn of boy bands. One of the most loved themes of the series is the rivalry between White Angels and Yellow Kies. When Shi Won finds out that her best friend is no longer a White Angel but a fan of Sechs Kies all hell breaks loose. What makes all of this even more funny is the fact that Eun Ji Won who plays Hak Chan is actually a band member of Sechs Kies.\nSechs Kies and H.O.T were the first few bands to have such large members in their fandom. The fight scene between White angels and Yellow Kies is nothing but epic but the ultimate climax is when the victor is announced!\nThe series played a very important role in bringing to the fore the foundation of the Hallyu (Korean Wave) that has swept over the world in over two decades and is still going strong. Sung Dong Il and Lee Il Hwa who play Shi Won's parents are portrayed as a couple that's always bickering but there is a definite under current of love that we keep getting a glaring glimpse of throughout the series. Who would've thunk that they would be able to take and make their characters so popular amongst everybody who watched it!\nApart from the obvious KPop theme - other aspects of High School life are dealt with very delicately. This first installment has a mystery theme. The story begins in current day 2012 but takes us back to 1997. We learn how the characters met and their relationship with each other is established and we also see how their friendship has progressed from 1997 to 2012 but in the present day of the series Shi Won is pregnant and the audience is left guessing as to who her partner is at the end of each episode.", "The first of the Reply series is a classic for the K Drama fans, but surely it's a nice watch for everyone as well. The story focuses on a group of friends who meet again in a school reunion in 2012. While they are at the reunion, we see their lives back in school in the 1990's and also await for the mystery of who the female lead ends up marrying. The story is quite entertaining, with the characters being very funny and cute, and the main romance good enough, although it wasn't a big mystery for long. Probably the only problem with the series was that it had too many references on 1990's culture, but my subs explained fairly enough and I kind of was familiar with some of the bands that the girls were obsessed with. And it was nice to see the early K pop fangirling, where it all began. Fortunately, the back and forth wasn't tiring, as it happened only once or twice in each episode, and mostly in the beginning and ending. So 7 out of 10.", "I've watched all 3 versions of the reply series and this one is my favorite. I loved the characters and they did a great job! I also loved how we kept going back and forth from present to the past. I highly recommend especially if you enjoy nostalgia shows, this will probably take you back in time. I was pleased with the storyline very much although I also wished this one had a wedding sooner than letting the many years pass but I guess it's just how things worked out. At least the couple who I wanted to get together did!

As such the film has this kind of odd intent of wanting to show how competitive life was during the age of dinosaurs, but at the same time inject a kind of family friendly children's fair to the whole thing.So it is that we see Pangea as seen through the eyes of Speckles, the Tarbosaurus, a breed of Tyrannosaur, as he and his family struggle to survive the the very unforgiving environment of the late Cretaceous period, where supersized hyper-predators hunt and prey off of equally gigantic sauropods. We are spared the bloodshed, but not the hunt and the bite.And this is kind of the odd thing about this movie; all the violence is there, but not the explicit element that makes violence so abhorrent; shedding blood. Which, for a children's film, is a good thing, but one is hard pressed to gauge the violence as the actual attacks and bites are shown, as well as dinosaurs (friendly, non-friendly, and hapless prey) are shown dying, attacking, or being attacked.That's kind of the duel edged nature of a movie like this. The film makers put in the presence of a family, even a romance and the rebuilding of a family to give the film a kind of life that we mere humans can relate to, but the reality of the dinosaur era was that the \"monsters\" often so referred to by scientists, were, in reality, truly monsters. They were predators that knew only one thing; they needed to kill to eat. when you go to a museum and see the skeletons of creatures of epochs long since gone, we tend to marvel at them from a distance and then put them out of our minds. But if you really thought about those times, and what the behaviors of the creatures that lived back then would have been like, it should make your shiver a little. There was no more violent time to be alive than to be a dinosaur in the mix of a predator prey relationship.So the film is successful in presenting an honest look at dinosaur lives, and doesn't pull too many punches to deliver us a children's tale. The film is, on its own level, a resounding success. But I wonder if it was wise to make such a film in the first place, one where we see dinosaurs killing other dinosaurs. Then again I thin of all the Westerns I saw as a child, and all of the gunfights and all of the actors and stunt-men who played people getting shot in those movies and TV shows, and I think perhaps I'm worrying too much about this film.All in all it's a decent watch. I'm still out to lunch on deciding whether I'd let any of my children watch it. So I guess my best advice to any parent reading this review is to watch the movie yourself first, and then decide whether you think your young one can handle the action in the film.Then again, remember, hey are dinosaurs, creatures that lived a long time ago, and are thankfully gone (mostly anyway).Give it shot, and see what you think.Overall a decent movie.", "(Note, this review MAY contains Spoilers!)I remember watching this movie on YouTube two years ago. I was initially pessimistic about it, considering that this movie is Korean. As I watched more, I couldn't help but find myself liking this film. After all, I am a lover of dinosaurs and its quite badass having a Tarbosaurus as the protagonist.To start off, the story is basic: The life of a Tarbosaurus named Speckles. Initially having a happy life, his family and life is shattered when a Tyrannosaurus named One Eye appears usurps their territory, killing them in the process. What follows is the tribulations and struggle of Speckles who tries to survive during his lifetime. Overtime, we get to see his character mature as he grows up.So, what are my thoughts of this film? As stated before, I like this film. For kids, it is an enjoyable dino-flick and I think the film is suitable for families of all ages. However for dino-nerds and professional critics, its a hard watch as many usually point out the lack of logic and the excessive flaws of any film possible (Even the best ones).The Good: To start off, I like the character of Speckles. You can quickly empathise with him and his maturity and growth over the course of the story is very well done. Other characters include Blue Eyes (Another major character), Speckles's family and One Eye (The antagonist) who while somewhat generic, seem to serve their purpose quite well. One Eye is a character that you WILL hate, so that's a good plus for me. The animation is brilliant and that's what I think is the movie's best element, considering that Speckles was meant to be a 3D film. The story is simplistic, but I think it works and flows with the coming-of-age genre quite decently. Aside from the titular Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, there are also several dinosaurs not known to the public (E.g. Tsintaosaurus, Therizinosaurus, Pukyongosaurus and Charanosaurus) featured which I think helps the film in being colourful and more diverse in establishing different fauna. Lastly, the music of the film is superb in my opinion. It catches the mood quite effectively and provides a sense of adventure and thrill in this film.The Bad: Not every film is perfect.The same can be said for Speckles. Firstly, the film's story is shown through narration, which goes through different voice-overs depending on Speckles's age. Needless to say, it was insipid (Especially the narrator for infant Speckles) and I felt it was distracting and a juvenile attempt to make the film more geared towards kids. While there is a good species number of dinosaurs in this film, its easy to point out that several of them are actually FROM North America (Tyrannosaurus, Torosaurus and Ankylosaurus for example). Some animals are even over-exaggerated (One species reaching lengths of a 100 feet, despite being way smaller!). One Eye also seems to resemble Scar from The Lion King (Notice that BOTH have scars) and are cunning, but I'd say both are good villains in their own right.In conclusion, Speckles the Tarbosaurus results in it's pros slightly overpowering its cons to make itself known as a film kids could enjoy. There are heart-warming scenes which while depressing, also makes the story a little bit more forced when it comes to empathising with Speckles, but they are sad nonetheless. For dino-nerds, its a mixed bag and its a tough call when it comes to watching something realistic about dinosaurs. However, Speckles the Tarbosaurus makes for a good substitute and I'd say its an enjoyable film. For anyone who was kids who love dinosaurs, I'd say give them a watch. You'll let me know :).For my evaluation in terms of story, characters, music, animation and my own personal enjoyment, I would give Speckles a 7.8 out of ten. My best recommendation is that you should rather watch the movie on YouTube rather than just buying it. Kids will love this film and adults will find it heart-warming and depressing Overall, its a good dinosaur film albeit with its own set of flaws and a nice departure from NOT using well known dinosaurs (E.g. Apatosaurus) as the protagonist, having shifted to a lesser known species (Tarbosaurus) for a boosting popularity.", "The first time I saw a trailer of this on Youtube, I thought it was something related with that \"Walking with Dinosaurs\" movie from the year 2013. Anyway, this wasn't anything particularly memorable, having many predictable clich\u00e9s from other movies about Dinosaurs: I guess the Disneyfied plot and anthropomorphic behavior exhibited by the dinosaurs in this film would have been more tolerable if it wasn't for the incredibly annoying voice-over narration, which constantly explains the viewers what is already happening on screen. Besides of being obvious and redundant, it makes all the most dramatic and intense moments of the plot to lose its effect, feeling more like a forced attempt to make the story more kid-friendly. And that is a shame, because there were a couple of genuinely interesting scenes which had the potential to made this movie something much more interesting than it actually turned out to be.", "I haven't written any reviews, so this is my first.I have no idea how to feel about this movie. Its presented in a childlike way, as if its pretending to be a kiddy movie. But I think this might be the most depressing and sad movie I've ever seen...No it doesn't have blood, but it has child murder, genocide, starvation, drowning in tar, babies getting squished by rocks, whole family death, whole family death again, throwing babies off a cliff, pack hunting, killing of helpless dinos, stampedes of dinosaurs falling off cliffs, volcano erupting and balls of fire smashing running dinos, more stampedes of dinos running off cliffs, and abandoning your family to be feasted upon by rapters.This is not a kids movie.", "The animation in this movie is outstanding. Sadly, that is the end of what's good about it. It's told from the point of view of Speckles, the youngest dinosaur in the pack and that is the main problem. They put a tremendous amount of work into creating a incredible graphics, a photo realistic world to depict the violent life of the dinosaurs and then used a anthropomorphized child's voice with horrible dialog that sounds like its from a PBS kids show as the main narration. Imagine watching Jurassic Park with Fifel the Mouse narrating the movie for the first third of the film and you get the picture. Eventually, the voice get older as Speckles get older but the dialog gets no better and the story becomes ridiculous (including showing a Tarbosaurus (similar to a Tyrannosaurus) cliff dive into the ocean). While it's not a documentary, it would have been better served with adult documentary like narration. That change alone would have made this movie more watchable. No narration would have been better and made this movie much more watchable.", "I stumbled across this movie on YouTube. I decided to watch it because there was nothing better to do. 128 minuets later, this is what i have to say about it: Not bad.The movie does, of course, have flaws. I counted about four obvious factual mistakes. But what this movie does well is the animation and story. To some, there's no story. But it tells the life of a Tarbosaurus named Speckles (Weird name choice). There are no events that are useless. They're all important to the story. What people seem to have the biggest issue with is the voice-over. It doesn't need to be there. The movie could have gone without Speckles talking. I didn't find it too annoying at the adult stage. But dear god, the baby stage!The first parts with the baby can be annoying. But if you get past that (and it's not that long), you'll find yourself enjoying the movie. The movie can be very serious. I feel that it takes inspiration from the movie Dinosaur (2000), and it shows. If you can stomach the kid, then it will be worth watching.", "Tarbosaurus was one of those movies where the technology was excellent but the movie wasn't. Right now, IMDb is running 3.8 points on this, and as I am a lover of dinosaurs I was merciful and gave it that much.The movie comes from South Korea and their animation was really good. Their sound effects were generally good too. Unfortunately they ruined it all with an overly anthropomorphic set of cutesy characters. Oh, the fun dinosaur family. Single Mom, oldest son, younger two daughters and then the little boy. Oh how cute.The dinosaurs were also far too intelligent. Note the boulder being used as a weapon against the ankylosaur. Tool using dinosaurs, come on! The motivations were not logical for predators. They took unnecessary chances and they wasted opportunities.For a movie out within the last few years, they also messed up a lot on Dinosaur facts. They put the movie at 80 million years ago and have velociraptors. The velociraptor found were from 75 to 71 million years ago. The velociraptors also had big feathers on their arms. They showed them with a \"mohawk punk rocker\" bit of feathers but that's all. Worse yet, they showed protoceratops and pukyongosaurus. They were from the EARLY cretaceous, tens of millions of years earlier. They said the torosaurus (like a triceratops) broke off its horns and showed them as hollow. The \"horns\" of ceratopsians were solid bone, not hollow horn.I could go on and on, but you get the picture. They were so close but they blew it.", "Many people will be wondering why I gave this movie a 6/10, many critics are giving this harsh reviews, which this movie doesn't deserve, so I'm here to share to you why I thought this movie was both entertaining, action packed and upsetting at the same time.This move takes place in 80 million year old South Korea, this is were we meet our protagonist Speckles, This is my first complaint why is our hero named Speckles, this shows laziness or even stupidity in the character design and this name is not very intimidating as it is a ferocious meat eating Tarbosaurus, which is a relative of the Tyrannosaurus Rex, this brought it down a point. Why couldn't they name the dinosaur differently, here are some names you can give him, Lunar scar, moon-fire, Half-moon, are just to name a few.Another complaint I have in this movie, is in both the Narrators, they are boring and uninteresting and the child narrator gets annoying at times, the main narrators voice when the protagonist is an sub adult and so forth is not intimidating, why couldn't they get a deeper narrator voice for the adult part, why not James Earl Jones, that would have been more appropriate for at least the adult segment, so this again brings it down a pointThe final two complaints I have of this movie is that they kill off Blue eyes (Speckles mate) and Incorrect data of the dinosaurs, the second one brings down more points than the first but here is why I did not like them killing Blue eyes, she was a main character, she was Speckles friend for over 20 or so years and his mate and finally she gets her corpse abandoned by Speckles so as to be disgraced by Raptors was the final indignity to this character, half a point off.The second issue takes away the final 1.5 points away, most of the dinosaurs and creatures were not in their proper time lines, for example Velociraptors appear ed 75 million years ago, Tyrannosaurus Rex and Tarbosaurus around 70 million years ago and so forth. another issue is that the dinosaurs were also not in their proper geographical setting, most of the dinosaurs were from North America, Torosaurus, Tyrannosaurus and so forth, even the Asian dinosaurs weren't found in South Korea, Tarbosaurus lived in Northern Mongolia when it lived on planet Earth.I can live with this even though I am a Dino Freak and know more information than most, my reasoning the Disney Movie Dinosaur. This Movie had certain in-corrections, most Hadrosaurs, Raptors, Ceratopsians and Ornithomimosaurs all lived in the Northern Hemisphere, Iguanodontids and Abelisaurs like Carnotaurus lived in the southern Hemisphere and most of the animals in that film lived in different times as well as this films. So why is this film getting hammered for this and not Dinosaur Another thing about the dinosaurs is the looks, especially on the Raptors, is incorrect and foolish, the Raptors look like punk rejects from the 90's what the hell is with that, but how did the other elements of this movie hold up lets find out The Movie had great CGI, and sound effects, the Visuals were astounding and even the eruption scene was done spectacularly and there is two points already, the story was mediocre but great for a movie like this and it has some great character development, especially later in the film, this brought the movie up to 4 points. I have read crap about this movie before hand it is not accurate to what it is portraying, that is true to some point, but yet again these reviewers overlooked a fine detail, that this is a \"Movie\" and not a documentary, Dinosaur did the same thing and reviewers aren't slamming that down its throat like in this \"Movie\".The thing that brings this movie up to six is the Characters and the Antagonist One Eye, the characters in this film are fleshed out pretty well and add on to the fight scene between One Eye and Speckles, for example when Speckles family dies due to One Eye starting a stampede to rid himself of his rival and even killing his own mother while he watch gives a sense of remorse to this young Tarbosaurus and builds the suspension to the fight later, even though he fights and even beats One Eye earlier in the film. But know lets go to one eye, and ow my God he is bad ass and ruthless, shown by his killing of Speckles family, he shows his bad ass style a few times in this film the first for me is when he climbs out of the sink hole, the second when he tries to rape Blue eyes or mate whichever you prefer so he can take her away from speckles and finally the underwater fight scene.This is also where I have read crap lately, that the hunting used by One Eye, the boulder to trap an Ankylosaur tail, was to intelligent for this dinosaur, and I would agree if this was a documentary, this is a film and films are not always meant to make sense, even to a well known fact, Dinosaur did it to Alidar the main protagonist and the leaders of the herd of Herbivore dinosaurs which were known to be less intelligent to Therapod or carnivorous dinosaurs period, with a few exceptions.Time to finish off here, this is only opinion based and you can either love this movie of hate it, it is great for the whole family and it gives you some facts about the dinosaurs it is portraying, but for the sake of this movie a remake needs to be made and in this remake make sure Blue Eyes doesn't die, but to Dino fans, new comers to the Dinosaur genre and to people with an open mind I recommend this film", "People are ridiculous complaining about random dinosaur inaccuracies. This is a movie for children - a little brutal - but somehow my boys don't care and love it. They've watched this as many times as I used to watch Dumbo. (Wait, you mean elephants can't fly?) If you want a documentary on tarbosaurus or tyrannosaurus or velociraptor, then this isn't for you. I wouldn't watch an action film and then complain about how the drama was unrealistic. My recommendation: don't overthink this people.", "As a dinosaur enthusiast, I can comfortably call this movie the Citizen Kane of dinosaur movies. With dynamic characters and a riveting story that seamlessly tied in adult themes (love, death, and revenge) to a children's movie, I can safely call this movie a future classic. Every frame and line of dialogue is pure 24k GOLD. The one-line zingers keeps the audience on the edge of their seat for the entire movie. One of the best movies OF ALL TIME. The movie can be thoroughly enjoyed by a viewing by yourself or with a group of friends. 11/10 would recommend, can't wait for the sequel coming this summer! I will certainly have a showing of this in my college's dinosaur club.", "My son few times.....that most wanted to watch for an experience ..."], "805": ["Oh My Ghost (aka Oh My Ghostess) is a 16 episode 2015 KTV drama. The story involves a lowly kitchen worker who wants to become a chef, the head chef as the romantic interest, and a ghost who wants to settle her grudge. There's also a murder mystery angle involved.SPOILERS AHEAD!Our story revolves around 2 young women; one is a lonely restaurant assistant who has a crush on her boss, but is too shy to act on it. She also happens to have the ability to see ghosts, which ain't helping her any in her personal or professional life. The other woman is a ghost who can't find her way to the afterlife because she's resentful that she died a virgin. She can't remember how she died and doesn't really care at first., she's just looking to inhabit any living woman she can in order to lose her virginity so she can finally leave this world. Ghost girl meets living girl and discovers that the chef she has a crush on is one of the few living men who can handle her \"supernatural sexual powers\". Thus, ghost girl plans to quickly enter living girl's body to have sex with this chef in order to satisfy her desires before departing earth forever.What happens here is ghost girl periodically inhabits living girl in order to accomplish her main goal (i.e. getting laid). This creates all kinds of problems for the living girl, as she can't remember anything that occurs when the ghost girl takes over her body. Furthermore, these two women are polar opposites in terms of their personalities; living girl is timid and lethargic, and ghost girl is an aggressive loud mouth. Thus, everyone around living girl now thinks she's suffering from some multiple personality disorder as she switches back & forth from quiet & reserved to boisterous & outgoing (depending on whether her body is being occupied by the ghost girl or not).Unfortunately for ghost girl, this chef she's trying to seduce has old fashioned values and wants to take the slow approach to a relationship. She just wants to hop in the sack with the guy, but he won't acquiesce, and this frustrates her to no end. Left with few options, ghost girl and living girl team up in order to find a solution for each of their separate problems; ghost girl helps living girl blossom as an all-around woman and win over the man she likes, and living girl allows ghost girl to continually try to accomplish her goal while also helping her out in other ways. It doesn't take long before these two girls become BFF's while also balancing out each other's personalities.Everything is going according to plan, but problems eventually arise. Ghost girl starts falling in love with the chef over time (which was not her intention), and living girl discovers that ghost girl's grudge may not be related to being a virgin at all. There's also an attractive career woman vying for the chef's affection that must be dealt with, and someone who might be inhabited by an evil spirit that eventually represents your main antagonist on several fronts. From there, it's just a matter of following along with the story to see how everything will play out.As usual, you need to give these K-dramas some breathing room to see how they evolve before casting judgement. The first few episodes are a little rocky but the story does settle in quickly, and it's mostly entertaining for the bulk of its run time.There's a lot to like about this story and this show, and it's helped greatly by the performance of the two lead actresses. I'm quite familiar with Park Bo-young (who portrays the living girl, and is the main star of the show), and she just kills it in a role that requires her to start out acting on opposite ends of the spectrum and slowly blending them into some middle ground over time. Kim Seul-gi plays the ghost girl, and this isn't the first time I've seen her play a bit of a manic character in a supporting role, but she's quite good at it, and somebody needs to give her shot at as a lead actress asap. These two actresses drive this show from start to finish, and they interact so well that you'd think they've been working together for years.Jo Jung-suk plays the chef and lead love interest. He's fairly likable and effective (especially when compared to the asshole head chef character portrayed in 'Pasta') and, of course, he's pretty easy on the eyes. The rest of the cast of characters not mentioned above consist of the \"ghost catcher\" lady with a soft spot for the ghost girl, an assortment of fit subordinate chef dudes ranging from reasonable to obnoxious and that get shirtless for no reason (other than to obviously appease the female viewers), along with a few others of import.This show utilizes several cooking related segments throughout, and a few ghostly special effects as needed, and while both of these of aspects are employed rather sparsely, they do serve their purpose. Production values are solid enough for this type of show, and it's competently written and directed as well (though you'll have to excuse the lack of rules of what a ghost can or can't do). There is a bit of lag during some of the middle episodes, but not so much that it doesn't comply with my number one rule for any K-drama (i.e. \"Don't Be Boring!\").Summary: Is it great?...Of course not!. But there are a number of things to like here. It does ultimately work quite well for what it is, it's also pretty well paced, and there's a nice mix of drama, humor, poignancy, suspense, love, etc. Personally, I thought it was very nicely done!Bottom Line: 8 out of 10 stars on the K-Drama scale!...Solidly Recommended!", "I've seen many, many dramas; many good, some bad, others just forgettable. There are those I consider great, as in classics. Dramas I've seen twice or more, and will probably watch yet again in the future. Which is saying something because these things are often like watching 16+ hour films. Secret Garden, My Girlfriend is a Gumiho, Lovely Kim Sam Soon, Hello Agashi, Cunning Single Lady, Healer, My Love From Another Star...well there are a bunch, and this is no exception.It's a bittersweet love story about moving on, letting go and overcoming obstacles. This drama nails the balance between humor, drama, thriller and the macabre. The acting, direction and writing are all top notch. The two actresses who star in the drama are stand outs - especially the main gal as she plays two completely different personalities flawlessly. If you are a fan of Korean dramas, or are new to the genre, this one is a fantastic watch. Highly recommend this one!!!", "Oh My Ghost! has a great premise of a young, shy, timid girl (Bong-Sun) who can see and even communicate with ghosts. Petrified and \"harassed,\" she finds herself constantly tired due to lack of sleep and doing her best to avoid these pesky spirits! She even goes so far as to cover the walls of her tiny apartment in talismans and anything else that might keep the spirits away.Enter Soon-Ae, a ghost who spends much of her time eluding the local shaman (Seobingo), who can not only see and interact with spirits, but she can catch them too!Bong-Sun works at a restaurant under a nationally recognized chef who is constantly scolding her for her lack of attention, lack of energy, and most importantly, her lack of confidence. Constantly apologizing, she drives Chef Kang crazy, as well as her co-workers. Once again, after being chased by Seobingo, Soon-Ae takes possession of Bong-Sun, and this is where the fun begins! Through the sudden habitation of Soon-Ae, Bong-Sun's personality is altered. She's confident, not shy at all, and even demonstrates innate cooking abilities, much to the shock and surprise of Chef Kang and his fellow cooks. Of course, the series is about how Bong-Sun and Chef Kang will come together, as he's completely caught off-guard by her sudden forwardness and flirtations. The series is a complete delight! I can't say enough about Bo-Young Park's performance. She's able to switch personalities of Bong-Su and being possessed by Soon-Ae with all of the deftness of a master at her craft. The beauty of this is that Park is equally charming in both \"roles.\" She is so cute and adorable, that you love her in either part. Her charm is what drives the series. Of course, there is also a mystery to be solved regarding Soon-Ae and how and why she died. Her story is just as interesting and intriguing as Bong-Sun's. In fact, it can be noted that her story is touching as well as tragic. So much so, that you may find it hard to choke back a few tears. Seul-Gi Kim does a magnificent job in this role. The series is a perfect balance and blend of drama, comedy, suspense, and romance. The four cooks who work under Kang are a perfect fit when a laugh is needed. They are hilarious and they work off each other so wonderfully. The entire cast is to be commended. There really isn't anything contrived at all in this series. The plot flows smoothly without anything feeling forced. I've seen too many plots where the writers and the director loses sight of the story and feels that they have to come up with something that is scarcely believable or plausible. Oh My Ghost! is a terrific series that you may have a hard time stopping after watching just one episode. You'll find yourself laughing a lot, shedding a few tears, and cheering in the end for Bong-Sun and Soon-Ae. Both of them realize that the key to Life is to Love. Because without it, Life is pretty dismal, whether you're alive or a ghost!", "This is one of the best korean drama i've ever watched! I really love Park Bo Young Characters! We can tell the difference when she plays the role of Na bong sun and the ghost. And for the Chef, he's so full of charisma! I'm starting to like him a lot <3 A lot of viewers are more liking the love between the ghost and chef. But i'm not. I really ship na bong sun and chef! Na bong sun really likes him a lot. She even made a scrap book about chef. And from my point of view, chef also likes her from the first time he saw her. At first, he acted like a bad guy because he thought that na bong sun shouldn't be a shy and always say 'sorry' to everything that she'd done. He didn't want her to be like him in the past who always got bullied by his school 'friends'. So he's hoping that she will do her best for herself. and this drama is really worth to watch. You won't be disappointed. OH MY GHOST, FIGHTING!", "I had never watched a Korean Drama before, I was scrolling on Netflix looking for something to watch for an hour to unwind and thought the premise sounded interesting. Then, I proceeded to watch as many episodes as possible until I fell unconscious. I did this for the next three days, everyday I got home from work. I was absolutely shattered but didn't care. Then, when I finished the series, I decided to go and watch my favourite parts over and over and over again. This is definitely in my top 10 favourite TV shows of all time. All the actors are amazing, Park Bo-Young is absolutely terrific at acting as two different characters. The cinematography was done perfectly, I cannot describe to you the emotion and the humour that some of these shots added. The plot, the mystery, the suspense! And, of course, the romance! It was unpredictable, original and made me blush, laugh and cry. I've been in such a cheery mood since watching it. All the different characters and their storylines, this show had so many layers. I don't want to hype it up too much, but I do absolutely love it and would recommend it if you want something that can be both fun and emotional.", "At first I thought this drama was okay for the first few episodes. As things got very intense I started to like it. Bo-Young Park really played an amazing job showing two different personalities in a professional and seamless change of a person being possessed. Her acting was definitely on point. The entire series really provided everything I like to see in a drama; Romance, Comedy, Supernatural (which was not too scary) and Crime. The story of everything really matched up and made me want to watch til everything was solved and investigations were lingering. Good series to watch and would recommend to see all the actors hard work and dedication for the outcome of this series.", "The story is about a cute girl named Na Bong-Sun (Park Bo-Young) who works at a restaurant, owned by famous star chef named Kang Sun-Woo (Cho Jung-Seok). Bong-Sun is quiet timid girl with an ability to see and communicate with ghost. The opposite of her, is Kang Sun-Woo, the good looking and confident guyOne day, Bong-Sun was possessed by the ghost, named Shin Soon-Ae who was trying to seduce Sun-Woo using Bong-Sun, believes by doing so, she can ascend to heaven before turning into evil spirit. Bong-Sung who was possessed, suddenly transformed into a girl with bright and confident trait, amuse those around her.The story then revolves around the mystery case of the death of Shin Soon-Ae almost 3 years ago and the love story between Bong-Sun and Sun-Woo. I like how the story tries to depict Bong-Sun growth and improvement of herself to be more confident. At first all the transformation is caused by Soon-Ae, but along the way, Bong-Sun meet a lot of different people and experience new thing that help her character to grow. This movies contain so much element, it is funny, romantic but not too cheesy, interesting character with plot and story intertwined with each other bring an unexpected element of surprise,moral of the story which is relatable with our life, superb acting from all the cast, nice character development, great OST music, etc.In short, this is one of my favourite Korean Drama, 16 episode, and you will find yourself entertained by it, give it a try!", "Thank You NETFLIX, I am more humble to see another awesome 16 episodes mini drama from Korea. First, it was IRIS, Black, LIVE and just finished with \"Oh My Ghost\". \nGreat story and casting, if you don't like the first 3 episodes. Then you are missing a wonderful story, it'll make you laugh, sad, cry and mystery. Don't watch it if you cry easily like me.\nEpisode 16 got me with 8 tissues that I had to dry my tears away.

Very shocking, touching and enjoyable tv show.", "It's been 4 years since this drama has been released and it's so good. I am rewatching this drama again because of the swirl of emotions I get from watching it the first time. The two main characters has an amazing chemistry on screen. Even made me search for them in real life to see if they happen to be dating each other! Definitely a must watch and it would be nice if they came out with Oh My Ghost 2, with the same cast. I will await for sequels! Wishful thinking...", "This was a great viewing experience. The 16 episodes have everything you could ask for in a series. There was comedy, drama, mystery and suspense in just about every episode. The characters had depth and charisma. The actors were excellent. The view of Korean society was intriguing and educational. Well worth your time. Enjoy.", "It was spell bounding and beautiful. In in love with the Korean tv industry, they just seem to already know what people want to watch and portray it so effectively and wonderfully. If you love romance and feel good tv, this is a must watch!", "It's really refreshing to experience this series as a romance, tv-soap, spiritual ghost story and a crime thriller. They fit together so well it doesn't feel like anything in the story was made up like weird coincidences or odd conversations to skip any possible plot holes.", "I wasn't sure whether I should watch this drama or not. From the plot summery, it seemed like yet another bubbly K drama, with the cute girl getting into all shorts of trouble, but finally getting the boy. In this case the girl, the loner and with no self esteem sous chef Na Bong, has feelings for her chef, arrogant Sun Woo. But she only gets a chance with him after she is being possessed by a ghost. That's the main plot. Then there is the story of the ghost's past, her death (neither of which she can remember), and the complicated love triangle. There were some funny moments, though the romance wasn't that great, as you didn't know whether to like Na Bong or the ghost, but the whole mystery, bad guy chase really gave something to this drama. Of course it all resolves to Park Bo Young's acting. She can swift from one character to the other with great easiness that you can distinguish the ghost from the real person quickly. The whole cooking theme was a great idea as well, as it gave a nice atmosphere to the drama. So 6 out of 10."], "806": ["This is one of the most tear-jerking, and brilliantly written pieces of writing I've ever seen. Not only does the story provide historical information on how poorly the Koreans were treated back in the 1900s, but they somehow successfully managed to make a purely tragic tale into an exciting one that people can really enjoy. Easily one of the greatest shows I've ever seen, not only out of Korean dramas, but in the world. During the entire drama, I was never left scratching my head, questioning what happened to the ___, or why does ___ happen, that made no sense. Each little detail was weaved into the bigger scheme of the plot and all in all by the end, the story was perfect. 10/10 Masterpiece, easily."], "807": [], "808": ["Few years ago Korean society was shocked by a horrible serial killer mayhem.

He mashed victim's liver with food processors and drank it. Now the serial killer is sentenced to death and his existence throw serious questions about execution of death sentenced prisoner to the Korean society. For ten years Korean government never executed prisoners and now UN approved Korea as a No Execution country.This movie is a product of these social circumstance. Of course any modernized country can have notorious serial killers. But this is most brutal and abominable criminal act as reported to the public.Another phenomena described in this movie are the inactive police act and ugly politician. Koreans are very disappointed at this and this movie is quite accurately visualized the situation.Whether or not crime is the best motif for movie and this movie successfully hold the breath of viewers. I am waiting another movie from this director.Good work.", "What a movie. When I rented this movie I didn't know what to expect. It is usually is a hit or miss for Korean movies but this was a grand slam out of the park type of movie. The film is about a former detective turn pimp trying to catch a serial killer who is killing his prostitutes. It's a big cat and mouse game between the two throughout the whole movie. The plot sounds thin but there is so much more than what meets the eye. This is one of the best thriller/serial killer movies I have ever seen and I don't want to say too much about the plot because it is very edge of your seat kind of stuff. The film never drags and it becomes more intriguing the more you watch and you feel like you know the character because the actors portray them so well. This is a very violent and gruesome film that shouldn't be viewed by the squeamish even though there isn't that many bloody scenes for being a serial killer movie. The movie achieves so much more with less, which hardly ever works in films that need violence to be a success. I wish that Hollywood or even European films would have the brass to make a film this unique and daring at the same time. The thing that this film has going for it the most is that it's wonderfully erratic. You can never guess what is going to happen next and that is the reason why Korean movies are so fantastically entertaining. I rank this movie in my top three greatest thriller/serial killer movies of all time somewhere between \"Seven\" and \"Silence of the Lambs\". The characters of this film really flesh out the story and let you jump right in. I can't help but stress the point that this film is very unpredictable and the style of the story telling is subtle but very effective. This film is a sure bet and you will not leave disappointed.", "If the remake of Infernal Affairs (The Departed) won all those Oscars then a re-make of this movie will surely clean up. Its one of those movies that just doesn't let up. At any given time there are at least three threads to the story, each of which keeps you on the edge of your seat. I actually had to stop it at one point so I could calm down a bit.The acting by everyone involved is very believable and that makes it quite harrowing at points. I don't want to give away a single thing about the story but what I can say is that its an absolutely brilliant twist on a story that has been done many times before.If you are going to see just one foreign film this year then let it be this one.", "Korean cinema does it again. \"The Chaser\" is another great movie from the Korean film stable. The plot stems around an amoral ex-cop turned pimp who after losing some of his \"working girls\" decides to track down and find the client behind this. He ends up finding himself involved in more than he bargained for, with the client being a serial killer, and its then a chase to find his last girl sent to him whilst the police also try to pin him down but are hampered by legal red tape and politics.As you'd expect from a Korean film from the cop thriller genre it can be very violent, and there's no denying that for this film, however thankfully it doesn't overshadow the rest of the movie. The chase is on, and the roller coaster of emotions following the pimp and the cops trying to stop the serial killer is nothing less than gripping, watching them go from one success to despair in short spaces of time. The tension is high and will tug on you right to the end.Importantly there is a lot of humour. The main character (Joong-ho Eom) is incredibly dry-witted, and is a release valve for the tension in the film. As he carries the film, the acting is important, and both he and the serial killer are exceptionally good. Can't argue with either or even the general ensemble.There is possibly an American re-make in the offing. Fair enough I guess as that's become the norm now, but I hope it doesn't dilute the central story or the action. This film is a great gem, and follows on from some of the other greats in the genre such as \"Memories of a Murder\" which is a classic. It will unsettle but for an intelligent thriller, it really is up there with the best in the past few years.", "After the two very positive comments I decided to watch this movies. At this point the movie has 59 votes. So I didn't expect much from the movie. I was asking myself the question: \"How can a movie from South Korea with only 59 votes deserve a 8,9? \" But after watching the movie I can say this is one of the very best movies EVER made. I have been watching movies for quite some time now. And I have seen almost all movies from the IMDb top 250. But this movie deserves to be in the top 20. No question about it, no exaggeration. Just look at my vote statistics and you will see that only gave a few movies a ten.So what's the story of the movie? A former detective who is now a pimp, thinks 2 of his girls ran away from him. So he tries to find those girls. After some research he learns the truth is a little bit different. From that point on, the movie never loses your grip. Never get's dull. Always keeps you right on the edge of your chair. For the rest, you really gotta see it. I won't spoil any of your viewing pleasure by telling you too much about the story.The other comment said something about a horror element, and a bit gore. But in my opinion there is no horror. Sure there is some blood, but it doesn't play a big part.So, why are you still reading my comment. Go and see where you can watch this movie!!", "The Chaser revolves around an ex-detective turned pimp who's under serious stress when he finds out his girls are being sold by a mysterious client. He goes on the chase to find this guy and put an end to his missing girls...and missing money. What begins to unfold is something him, the police or anyone for that matter, were unprepared to take on. Time and time again the film-makers from South Korea succeed and The Chaser is no different. With believable writing, fantastic acting (especially the lead who reminded me of Min Sik Choi) and an air of originality, Chaser easily became one of my favorite flicks of 2008. With side-stories aplenty, an evil villain and some brutal violence this is something any fan of darker film should enjoy.If you enjoy serious drama, investigation films, serial killers, great acting, you'll definitely enjoy this picture. I just wished they had a different title for the film. I like my title better. :)", "I wasn't sure about this film and the first ten minutes or so where not very promising, but I persevered as it was shown on BBC Four which has to mean something. Boy was I glad I hung in there. This film gets better and better and in spite of the violence, which was never gratuitous it is one of those films that will stay with me for a very long time. I have never seen a Korean film before but on this evidence it won't be the last. It's a refreshing change to see the back streets of Seoul instead of downtown Los Angeles. The cast is good and the star (a likable ex-rogue cop) turns an excellent performance. If you've got a strong stomach and get the chance, watch it but put the kids to bed first!", "That's another user or commentator, here on IMDb. And his last sentence is \"Go and watch the movie\". I fully stand behind this, because this was one of the best movies I've watched this year (at the Fright Fest in London).There's only a little thing that you should bare in mind: If you actually don't like Korean (or Asian movies for that matter), than this won't be for you. Especially if you like your movies to be according to a somewhat linear structure. While with other movies of this nature, you might foresee things happening, I was baffled (in a good way) with the directions this movie took. Very brave choices and a great script. The actors of course are phenomenal too. It all fits together in one whole perfect piece. If you like your thrillers to be ... well thrilling, than this is the one to watch!", "This is most probably the best Asian movies that i have ever seen. I did not expect much when i went to watch the movie but boy was i wrong. I was fully satisfied with this film because it had everything. The movie had suspense, action and abit of humour put into it The hero in this movie did not look like the hero that everyone is used to, he is rude,total disregard of other people's feeling and most of all he is selfish and only thinks about money and himself.But as we go along through this movie, we discover that he does have a conscience and goes out one of the girls he sent to the maniacal and psychotic killer in the movie.The cast in the movie gave a solid and believable performance especially ha jung woo as the villain in this movie.He showed no remorse or feel any guilt in killing those people.Overall this movie is great and if you like to watch any Asian movie, than this should be the one for you", "Wow! I caught wind of this through a magazine review and checked it out and was very glad I did. Some of the great stuff coming out of South Korea will blow your mind and this is no exception. The references people made to this movie being in the caliber of Oldboy and Memories of Murder are well substantiated but I would liken it more to Memories of Murder and not quite in the same league as Oldboy. The only movie in league with Oldboy is Seven. While the plot kind of reminded me of some of the classic 80s and 90s psycho-killer thrillers we have had come out of the US, it does hold up well on its own for being a foreign film. Not the most original plot but a decent twist on it nonetheless. Nothing in the plot or sequence of events stood out as unbelievable and there are some real gripping scenes that'll make you white-knuckle. There are some good character developments and reversals that I enjoyed as we see our main character, a former cop turned pimp, trying to find the guy who's been killing his girls and coming to grips with his personal responsibilities and justice. I don't want to give away the plot other than that as it would detract from your enjoyment. It does burn a little slow after the first 20 minutes of the movie as we see events unfold so be prepared for the reward in the last 30 minutes of the movie as the sequence of events crescendo. I'll be keeping an eye on this great director.", "First of all, let me start by saying that this movie clearly is one of the best movies that I have ever seen, providing a totally different approach to a horror/ Thriller / Crime genre. What's amazing about this movie is that it lets you know who is the killer right from the start. It shows what its cards are, but it still controls the game completely from the beginning to end, without ever giving out any dully moment.Having loved some of the recent Korean movies such as 'Memories of Murder' 'Old Boy' 'The Host' etc, I had a high expectation of this movie after a strong recommendation from my Korean friend, who advised me not to take my pregnant wife to the movie due to gory violence.It is indeed gory, but at least the scenes stop before the actual execution of bloody things, such as hammering a huge nail into a victim's head, etc. I guess it's less violent that the Saw series.Fantastic direction (from a rookie director), fantastic acting & a fantastic thriller. What a winner.", "This film is so Korean. The way it is shot and the way the story is told doesn't conform to the way many Americans think genre clues should be presented and adhered to. At it's heart, The Chaser is a crime drama about a serial killer and the guy who's chasing him, but it evolves from many different angles. It's a comedy of errors in the way the police and politicians are portrayed; a melodrama with its inclusion of the precocious little girl who belongs to the woman serving as the film's primary \"chase\" and investigative point; a psychological thriller in the way the serial killer messes with the minds of the police; a mildly gory film in the way the bad guy uses a hammer and chisel; a bit of a tragedy in the way it ends. The only thing missing from this film is romance. Thank god they didn't make one of the missing girls a love interest of the pimp\u0097he's only after the money they owe him. That's where the brilliance of the chase begins.There's a fight scene early on where our protagonist, an ex-detective gone bad turned pimp, is beating the crap out of some guy he thinks has kidnapped and sold some of his girls. A long uphill foot chase precedes the brawl so both combatants are extremely winded when the fighting begins\u0097punches don't land and there's a girly incompetence to the whole thing, which is to say, it's realistic. After finally landing a few punches that subdue his opponent momentarily, the pimp gets up and starts kicking him in disgust. He's very angry, still a bit winded and out of control. One of his kicks only grazes its target causing him to lose his balance and fall on his butt, and because of momentum he begins to roll and his feet fly up in the air. It seems funny, but it's not. You have to sneak in your chuckle as he gets up and continues kicking the guy. When he's finally pummeled his adversary into unconsciousness, he uses his foot to roll him onto his side so he can get to the wallet in his back pocket and ID him. He attempts to sit on him, not to keep him down, but because he's bone tired from all the fighting. He doesn't land squarely and ends up rolling on his butt again. It seems funny but it's not.After the fight scene both men are brought to the police station for questioning. Because the pimp is an ex-detective with a reputation, the cops initially sympathize with the other guy, thinking the pimp over-reacted\u0097not to mention the causal fender-bender that brought the two men together in the first place. The pimp doesn't know that the other guy just took a hammer and chisel to the head of the girl he is trying to get back, he thinks she's just freshly been sold, making his sense of urgency misplaced, where it remains throughout most of the film. It's kind of awkward for the police to find much urgency in one pimp accusing another of stealing one of his girls. The bad guy insists he didn't sell the girl and then mumbles under his breathe \"I killed her\", and confesses in great detail how he killed her and several other girls. The pimp screams at the cops, \"Can't you see he's just pretending to be crazy now?\"And so it goes. We know there's been killing going on and we know who's been doing it from very early on in the film but it manages to remain suspenseful throughout. The Chaser is a gripping thriller from the beginning until a few minutes from the end. The two main characters are portrayed with impeccable nuance. It's Yun-seok Kim's performance as the bewildered pimp that takes this film to great heights. There are so many things that don't go the way he wants them to, like people hanging up on him when he's talking to them on the phone, a little girl who startles him and asks too many smart questions, the cops can't do anything right; and every time, his subdued response of confused disbelief made me laugh. He brings a Kang-ho Song-ish melancholy humor to the film, (I can't think of an American actor to compare him to), while Jung-woo Ha as the impotent serial killer is so normal and unmoved it's creepy.There are a handful of groan out loud plot moves in The Chaser, but so what. There are also more than a handful of plot moves this film doesn't do, moves that most people will be guessing it will do, that it more than makes up for it. This is a film I know I'll watch again just for the performance of it. The plot won't matter. It's that good.More reviews at sitenoise-atthemovies.blogspot.com", "Hi everyone. So at first this movie seemed great. Solid acting, good opening, nice pacing, and then after about 30 minutes in the movie makes a turn for the worst.The entire last hour and a half of the movie are ridiculous, completely unbelievable garbage. The main killer is caught, and get this...for no reason at all...they free him almost immediately. It literally makes no sense at all. In the movie they act as if there is no proof of his deeds, although there is heaps of proof. They collected DNA evidence, they found that he beat a kid with a hammer three years prior, the way he conducted the murders matches the case descriptions exactly, he stole a car and he has called all of the missing girls.I was so angry at the end of the movie. I just wasted two hours with a movie about catching a brutal killer...he is caught...and then...lets just set him free to kill yet again in his unpatrolled empty neighborhood in broad daylight and then he walks back home to bury more dead bodies. RIDICULOUS!!!If you want to waste two hours with a ridiculous story about a murderer being treated like a princess, watch this.", "THE CHASER is a another example of the cutting edge of Asian cinema and its universal influence, especially on western cinema, as this is currently in the process of being set to be remade in Hollywood, by the team who created the INFERNAL AFFAIRS remake, THE DEPARTED. The story follows, Jung Ho, an ex cop who is now a pimp, and who is looking for two of his girls, who have disappeared. Unbeknowst to Jung, the girls have become victim to twisted serial killer, Young min, who Jung suspects to be instead a rival pimp, buying his girls off him, without his knowledge. Through a series of events Jung ho and Young min, clash into each other and eventually a chase and beating ensues with Young min, being taken to the local police station and eventually confessing to nine murders. The police task force behind the murder investigation strongly believe that he is the murderer and have 12 hours to find and gather evidence against him, or he will be set free without charge, and the same time Jung ho, has to look for another one of his girls Min jin who has become captive by the psychopath. Aside from a slow start the film really kicks in once Young min is detained and the police have 12 hours to build a case against him. At the same time, Jung ho's character undergoes a change from being a bit of a bastard to eventually setting out on a desperate effort to find Min jin, especially as he finds out and develops a kind of bond with her daughter. The performances are superb, and the portrayal of psycho Young min, is excellent as he is an instantly dislikeable person, who is playing the police at there own game and leading round in circles. The direction is tight and stylish, with some superb suspense and nail biting scenes, and there's also a strain of humour throughout the film that provide a slight relief from the dark undertone. Overall another strong and impressive entry that highlights the excellence and originality of Asian cinema.", "I watched this movie after reading the great reviews on this site and on netflix.Even though the movie is based upon a true story, the movie did not do any justice to it. All the characters are shown to be defying common sense things, creating ridiculously unbelievable situations. For example, the cops and the pimp are trying to search the victim bodies but they do not start from where the prostitute's car is parked.Similarly, even though the killer has confessed to the killings, the cops do not find it important to pursue the leads. The killer is shown to have blood on his shirt when he was arrested. He was in possession of someone else's vehicle, did not give his details correctly.. The movie shows that the cops ignored all of this. It is too damn stupid to digest. What a waste of time!", "Before watching this film, I had doubts in my mind whether to watch it or not.. the reason being, it's not in English. I thought why take trouble in watching a Korean film. I've checked IMDb and was stunned to see a 8.1 rating. Then I thought again.. this film must have been really good. I highly doubted that most of the films that are rated high didn't rhyme with my taste.Anyway.. I started watching this film. It started off slowly and as it progressed, I was amazed by the way the story unfolded, the way the director portrayed the characters. Everything was amazing. Acting was excellent and I just can't seem to find any shortcomings in the film.The climax was superb and I must say that Yeong-hie Seo, Jung-woo Ha & Yun-seok Kim deserve much of the praise for excellent acting.I'm sure that this film will be a good contender for the next Oscars. I highly recommend this film to everyone (above 15).", "Writer/director Hong-jin Na has a home run in his first outing. He not only gets a nomination at this year's Asian Film Awards, but the film also won seven 2008 Korean Film Awards including Best Picture, Director, Actor and Screenplay and was a massive box office hit in South Korea. It premiered at Cannes in the Official Selection and was quickly snapped up for an American remake by the producers of The Departed and Warner Brothers. I just hope they don't screw it up like they did with Infernal Affairs.Joong-ho (Yun-seok Kim) is a pimp that keeps losing his girls. They go out, but they don't come back. he doesn't know if they are running away or kidnapped and sold. The cops are too busy watching out for politicians to look for missing prostitutes.Fortunately, Joong-ho is a former cop and decides to solve the mystery himself. When he sends out Mi-jin (Yeong-hie Seo), he tags along. Unfortunately, he cannot save her from her fate, but he does find out who (Jung-woo Ha) is doing it; he just doesn't know yet what is being done.While Joong-ho is searching, he discovers that Mi-jin has a daughter and now he is stuck with her while he looks. She is cute and funny, so it really adds to the story. Of course, she is not funny when she realizes her mother is missing.Things take many twists and turns that add to the suspense. What is most upsetting is what happens while the cops are snoozing nearby.Outstanding writing and acting, and incredible suspense. A real winner from Korea that keeps you on the edge of your seat.", "\"Based on a true story, with the ULTIMATE GOAL of highlighting the flaws of the South Korean Police Force and the story of one of South Korea's most brutal serial killers..\" great quote... but not convincing... this movie made me suffer.. A LOT!! not because of violence, but of sheer stupidity.. and yeah of course: the police was stupid and that was one of the movies messages.. but come on, everyone involved is so damned stupid especially the useless hero.. it's unbelievable. and painful.kind of sad as the movie could have been quite good apart of being complete irritating nonsense...still a fan of korean flicks though.. i'll forgive this one.", "Avoid this film if you love great Korean films like OLDBOY. This is laughable and at some points I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a black comedy. Without giving anything away this film has the worst police ever. They make the most laughable mistakes. I cannot believe anybody in this film. Especially the lead. I don't know whether to hate him or love him so I did neither. His behaviour was contradictory and confusing. The action scenes in this film are poorly directed, in fact the whole thing is poorly directed. What a waste of 2 hours of my life. I like so many eastern films and am willing to forgive an awful lot. But this film is just terrible and I don't understand the great reviews it's getting. Avoid. Just watch OLDBOY again, if you need a Korean fix.", "This was a very dark movie, even by Korean standards. The movie starts of as a kind of black comedy. The protagonist is a pimp who has a hard time controlling his prostitutes. When one of his girls doesn't return, he believes that someone is picking them up and selling them. He calls his former buddies in the police force, that unfortunately is busy dealing with a case of someone throwing feces in the face of the city mayor. The comical mood changes when the perspective changes to one of his girls, who finds herself in a very creepy house with an even more creepy customer. This is not about a typical chase, where the protagonist has to track down and capture the antagonist. That all happens inside the first 15 minutes. This chase is about tracking down the girl, and later, about tracking down evidence in order to convict the antagonist. But it also becomes far more complicated than that. During this chase, you are really feeling the frustrations that the main character is having. You get equally mad at the incompetent police force, and you will feel a need to scream \"pick up the phone moron!\" or \"Noo, don't go in there!\" on several occasions. The chase scenes are very well done, and the action/fighting scenes are also very well done. They feel very realistic and are well choreographed (and violent). Also, the villain of this movie does not look like a villain. But you will still end up getting the chills every time he looks into the camera. The dialogue is harsh. It's mainly the protagonist throwing insults at the people he is encountering, it can be comical at times, but it can also be the exact opposite. No one is talking nice to each other in this movie.The cinematography is well done. It's a very dark toned movie, but that doesn't bring down the beautiful shots of the city (Seoul). It really helps set the correct mood for the movie.My only complaints would be that it becomes a little too long for it's own good, and some of the scenes felt a bit forced in order to finish the storyline.", "WHAT A WONDERFUL NEW YEARS 2012 PRESENT! I love movies, and this one ranks as GREAT in my book. It was shown at 2 AM Detroit time on the Sundance channel. I was asleep, turned over at about 2:05 AM, opened my eyes, focused on the TV and the Korean actor Kim Yoon-Seok (my TV watches me while I sleep), and was HOOKED for the next 2 hours. I agree with other reviewers who feel that this film gives you the same gut-punches and edge of your seat thrills as Silence of the Lambs. The bad guy gives Hannibal Lector a run for his money. In one scene, the little girls wide-mouth, seemingly endless wail is still rocking my world. If you love intelligent, realistic, (mostly, nothings perfect) thrilling cinema, watch this film at your earliest convenience. I am now off to find what other work this first-time director has done. He knocked it out of the park with this one.", "There is no plot, some shitty acts and a lunatic clueless killer, there is just blood all over the place with no reason or clear motivation. They pictured the police force like a bunch of mentally challenged, the only suspense that you feel throughout the movie is coming from the fact that the Police force is fooling around instead of following the clear clues to arrest the killer. If this picture from the police force has some reality in it then I feel sorry for the people living there. By the way, the ratio and the comments were all misleading. It looks like some comments has been written by people who had never watched a good crime thriller. Nowadays directors and the screen writers think to satisfy the audience they just need to depict a crazy guy killing and axing innocents brutally; they do not trouble themselves by making a character believable. That's not art and it's not entertaining. I am wondering when we will be able to see a real crime movie with a good plot and crew like David Fincher's Seven!? so my friends do not let the rating and earlier comments fool you this is a total waste of time.", "I usually quite like Korean films, whether they're horror films or just about everyday life. Don't ask me to name any, because I can't. I really liked the first few minutes of this and expected a good quality whodunnit with a bit of bloodshed. Hopefully the cute lady with the daughter would be rescued in the nick of time and reunited with her daughter and the bad guy would be locked up and everyone would end up happy.After suffering 45 minutes of incompetent clowns shouting at each other, allowing a self-confessed killer to occupy the police office alone with a female officer, wasting time and behaving like complete imbeciles, I fast forwarded through the rest to find the happy ending and get on with my life.Sadly (and I mean that literally) I did not find that happy ending and so I remain disgusted with this pathetic, rambling, laughable shambles of a film. It does nothing to promote Korean society and should be buried in the world cinema graveyard - preferably after being cut into small pieces first. Maybe feed it to ravenous dogs. You get the picture.", "I'm a person who hates bulls**t. And this movie is full of it. Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is pretty good. Let me explain.Here be spoilers. The movie is about a pimp whose girls go missing one after another. The pimp is also an ex-detective. After sending one of his last girls to a client, he suspects said client to be the cause of his troubles. At this point in the movie, though, he still thinks that the 'client' kidnaps his girls and sells them elsewhere. Long story short, the ex-detective pimp starts searching for the girl-abductor, accidentally bumps into him, they end up at the police station, and that's where the movie starts going downhill.Question: what should the police do after they apprehend two men who fought each other after a common car accident, and after one of them, in the presence of at least 3-4 other policemen (can't recall now), commits to having murdered 12 women? Did I mention that the police are also looking for an unknown serial killer known for at least 3 homicides? The guy continues to mention in great detail how he killed the women (all details match police records), he has blood all over his shirt, was apprehended while driving \"a friend's\" car (he forgot the friend's name, how unfortunate), doesn't have any form of ID, \"can't remember\" where he lives, etc. All the while the other guy, the detective-pimp, is shouting from the other side of the room that the 'client' abducted his women. Surely, this is no difficult puzzle. If you're a sane person and answered at least, \"put him behind bars until everything's cleared out\" - you're wrong. It appears that the policemen are most concerned not about the fact that they have a serial killer in their station, but that said serial killer is badly bruised. I'm not kidding, the cops' main topic of discussion is how they will explain to the press why the guy is beat up like that (the pimp did it). So they do the next best thing - leave him alone in an office-like room with what seems a 90 pound woman, who is more interesting in typing up something on her computer, than watching a serial killer who IS STILL NOT BEHIND BARS, but on a chair in the middle of the office-room. Apparently, they don't have jails in Korea. The police fail to gather any evidence (it's the middle of the night, and to be honest, they're not really trying), so they let the man go some 12 hours later.Next problem: you're the pimp. You found where the guy lives, finally. You fight. You throw the serial killer on the floor and choke him for 5 seconds. What do you do next? If you're thinking - check if he's dead or keep choking for a few more seconds just to be sure --- you can't be more wrong. Apparently, what you do is you get up, look to the side and stare at an aquarium some 5-6 metres away, for some time. Just enough time for the serial killer to regain consciousness. I could go on. I refuse to believe that people in Korea are that stupid. The film is filled with one logical fallacy after another, it's just horrendous. Everyone is an idiot, incapable of logic thought, everyone seems to have their heads in the clouds, missing the point. The prosecutor, who should be the one man most interested in catching a serial killer, gives the following reasoning to let him go: previously that evening, a crazy person smeared feces on the city mayor, and one of the policemen was unofficially held responsible for not preventing the event. Because the same policeman was in the room at the police station with the suspect serial killer, the killer should be let go, so as to not make it seem that the station is desperate to hide the feces smearing event. As in, they're trying to blame the innocent man of the murders so the public would not focus on a cop who let his guard down which ended up in the politician being humiliated. Seriously? The only thing that saved it was the ending, hence the three stars.", "When I heard that this movie was going to be remade by the crew that brought us The Departed, I decided to check it out. The movie was critically acclaimed everywhere; even internationally. Oh boy are we in for some surprises.The movie has a very dark tone and it instantly sucks the audience into the plot. The whole plot is simplistic while disturbing and sets up a good exposition. The Chaser starts out well paced and engaging but it starts to lose focus during the second act. A lot of the suspense is dropped and it becomes a flat investigation plot that runs in circles.Rather than external anxiety, the majority of the suspense comes from the atmosphere itself. The movie is very suspenseful and horrific when it's supposed to be but it doesn't occur as often as it should. This is the reason why the climax didn't do it for me. The movie doesn't keep building and by the end it's just a violent dog fight.Most of the violence is not directly shown and is edited so that the audience can use their imagination. Points for that.The audience can relate to the characters and feel sympathetic throughout the film. The movie can be funny when it wants to be from time to time; there are some cute moments here and there especially with the child actor accompanying the protagonist. But I just hate s*** like that (when Korean movies try to add humor to a serious movie). All the characters are distinguishable at a first glimpse. The characters have a lot to work with which is why the actors do a pretty good job.The main problem with this movie is that the protagonist and the antagonist don't conflict throughout the movie as much they should. The antagonist doesn't propose much of a threat except in the exposition and the climax. He is rather a spectator and I felt that the interaction between the two was missing.The ending was subjectively bad for me. It's somewhat of a surprise and I like how it's clich\u00e9 free. However it all comes down to the point where I just don't care about anything anymore.It's not a bad film but it's certainly overrated. Hopefully the remake is better."], "809": [], "810": ["A Gentleman's Dignity is a 24 episode Korean drama that is fun and breezy without much angst. This cotton candy show features an amusing foursome that have been friends since high school. I enjoyed the four friends and their bromance and when the show focused on their insecurities and concerns. Each guy was different and grew on you throughout the series. When the show focused on their friendship, it delivered with upfront and sometimes amusing slices of issues of the modern man. The show had charm, and the actors were willing to look silly when the script called for it. Each episode began with a shared experience from their past as friends. It was amusing watching these 40 something actors pretend to be in high school in some of these flashbacks.Our four friends:a. Do-jin was a confidence character that was surprised by love and love that he had to work to earn as his lady of choice initially cared about another of the foursome. There was a great romantic moment when he gave the woman he loved a fabulous pair of shoes and told her to wear them when she was ready to accept him and his love.b. Tae-san was the chauvinist, dominating guy who bossed around his sister and lady love but had a sweet side too. His willingness to accept his feisty lady love's priority of her career over marriage showed he did want her happiness.c. Choi Yoon played by Kim Min-jong was the widower that was hotly pursued by Tae-san's sister 20 years his junior. His unwillingness to engage in romance with her is understandable though he eventually decides he is ready for love.d. Jung-rok was the fluff character of the bunch. Spoiled, womanizing, but with charm and love for his wife. Getting her to believe that he loved her and would stop his womanizing ways was a tough sell.I was less enamored of the women in their lives:1. Yi-soo was a high school teacher that loved her students and was honest and forthright. She took her time falling for Do-jin. I felt the actress over acted sometimes but it was consistent throughout the series, perhaps she was directed to deliver that performance. The character's acceptance of his surprise son from a youthful relationship was good, though this was not horrible in my mind but it was portrayed as a negative and shameful.2. Se-ra was prickly, viewed other women as rivals not friends, and focused on her golfing career. Initially this character was off putting but grew on me throughout the series.3. Min-sook was the brittle, tough wife of Jung-rok who was mistrustful of her husband due to his past dalliances. This character was tough but caring. I was a fan of this character at the end of the series.4. Meari was difficult to watch. Over emoting, tons of ugly crying, and no character growth at all. Her goal in life was getting Choi Yoon to love her and her brother to accept the possibility of this relationship. That's all you got out of this character for 24 episodes.", "Not very common type of story in korean drama. No complaints on actors. Worth to have a watch."], "811": [], "812": [], "813": [], "814": [], "815": [], "816": [], "817": [], "818": [], "819": [], "820": [], "821": [], "822": [], "823": ["Yes it is.He has lost his job and takes care of the household and the baby. She is a director at an English language school and has an affair with her first lover. It's a linear story with an inevitable ending, told with eye for detail and with humour. Although the story and setting are not new, it has a surprising ending, which is emphasized by the words 'happy end'.", "Happy End is a South Korean film about a woman who's having an affair while her husband is unemployed.It stars Choi Min-sik, Jeon Do-yeon and Ju Jin-mo.It was written and directed by Jung Ji-woo.In the movie,Bora is a successful career woman who becomes involved with her destructive ex-lover, Kim. Bora's home life is a snore: she's mother to an infant child and her husband, Seo has lost his job, leaving Bora as the family's sole breadwinner. The jobless Seo hasn't been just wandering around parks and reading romance novels as first thought.One day, Min-ki accidentally stumbles upon a key, that belongs to his wife, and is unfamiliar that realizes that something is going on, and he's collecting evidence.Happy End centers namely Bora,Kim and Min-ki.They are imperfect people but not despicable human beings. They are all very much human in every way that matters. As a result of all of these humanly needs and wants, Bora is unable to stop going back to Kim even though she seems physically and emotionally damaged by their continued affair. Kim has realized that he is hooked on her, and is very aware of his (jealously- driven) actions toward her and her family. Without each other, they have no passion in their life, and so they must keep going back to each other.While Min-ki is depressed with his inability to find a job and stuck who so-called \"feminine\" chores like grocery shopping, cooking, and doing the laundry.Unfortunately,this is a big letdown especially in a patriarchal Korean society.Aside from that,it also damages his confidence that his wife has lost interest in him.The movie tries to bring these people to the viewers and the humanity of these characters.Also,it brings about how these people are susceptible to wrong doings and immoral acts brought about by their weaknesses and their situations in life.The film has explicit sex scenes and violent acts.But overall,it was an exploration of human behavior in the three main characters presented in it.What makes this film effective as well is the brilliant acting of the actors and actress involved which makes it absorbing from beginning to end.I definitely would recommend this to anyone who loves great films.", "I believe this is the fourth or fifth film I've watched starring Min-Sik Choi, who is quite an accomplished actor. The DVD cover proclaims Happy End to be \"one of the most controversial Korean films ever made!\" It's not difficult to imagine why this film might cause controversy. On the one hand, shortly after the film begins, a semi-explicit sex scene takes place that seems to go on for a gratuitously long time. But nothing is shown during the sex scenes that wasn't shown in the much less controversial, more traditional Korean period piece, Chunhyang. Perhaps it is the nature of the sex taking place, that of illicit extramarital liaisons, that contributed to its controversy. But I believe the bulk of the film's controversy is due to what ultimately emerges as the film's theme.This film could be viewed as a sadistic wet dream pandering to certain men who are disgruntled by what they feel is an emasculating and increasingly common situation of this modern age: that of the unemployed, stay-at-home husband. Except that when this unemployed husband is home, he spends most of his time watching soap operas, only occasionally lifting a finger to help with the baby. Instead of looking for work, he kills time each day crouched in the used book store, reading romance novels, to the chagrin of the store owner, whose policy regarding such patrons is less welcoming than that of Barnes & Noble. The husband is mopey, and never expresses affection towards or sexual attraction to his wife. Since he barely helps out around the house, when his wife gets home from work she ends up having to do the cleaning and the chores on top of her job, even though he has much more free time and is home much more than she is. As a companion, he is ineffectual and impotent. At one point during the final third of the film, as she's alone at home on her hands and knees scrubbing the floor, she tells herself that she has to \"end it\". It's unclear at the time whether she's talking about her relationship with her husband, or with her co-worker Il-bum. For the most part, she endures the imbalance in her relationship with her husband without much complaint, perhaps contritely due to a sense of guilt she possesses over the fact that she is engaged in an affair.It's revealed that Il-Bum is actually baby Yun's father, and that they were a couple before her current husband came into her life and married her. Why would she leave her former lover to be with such a pathetic, and ultimately deranged and lethal man? There is an indication that at one time he was successful and financially more secure. But her past and present boyfriend is more attractive, more passionate, and more considerate. For reasons that aren't fully explained, she reacts negatively to his small, caring gestures. When he buys a toothbrush that she can use when she's over at his place, she lashes out. She does the same when she discovers toys that he's bought for the baby. She seems conflicted by emotions of desire, guilt, and annoyance with both the men in her life and her situation in general. There is also at least one major plot hole in this film that I could not overlook. At one point near the end of the film, she mixes a bit of sleeping medication into her baby's formula, so that she can leave her in the apartment to go confront her lover and break off their relationship. But her husband could come home at any minute, and yet she apparently doesn't stop to consider that. Perhaps the simple, though inadequate answer to the questions raised by her acts is that she just isn't a very sensible woman. But nor is she portrayed as being mentally slow. Distracted, certainly.Inevitably, her husband comes home to find the baby there alone, and eventually discovers that he's being cheated on. He premeditates a vicious revenge, in which he terrifies her before committing brutal murder, bludgeoning her over and over with her lover's knife which he stole from the former's home, gradually slowing to pause and stare at the body for a couple moments in between stabs. He then uses the weapon to frame her lover for the murder he's committed. The last time we see Il-Bum is in custody, being pressured into giving up his right to remain silent without a lawyer. We're only left to imagine what becomes of him.There's a misanthropic sense of self-satisfaction in the supposedly \"clever\" irony of the film's title. Not knowing what the filmmaker's intentions were, I'm led to wonder after watching this film if those who wrote and directed it consider the end which befell Bora and her child's true father to be a \"happy\" one. The superior tone of one of the previous comments here glibly indicates with a wink and a nod that she deserved to be horribly and brutally slayed by her baby's \"touching motherly daddy\" because SHE'D gone too far. How alarmingly vile.", "I am into korean cinema. They have been giving me some of the deepest experiences with recent years cinema. From the current crop of (at least) competent korean filmmakers, we have Wook-Park and Kim Ki-Duk. Both of them have added value to my life with some of their films. Apart from them i found lots of competence and thrill in other films from there.Now i saw this. It's impressive, not powerful and life-altering like Oldboy or Bin-jip but still worthy.Let me remark on how this is built. The film begins and (practically) ends with 2 really exaggerated and intense scenes: it starts with a visceral obsessed sex scene and ends with a brutal killing. Both are enhanced beyond what was need to make a statement and both go a little bit beyond what we would normally tolerate in such scenes. In the middle of these scenes, we are given scenes of common, even dull daily routine. Cooking, nursering, reading, working, eating. Just that. So, the scenes are extreme moments of ordinary lives. It's what the film is about. The killing is an exaggerated, violent and uncommon reaction to a relatively ordinary situation of adultery. The film visually corresponds to this, so we have a case of great adequation between what we see and what we are told. That is good enough to please me.This is flawed in the way it purely relies on the effect these scenes should have on you. The risks are minimized to those two scenes and controversy they might (and did) cause. Well, i think the film works relatively well, but the scenes didn't shock me so much (the last 10 years gave us films like Irreversible). Still, what stays is good experience, because the whole film is about making us numb and unreactive, and than shake us and suddenly wake us up. It's relatively thin but it works, and most of all, it does it cinematically, it does it in the eye.The artistic work is great. The cinematography is perfectly aware of colours, saturations, and composition elements. It's beautiful, and something we see over and over in every korean film, even the worst ones. Visually, korean cinema doesn't seem to be as depurated and abstract as Japanese imagery, instead it is a pleasant relaxed depiction of beauty, with western concepts and influences and, yet, very rooted in an eastern society. I suppose it corresponds to where South Korea stands culturally these days.My opinion: 3/5", "An excellently performed movie about our age of the equality of the genders. If men lose their jobs and their wives have wild affairs can a man forever hold his horses? An original story with a touching motherly daddy who knows when enough is enough...", "Happy End is a wonderful, yet frightening, look at what a love triangle does for the people involved. Noted for its twist ending, the film begs the question of whether the drastic choices we make (although in very painful situations) really benefit our lives in any way. Ji-woo Chung's intimate approach to this film lets the viewer really look inside the characters and their motivations. Choi Min-sik gives a great performance, right up there with Oldboy and Failan. I don't know if there is another actor in the world that can get so much sympathy from his audience. A really great film, coming from a country that makes one great film after another.", "Seo was a kind middle-aged man. He had a competent wife and a cute daughter. Due to enough financial support from his wife, he was not so anxious to seek a job. On the contrary he led a lazy life by reading novels. Of cause he had to spend some time on looking after his young daughter. One day he accidentally found that one of keys that belonged to his wife was strange. He began to doubt the loyalty of his wife. A family crisis occurred.The unexpected ending was powerful and shocking. Extra-martial affair is bad in my eyes. It not only breaks a family but also brings agony to other people. If you did it and caused bad outcome, you had nobody to blame but yourself.Min-sik Choi convincingly played a desperate husband. I think that he is one of the best Korean actors. He also left me deep impression in Oldboy, Springtime.An excellent Korean drama. 8/10", "Some films need no elaborate critiques so just a brief note on Chung Ji Woo's \"Happy End\": Yes, it has an ironic title, it may be misogynistic (I personally don't think it is), it's one of the most controversial South Korean films, and it's probably a commentary on gender roles as the country evolves. Or we can just simply say that this film has damn good sex scenes. Period. There are no profound truths, just a hot guy, Il-Beom (Ju Jin-Mo, star of Kim Ki-Duk's \"Real Fiction\"), and a cute girl, Bora (Jeon Do-Yeon), f%^@#$ each other like there's no tomorrow. The shameless, illicit nature of the sex heightens the eroticism: the adulterer is a woman who sneaks around for sex while her jobless husband sits at home with their infant and watches soap operas. The power b*tch f%@#s around! There's no frontal nudity and there's only 2 sex scenes but 2 things more than make up for it: the first sex scene is done in pretty much 1 (well-done) long take and handsome Ju Jin-Mo's beautiful naturally lean frame (and derri\u00e8re) in motion is just beautiful.", "**spoiler**. This is a simple story that has some great acting in it. One of those movies where at the end, you just say, 'woah'. This is all I recall about the movie, and it has been about 4 years since I last saw it. I remember being able to empathize with the main character. And from the viewpoint of the husband, it is a happy ending. He got rid of the wife who betrayed him and kept his baby whom he loved. I was glad he 'got away'...you are suppose to be. He cries at the end out of happiness that he still has his baby. He was a good guy, totally not appreciated, follows all the rules, does all his duties, is kind to others, especially his wife. He's a nice guy, who's finishing last. I think the whole scene with his wife with her lover on his bed while he was under the bed just simply traumatized his. He went overboard. He went down the 'other' darker path. Face it folks, if he instead decided to not get 'bloody' and instead, go to court, divorce and fight over the child for the rest of his life, like most people do, then we wouldn't have a movie would we? Anyways, if want to see Disney-like happy Korean movies there's plenty of them. Would you go see one? Go then, you can see one at anytime. Here's a little movie that went the other way, and this is why it's different.", "\"Happy End\" is a movie about a women who is having an affair and how the husband takes matter into his own hands.

First of all the scenery was winter which made it perfect for the characters to dress fashionably. The characters were also really cool. I liked the way the characters were all very extreme, and that there were no boring characters. You either liked the character in the drama or you hated their guts. The music (noon ae kouth \"snow flower\") in this drama is awesome too.In addition, this series is not too long (16 episodes), so you could watch it in just one day. The drama is good from the start, but there was one part that I did not like, which was the episodes 11 and 12. But the ending of episode 12... !!! but the ending of episode 12 really gets you back into the series. Another thing that I did not like about the series was that in about 2 scenes the microphone can be seen. However, this drama is truly still the best I have ever scene and I have shown this drama to my family and friends, and none have not liked it.

The storyline is unique and the acting by the two main leads are nothing short of outstanding. It focuses on a mother's love for her child and how human beings are inevitably, soft-hearted creatures.This Drama originally planned to be screened only for 16 episodes, the netizens of Korea demanded an extension and KBS complied by asking the drama's directors and producers to extend by another 4 episodes. However, the makers of the drama refused and said they couldn't and quite frankly, I'm happy they did. In fact, the drama was so popular that KBS even issued a second OST album for it due to overwhelming response. Not to mention that the last two episodes were so sad, that even the makers of the drama couldn't help but cry when the scenes were played out I don't have the vocabulary to describe So Ji Sup's performance in 'Misa'. I had watched him in 'Memories of Bali' and always knew that he was good. But this time he really outdid all of us.So Ji Sup is just perfect for Cha Moo Hyuk With comparisons to her co-star, I loved Im Soo Jung from top to bottom. She was very much what her character required to portray: A simple-minded girl without her own dreams. In the beginning, Eun Chae desired whatever Choi Yoon desired, because Choi Yoon was the epitome of her life. But once she got to know Moo Hyuk, that changed forever. \"I'm Sorry I Love You\" has a deeper meaning throughout the normal K-dramas we see about love. It dwells more on the humanity of a person", "I'm Sorry, I Love You (2004) was a 16 episode, huge television hit series made by Koreans, but popular all throughout the Asian world.Slightly soap-opera-ish in nature, it is an extremely addictive show because it develops its plot lines slowly and you really begin to care about the characters. The leads are all very attractive people (especially the awesome and incredibly handsome Ji-seob So as Mu-hyeok and the little dynamo Su-jeong Im, who was great in the Korean hit film A Tale Of Two Sisters), and their acting is realistic and evocatively emotional, and often funny as well. The music is beautiful too and the production values are excellent. It was filmed in Australia and Korea.It's the story of a petty gangster, Mu-hyeok - a street hustler growing up homeless in Australia, who is shot in the head at the wedding of a woman he loved. She was marrying a rich gangster for his money, yet Mu-hyeok, still deeply in love with her, risks his own life to save hers when an assassin shows up to kill the wedding couple.The doctors cannot remove the bullet in Mu-hyeok's brain, and they give him only a few months to live. The woman he saved gives him a lot of money and tells him to return to his homeland of Korea to die. He goes and makes a search for his birth mother whom he believes gave him up for adoption because of financial hardship. When he finds her he is shocked to discover she is rich, has another son, and so he doesn't reveal to her his identity but instead plans his revenge on her.Along the way he discovers he has a twin sister, and he falls in love with a gentle girl named Eunchae Song who works for his step-brother. Over time he begins a mellowing process. Will he cling to bitterness until the end of his life, or will he find the grace to forgive those he believed wronged him? Many surprises are in store for the viewer during this series, right up to the last scenes. There is also some wonderful humor to relieve the dramatic tension. I really loved this show and everyone I have recommended it to has become as hooked as I was! It's just as addictive as those famous British - PBS series such as Upstairs, Downstairs or The Forsyte Saga or The Duchess of Duke Street! Except the stars are all Korean! Now, there are several ways to buy this awesome series. You can order each episode off Amazon On Demand for $1.99 each, but the files have DRM copyright protection on them so you'll only be able to watch them on your computer. These are good quality files with excellent white subtitles in English.Or you can buy a 9 disc box set from KBSDVD, which is out of print now but worth tracking down because it has the best images (though the subtitles are not as good as the Amazon video files).Then there is another KBS release that is only 2 discs, but the images have been condensed to MPEG1 files instead of proper MPEG2 files, so I suggest you avoid this one. The yellow subtitles in this box-set are terrible in comparison to your other options. Ask the seller how many discs are in the set you wish to buy.Yet another box-set with 7 DVDs is available in Korea, but you're not going to find that selling here in the States because it is Region 3.However you track it down, don't miss it. It's literally the most addictive show I've watched in years and years. I love it! 10 stars out of 10.", "A soulful performance by the lead actor So Ji Sub makes this series worth watching. This could have been your average Korean melodrama however, the sincere, soulful and heartfelt performance by So Ji Sub elevates this melodrama to the highest degree. \"Sorry, I Love You\" is a journey of a young man who transforms from a minor vengeful petty thief into a decent caring human being. So Ji Sub's transformation throughout the series is quite remarkable, he displays great sadness and longing for love and acceptance. Lim Su-jeong who plays the unlikely love interest also gives a tender and genuine performance. Overall, the series has a rather karmic and dark message about \"whatever comes around goes around\". Su-jeong's father ends up suffering the most for giving up the twin babies and keeping the secret from the lead character's mother. It's not your average K-Drama the message of the drama is at the very end of the series. Great story writing and great acting by So Ji Sub makes this series one of the best K-Dramas. It's definitely worth watching.", "Please notice the spoiler alert. You do not want to read this if you haven't seen this wonderful show.As I have noticed in other Korean dramas, this one, too, attempts to tackle a social problem that arises in societies where kinship and social status based on family background are important. Here, too, we have fractured families with adopted, abandoned, widowed, or orphaned members. The only intact family is the one of the female lead (Song Eun-Chae, portrayed by the excellent Im Soo Jung), whose father bears the burden of holding the information that would have made the male lead (Cha Moo-Hyuk, played by the incredibly handsome So Ji-seob) stop hating his biological mother, and whose mother is a bitter shrew; so this family is outwardly intact, but inwardly fragmented. The search for family acceptance and love is paramount. Moo-Hyuk is a lonely and homeless outcast who preys on hapless female Asian tourists in Australia; his only emotional anchor is another Korean who marries a rich Australian for his money. As explained in another review, Moo-Hyuk gets to see Korea to find his mother during his last few months of life. Through a series of rather implausible events, he does find his biological mother, but also finds out -- erroneously -- that she abandoned him and a twin sister at birth. Bent on revenge, he focuses on whom he presumes to be his half-brother, Yune. He insinuates himself into Yune's life, almost lets him drown, watches as Yune's stylist (Eun-Chae) gets beaten up, and seduces Yune's girlfriend, until Yune loses his cool, gets into a car wreck, and is found to have a defective heart. When both Yune and Moo-Hyuk find out that they love the same girl, Eun-Chae, a terribly destructive struggle ensues that is centered on another Korean social value and thus problem: loyalty. Eun-Chae has grown up with Yune, has always been seen like a little sister by him, and is tied to him through her parents who work for Yune's mother, her own job working for Yune, and her secret crush on him. It is not until Moo-Hyuk intervenes that she realizes that she has choices in her life beyond those dictated by family ties and life history. It takes her a good amount of time, but after much agonizing, she finally chooses to be with Moo-Hyuk. He, however, cannot really set Eun-Chae free because he chooses not to let her come too close to him so that he can protect her from the certain heartbreak she would have to endure upon his impending death. Besides seeing So Ji-seob's and Im Soo Jung's superb acting, I enjoyed watching the character development of Yune (a supremely spoiled pop star), his mother (an egocentric woman clutching success), his former girlfriend (a nympho-manic starlet) and Eun-Chae's father (an unfailingly loyal chauffeur). All of them \"grow up\" by realizing their short-comings -- and it is through the homeless petty criminal Moo-Hyuk whose heart (!) was larger than theirs. Since Eun-Chae could not consummate her love with Moo-Hyuk, she commits suicide one year after his death, thus fulfilling her prophecy that they were not meant to be together in this life. I, too, grew from watching this story. My husband of two decades is here, not fatally injured, and we have sort of neglected each other's company. I better show him my love before we're in another world...", "This series is full of cliches but still somehow it tells a very special and realistic story that finds a way to touch your heart and God... hurts it!\nThe acting, chemistry between the leads and the soundtrack (snow flower) was all so good!The story takes you in and before you know, you are feeling that broken heart pain!

She seemed lack in pride but it could be just the nature of extreme youth.

A must watch!"], "834": [], "835": [], "836": ["Rooftop Prince is a Korean melodrama that aired earlier this year (2012). It's another fantasy/time travel romantic drama that deals with reincarnation and circular themes that are common to many Asian productions.SPOILERS AHEAD!Your story begins with a prince in Joseon era (Korea; approximately 300 years or so ago) who dotes on his wife, but he also clearly has some interest in her sister. The sister was actually the one who was supposed to be the princess, but she got scarred in an \"accident\" before the engagement and was thus no longer deemed \"suitable\" to be the future queen. All is going along well enough, until the princess is found dead one night, drowned in a lake under suspicious circumstances. The prince sets off to investigate what happened and rounds up 3 people to help him (a legendary fighter, a brilliant scholar, and a cross dresser who hears all rumors and secrets in town). While investigating the mystery, the 4 of them are somehow transported to modern day Korea (via some magical once in a life time lunar eclipse or something).While this is happening, there's a 2nd story taking place in modern day Korea. Two stepsisters are brought together when a widowed/divorced man & women meet. The older stepsister doesn't like this arrangement a whole lot, and she makes an impulsive decision to abandon her younger stepsister one day. The younger sister is orphaned then eventually adopted and relocated to America where she grows up not knowing/remembering her parents or what happened to her. Once grown, the adopted sister sets off to find her real parents and learn more about her history. So, she travels back to Korea where she and her stepsister are reunited. Now, your \"gimmick\" here is that the 2 lead actresses play the roles of each sets of sisters in both the past and the present, and one of the sisters wronged the other during their youth in each time period. The prince from the past also plays another character who is the missing son of a wealthy family in the present; this makes for great karmic drama & intrigue that only adds to the overall entertainment value of this show. Korean melodramas have been pushing these dual role/character/timeline plots quite a bit lately, to a pretty fair degree of success, and it's easy to see why; this breaks up the status quo monotony, allows for actors to perform diversely, gives the writers and directors a chance to be creative, etc. I can easily foresee the day (probably very soon) when these productions will further expand upon this format by incorporating 3 roles/stories at once.As the story unfolds, our 4 men from the past are transported to the roof top of the adopted sister's tiny apartment in modern day Korea. These men were the \"cream of the crop\" at their specific skill set in the past, but are totally incompetent when faced with modern day tasks; they can't even figure out how to feed themselves, much less understand how a toilet, elevator, TV, etc works. Our young heroine (the adopted sister) takes them in like a litter of lost puppies and puts them to work while she teaches them about the modern world they now inhabit. The prince is not used to living as a pauper though, or communicating with an independent woman in a modern society, so there's some friction between the two main characters to begin with. Soon enough though, the time travelers start to adapt to their new life, the prince becomes more involved with the 2 sisters in the present, and well, it doesn't take a genius to figure out where all this is headed. This show has what you're looking for if you're a fan of this genre, and, as a bonus, it's mostly accessible to those who aren't 'fans'. You've got your dual back & forth love stories between and among the 4 protagonists, your manipulative male and female antagonists, plenty of fist clinching/hand wringing, family business/power struggles, growth and eventual acceptance between family members, etc.The never ending Korean well, from which talented gorgeous women & hunky dudes seem to spring from, is still overflowing. The more put together or sexy characters are the meaner people, and the cuter ones are the nicer people, as usual. The main mean dude is ridiculously good looking, and, it's a shame the mean female lead didn't get to play the nice sister as her brilliant smile just lights up a room. It's almost impossible to not draw comparisons between this show and \"Queen In Hyun's Man\"; both shows aired very close in time to each other, and each feature noble men from Joseon era who travel forward in time to modern day Korea. Intrigue, hijinks, drama, & romance ensue; you know the deal by now if you've seen a few KTV melodramas. \"Rooftop\" has more of a typical K-drama aesthetic to it in both production values and storytelling than does \"Queen\", and it is by far the more soap opera-ish of the two, whereas \"Queen\" takes a more stylized and slicker approach that's more similar to a well polished movie. \"Queen\" is also much better written than \"Rooftop\" IMO. That's no knock on \"Rooftop\" though, as this show is pretty entertaining. It is often sillier and more comedic in tone than \"Queen\", and it almost runs off the rails a few times and does get a little too over the top and repetitive as it progresses, but that's the way it goes. Which one is better?...that probably depends on what you're looking for, or typically like. I personally prefer \"Queen\", and I do feel it is by far the better of the two overall (for my tastes), but you likely can't go wrong with \"Rooftop\" either, and I liked it well enough.Final Score: 7 out of 10 stars. I can't justify giving it any higher rating than that. It's fairly enjoyable overall.", "I tend to enjoy a good time travel movie and as a Netflix subscriber, I get recommendations based on other things I have watched. Rooftop Prince was a Netflix recommendation. The idea of a Korean TV show with subtitles didn't seem like something I would care much about, but it wouldn't hurt to watch the first episode and see. That is what I did and I got hooked immediately.Some of the things I found so refreshing about this show is #1-it is clean. No offensive joking or language. #2-it is hilarious at times and thrilling at other times. It has everything a good drama should have--greed, murder, mystery, romance, wealth and yet much of the time, it was very sweet. Throwing in some reincarnation and time travel just ices the cake for me. I love it. The two main characters (romantic) have a tremendous chemistry together. I would love to see them both again.I binge watched all 20 episodes and I may watch them all again. At times the dialog went by too fast with the subtitles, I couldn't read it, but most of the time I was able to understand what was going on.Each episode leaves you with a cliffhanger. Everything is concluded satisfactorily at last episode. Each episode is about an hour and 4 minutes long. I don't really get that odd amount of time. Here a TV show is fitted into an hour with commercials, generally so it might be 42 minutes without commercials. I wonder how they fit their TV shows in Korea for watching?I gave it 10 stars because it was so enjoyable and addictive. I am going through withdrawal now that I am done watching it. In my opinion, there is nothing this entertaining on American TV lately.", "The plot is creative, with a constant shift from modern to ancient to modern. This setting itself keeps you out of boredness. Male lead is sometimes expressionless, but this suit the role as a stern king. His assistants, on the contrary, acts well and funny.Towards the end the story it is a bit illogical. Still, it is a drama worthwhile to see.", "The first episodes of the drama I was laughing so much; But then It got kind of serious and little sad. The drama is mix of comedy, tragedy, and mystery. I liked all the main characters some of the episodes made me so nerves, some excited, while others irritated me. I cried, laughed, and was moved with the characters. The ending was nice, realistic and acceptable.", "Rooftop Prince is a classic K Drama that one should watch, although, the further you are in your K drama experiance, the least good you'll find this one. First of all, the idea was interesting and entertaining, with the romance good enough to keep things interesting till the end. The past story was okay too and the family drama was good as well, with enough drama to keep you going. But, the drama was full of cliches, with the missing daughter, the evil male rival, the rich grandmother etc etc. At least the theme was original. In addition, the length was too much, as it could have been a few episodes sort. And yet, the ending was a bit too quick, leaving things hanging. So, 5 out of 10.", "Fassbinder's Berlin Alexanderplatz (1980) was a long movie - over 15 hours long. The Thornbirds, Roots and other early TV mini-series were long movies broken into consecutive episodes. I love a mini-series as a melodrama that tells a story in the long movie format, as opposed to those that tell different stories in the same setting (like Grey's Anatomy, Mad Men and to a lesser extent Damages, Breaking Bad, and Revenge that change the story at times while keeping to a general story). In this regard, I have discovered some gems in the South Korean TV mini-series of recent years.The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back. This me recur in the same story. Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved. If personality dynamics are properly depicted in a valid manner, and if the production is skillful, then powerful emotions can be evoked in the viewer. In this way we can live many lifetimes through movies, in our one lifetime - greatly enriching our incarnate experience.These South Korean productions (seen on Netflix streaming) are first class with excellent production and direction, some terrific casting and acting (particularly from some of the females who give some matchless world class performances), brilliant musical accompaniment, and staging. What makes these so good is the way they skillfully evoke deep emotion in the viewer. South Korean movie making is superb - world class.However, the following caveats must be considered by the USA viewer. They are subtitled and some people hate this. The South Korean cultural norms, values and sanctions may sometimes seems silly or old fashioned to the USA viewer. The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation/unity - sometimes reminiscence of a old Frank Capra film.Most importantly, in order for the sometimes complicated sub-plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing, and this leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people, that sometimes seem to be unlikely by USA cultural standards. The viewer may wonder at times why good but trusting people are so easily manipulated and deceived by bad and selfish people, but con artists do often succeed (just look at politicians for example). However this poetic license of improbability is needed to develop the story - just accept it as occurring even though unlikely at times. Taking these factors into account Will help you become involved and emotionally engrossed. It was hard t for me to quit watching at times so I binged watched.I would rank these as follows but tastes differ and your rankings might not agree: 1 - 4 (hard to say which is best)Shining InheritanceWhen a Man LovesThat Winter, The Wind BlowsSecret Garden5. Five Fingers6. The Scent of a Woman7. The Great Queen Seondeok8. A Hundred Years Inheritance9. Lie To me10. Roof Top Prince11. Dr. Jin12. The Great DoctorRooftop Prince has a fantasy premise - a Prince and his immediate staff experience time travel into the present day from the past. Then it becomes a mixture of melodrama and fun. Time travel is rare but has been reported by reputable people. See J. Randles book, Time Slips, for more on this. Accept the fantasy and enjoy the fun.", "This drama is funny yet romantic at the same time. OK so at first I really don't have an interest to watch this drama because Yoochun looks ugly here but the he turned out to be different, he was masculine, clever, and saddening at the same time hence show his handsomeness and manliness at the same time (any woman watch this will be melting by his way of treating his lover). I'm not commenting his good acting because he is one of kpop group legend singer DBSK but because his truly deep brilliant acting that can make me stay to watch this drama. Han Ji Min is a good actress and she is lucky to have a good acting partner with Yoochun while Park min Young from \"syungkyungkwan scandal\" can't acting at all. I won't watch it if the main actor acting is not strong since the plot is ordinary and predictable. The plot is OK and it's common but after all the plot is not easy to guess and all the actors fighting hard to show their best here. This is not so a happy ending typical drama but really worth to watch I would say it's the best drama of 2012 even \"innocent man\" from KBS cannot beat this.The soundtrack by Baek Ji Young \"after a long time has pass\" is good but boring. There is \"I don't like love\" by Kim/Xia Junsu the greatest male singer from Korea too bad Junsu's song is only for background music and Yoochun not sing any ost here it would be better if the male singer for after a long time has pass is Yoochun."], "837": [], "838": ["As of this review, I have seen 907 South Korean movies. This piece of garbage ranks safely among the bottom 20.A highschool guy changes his fashion sense and becomes more popular, but becomes a target by bullies. This movie feels like it was made for teenage girls who like to watch guys strut around, doing nothing interesting whatsoever. The humor is incompetent and the characters are wafer thin. The bully subplot is a dumb scriptwriting decision that clashes horribly with the rest of the movie; it feels like a desperate attempt to add fake depth. The fashion elements are embarrassing and not the least bit engaging. This is so devoid of content that it quickly becomes annoying, and it's frankly almost impossible to sit through.South Korea, along with Japan, has developed an outstanding pedigree for films concerning teenagers and/or children. Just in the past handful of years they have delivered A Brand New Life (2009), Thread of Lies (2014), Bleak Night (2010), Han Gong-ju (2014), Duresori: The Voice of East (2012), Silenced (2011), Pluto (2012), and Sunny (2011) \u2013 just to name a few. They have also made some fairly recent teenage comedies that were really good. I have greatly enjoyed some of their more light-hearted films.With that said, Fashion King (2014) is a pile of elephant manure. There's zero charm, zero laughs, and the serious elements are offensively bad.", "I am posting a review for this film, both because it was a lot of fun to watch and because I don't think it deserves to be represented solely by a one star review. I, myself, have only seen around 400 Korean movies but could easily name 20 of them that are MUCH worse than this one. I am assuming that the previous reviewer was objecting more to the style and content of the movie rather than the quality. Why namedrop heavy critically acclaimed dramas in a review for a lighthearted teen comedy about high school fashion. Because that is what this movie is. And that is all it is trying to be. It's obviously not shooting for a Grand Bell.The movie follows sad-sack nerd Woo Ki-myung who is so badly bullied that his mother moves him to Seoul to get away from his daily torment. Entering a high school where fashion is highly important, Ki-myung (with the help of an outrageous best friend and an underground fashion designer who is selling knock-off brand names on the web) reinvents himself as one of the trendy kids and is successful enough to come under fire from the school's fashion king. Their conflict, while moving the story forward, is not the heart of the movie as this is really a film about what makes a person truly stand out from the crowd. Do the clothes make the man or the man make the clothes.This movie has some very familiar teen tropes--nerd becomes cool becomes nerd, ugly duckling smart girl becomes beautiful swan, etc. But this film presents them in a fun, kinetic and unique way so they don't seem tired or re-tread. Won Joo is quite good as the tormented teen who still has a quiet self assurance about him, even as he is being humiliated. Seong-oh Kim is fantastic as the hungry fashion designer turned mentor. I quite enjoyed this film and found it, not only funny, but charming. It doesn't take itself too seriously and is intentionally goofy at times but that only adds to the fun of it. Plus, I hear all the dope kids like it.", "Why watch this film? For the actors, I guess. Or, if you are not in a mood for something too heavy. Though this one does get a little boring. Another problem was that the film focuses on representing the webtoon dynamics, trying to present that manga feeling as good as possible, which, unfortunately, results to make the film look cheep and kind of a TV movie. The story is not that bad, as the characters are interesting, but everything that happens is comical, odd and idiotic.

It's the story of a young man and a young girl who fall in love as children at age 8, attend the same schools through college, yet they never can seem to connect romantically and actually say \"I love you\" to one another. When he sees the girl he has loved his whole life getting ready to marry another man he is distraught and is visited by a male angel who gives him an elixir to go back in time and change his mistakes with the girl which led her to seek solace in someone else.Even after multiple chances to fix his mistakes he still makes more of them!

It's basically a musically themed melodrama about some young people.SPOILERS AHEAD!The story centers on the prestigious Kirin Arts Academy; a school devoted entirely to taking young talented performers and turning them into future star musicians, dancers, singers, etc. It's not easy getting into this school, but if you do, you'll be trained night and day to realize your potential.Enter our young aspiring artists. They come from differing backgrounds with varying experience and talents. They all try out to be accepted by the school; some make the cut and some don't for various reasons. One girl that fails to get accepted is given a chance to earn a special exception if she can bring in a couple of other students one of the teachers wants to train. Everybody soon converges together, and the story quickly focuses on the 6 young primary characters; 3 girls and 3 boys, some of which have made the cut, and some of which are trying to get in through the back door.The characters are forced to get to know each other, and have to work together to accomplish their goals (or work against each other as is sometimes the case). Some grow in life over time as individuals, others fall prey to the emotional pitfalls of success and failure. Along the way, some friendships are born and others are crushed, romantic interests are explored, and so forth. This is all very typical stuff for this type of genre, and, it's done competently enough to be a solid melodrama all on its own. All this is set against the backdrop of their individual talents & the arts school though, and, that is where the show really shines.Prior to watching this show, I already was aware that the 6 lead characters were actually fairly accomplished young musicians, dancers, and/or singers, in real life. There's a number of musical set pieces and performances throughout the show, and the 6 leads had no problem delivering the goods in that aspect when called upon. Actually, I was much more concerned if these people could really act, than I was worried they'd be able to pull off the musical numbers. Amazingly, they're all more than acceptable actors and actresses in their specific roles, and some of them gave quite good performances in regards. Overall: Fantastic Job Everyone!I wouldn't actually classify this show as a musical; there are only but a few song & dance numbers (if that many) that spontaneously break out. Almost all of the musical performances are done within the context of story (i.e. during practice, stage events, try-outs, scheduled performances, etc). There's also only a handful of instances of one of the cast members singing to another one, but that's about it. The way the musical performances are incorporated makes for real nice blend to the overall story. Neither part of these differing show aspects interferes with, or outweighs, the other; this is an important part in making this show work successfully as a whole, and, it was all handled with a good deal of aplomb throughout.There's a number of other secondary characters and story lines during this show's 16 episode run. Other artists come and go as guest stars, the school and teachers are focused on some, people's lives and families are looked at, etc. It's mostly all serviceably to effectively accomplished.What could be improved here?...not much (if anything). Asking to tone down the melodrama a bit is just not going to happen with these KTV shows, so deal with it. I suppose the production company could spring for some space heaters for everybody on the set of a winter time KTV show in order to keep their young stars from freezing to death.Bottom Line: This show is definitely geared towards a younger audience than I, but that didn't stop me from liking it anyway, and, I liked it a lot actually. It's enjoyable, and, it is quite good overall. The cast and crew of Dream High II has certainly got their work cut out for them if they want to be on par with this show.8 out of 10 stars!...Well Recommended!", "I loved this K-drama about high school kids pursuing their artistic dreams, and I'm a 55 year old woman! The soundtrack was awesome, and toe tapping, good for dancing! I even bought the CD on Amazon. Dream High was on Streaming Netflix but for some unknown reason they recently removed it. I am so glad I got to enjoy it before it was taken off! You can still see it on the DramaFever website but it's not as much fun when watching on a computer instead of a 60 inch HDTV - plus unless you pay monthly on that site to take the ads off you are interrupted with them on DramaFever every ten minutes. Annoying!I particularly enjoyed the story of the fat girl who lost weight in order to be taken seriously by her peers. Her transformation was beautiful.The boy I liked the best ended up winning the girl in the end, but that was hard because the other boy was very nice too. I felt sorry for his character, he was obviously still in love with her.Apparently there is a Dream High 2 sequel but none of the same cast returned so I will not be bothering with that one. I am not sure why they bother doing that -- bring back the same cast whom people felt close to the first time around.", "I'm not good in writing reviews, but this dorama was brilliant so I decided to write something about it.First of all - the plot is good, the casting is BRILLIANT - all the characters fit their roles for 100%, the music is very-very good, performance, makeup and costumes are good too. Thus all this in a bunch makes this dorama really exciting. Honestly, I see this 'sitcom'- dorama as the best in the line of all the musical series, I've seen in my life (I'm nearly 41, thus I have some experience in it :)) THE STORY: It's a story about 6 students of Kirin High School of Art in Seul - the school for pop talents - dancers, singers, composers. It starts from showing a girl (Go Hye Mi) singing opera on a stage. Next, we see shy girl (Yoon Baek Hee), acting like a Hye Mi's fan. She's Hye Mi's admirer and friend. Later it appears, Hye Mi's father went bankrupt and run away of the country, owing some money to mafia. Mafia tries to get the money from Hye Mi and this brings her from the way of opera singer to the Kirin school. Next we see Hye Mi's teachers (Kang Oh Hyuk, Shi Kyung Jin). Also we see future Hye Mi's friends - violent Jin Gook, country man Song Sam Dong, cool dancer Jason and strange person in a sushi costume (Kim Pil Sook). Hye Mi and Baek Hee will try to pass the entrance exams to Kirin school. Hye Mi will fail, but the school principal will open a special class for the students (and a teacher), who, by his opinion, worth something. Thus it is just the beginning of the story.Try to get it and see by your own eyes :)", "\"Dream High\" is a captivating musical drama that focused a group of young students of Kirin High School and their passionate journey through music to fulfill their dreams overcoming all the haphazard of life under the guidance of some motivating teachers. And the drama was simply moving and touching in many senses with fantastic music score. Some plot holes can be overlooked being mesmerized by the realistic plot line and natural acting. From the third episode, I really got into the drama and it was overall so interesting and heart-warming. Tough but emotional character Go-Hye Mi (the then newbie actress Suzy Bae quietly succeeded in turning out the main character, she's an awesome singer too), her follower friend Yoon Baek Hee, fatty but cutely Kim Pil Suk (IU) (both of their transformation are quite interesting),helpful and caring guy Jin Guk (Taecyeon was so lovely and matured in that role), music prodigy country boy Song Sam Dong ( cool alien Do Min Joon of \"My Love from the Star\" was a way too crazy!), , handsome Jason, inspirational guide - teacher Kang and also the other supporting characters were touching at least for some moments . At some times, the plot seems to get too melodramatic but I enjoyed the drama till the special concert whole-heartedly. It was an attractive display of modern Korean music and dance too. \"Nan kkumi issoyo. Khu kkum-eul midoyo\" ( I have a dream. I believe in that dream)- then hard effort is imperative to fulfill any great dream. We can be in ease in handling difficult situations just by smiling at fears. A good teacher is like a light house. In ups and downs of life, family and friend support can turn out to be a great relief. And after taking a decision, don't regret over it, you've a chance to prove it the best!- these inner morals of this drama are easy to say, tough to implement in real life but obviously these have made the drama ultimately inspirational , moving and memorable . Just to mention, I watched the impressive first season only and don't have any wish to watch the second season with totally different cast. :)", "I am not used to watch Asian dramas, I'm from Brazil and all I'm used are the TV shows from my country and some from Europe and the USA.But I got curious to check a little more about a foreign country from the other side of the world.When I first read some thoughts about this show I was expecting a story about six teenagers going into some trouble to get into an art school. But it goes far far away from that, in the very beginning I got a little upset about how things were taking place...But in the middle things started to be clearer and I can say for sure it is not only about six young dreams coming true, but it is the path they follow with the help of their family, friends and teachers.Yes, for me, the main plot of this TV show were the teachers, the students starts to follow what they believe and things happens not as we like in the middle, but as soon as it gets to the end you start to realize the values involved in everything.I am fascinated about what I just watched, I never wrote a review before because nothing has really touched me like I felt right now when I saw the ending.It is millions of time worth it to watch, you will see some of the Korean society cultures involved, you'll see some dreams coming true, others getting lost in their way, and most important, you'll see people rebuilding their path because they believe it is possible to dream and pursuit the happiness thru the realization of their dream.And I have to confess, everything is sooooo different from what I was used to, like if I'm not wrong, you'll see only four kisses, a very nice ones, very subtle and very beautiful... and you'll see a lot of crying and tears (like those I have right now)... and this is something I don't understand, why so many tears? This is something I don't see in dramas around here, but it might has a strong meaning for Koreans, because it is probably in every single episode.Once again, if you want to get touched, if you want to understand values of life, and of course, if you love music, you have to watch this, I promise, if you're a human being, it will touch you somehow.Enjoy and my best wishes for those who made this drama available."], "859": ["I avoided this drama for a while because I'm just not that into idols or boy bands but I was wrong, wrong, wrong.

Each member of the band had distinct and consistent interactions with each other band member, and each had a complicated personality and history with a compelling story and real growth. The band as a whole goes through its own story arc which is deeply satisfying. The side characters were well fleshed-out as well, and went on their own personal journeys. The writing, directing and editing were spot on. This is just a solid drama, inside and out. A must see.

The show dared to ask is a jolt of fame enough and what's next. What I liked about this drama: a) Intriguing band members that evolved throughout the series. First, initial leader Joo Byung-hee was compelling, a true free-spirit that swept the others into his dream band, Eye Candy. Second, the next leader and lead singer Kwon Ji-hyuk, with his laser beam eyes and desire to honor his friend's dream didn't make the right choices every time but his passion for his band family drove this show. Third, lead guitar Lee Hyun-soo smoldered with desire for success tempered by loyalty to his family (blood or friends). Fourth, drummer Jang Do-il was quiet and kind with gorgeous hair anyone would want. Fifth, bass guitar Kim Ha-jin loved women and tended to speak without thought but was centered in caring about his band of brothers. His old-married-couple friendship with the keyboardist was too cute. Sixth, keyboardist Seo Kyung-jong was the sweetest and willing to intercede to simmer the others down. b) Heroine Im Soo-ah was independent, with a quiet spunk and was not a doormat once she fell in love.c) Rich storyline. This story wasn't only a band trying to find fame and beat their rivals; it was about friends honoring a friend, a band dealing with the music business' machine, and their exploration of their individual needs while being loyal to each other. Where each member ends up at the end of the series seemed right. d) Downloadable music. The two primary songs, Jaywalker and Wake Up (my favorite), were catchy. Not as many Eye Candy songs as I expected. What I didn't like about this drama: a) Long time groupie Bang Woo-kyung, irritated me throughout the series. b) Bassist Park Pyo-joo for the rival band, Strawberry Field, was a bully that never learned a darn thing.", "Surprisingly, even though the summary of this drama doesn't do it justice, this drama was actually quite good.

After tragedy strikes, with their leader and best friend dying in a car accident, the boys take his last song, that he had written inspired by a girl in the new school, whom he calls his muse, and they participate in a music competition. Through that, they get an entertainment company's attention. Okay, I know the story doesn't sound as something amazing, but in general it is very good. Actually, the only thing that bothered me about this drama was the way it was filmed. The camera was unsteady and the shots and angles were messed up, as you could see a character staring to the front and at the next shot looking at the person next to him.

I am dying to get back to Korea and see the people, experience the amazing cuisine of many small dishes of various fish, vegetables, rice, and visit the temples.By studying this series, one can gain some good understanding into the Confucius thought that Korea adopted as its \"religion\" for hundreds of years, and gain some good insight into the people today.", "it is an inspired mixture between grace of fairy tale and force of cultural message. a seductive love story and remember of values, naive and profound. the feelings and the power. the sacrifice and the force of emotion. the past as veil and the pressure of duty. the meetings and the transformation of universe. at first sigh,nothing new. the Korean movies are masters of this kind of magic. but something seems be different. maybe,the subtle details, the precise performance of the young actors,the tension circles and the carefully made of the end. a film who can be more than a show. who is not exactly memorable. but it has the art to be, like a small river, good occasion to rediscover the beauty behind the reality of every day. and that fact represents, not doubt, a precious virtue.", "I overheard a student where i work mentioning that all her friends were asking for more Korean program suggestions on Netflix and I was intrigued. I've already enjoyed a few subtitled shows and when I heard her discussing them I knew I had to see for myself. While one of the suggestions wasn't really my cup of tea, Moon Embracing the Sun is one of those series you can only hope you find another like it. I'm on Episode 13 of 20 of Moon Embracing the Sun and it is one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had on television in years. It's a Korean period piece set in the distant past with a little bit of everything. The drama and romance (not sex) between the main characters is so intense. I love looking at their faces, their clothes, everything they do and the places they go. I find myself staring at the screen. It's a story about lovers who are subject to the events around them living in the royal palace and city. There's some political intrigue. There's the shaman culture and Confucian philosophy. There is a point where without warning the characters are replaced by older actors in a passage of time so I was a little confused at first but soon caught up.

The flawless acting helped in this case as well, though the leading lady was kind of emotionless at some points.

The show revolves around the inner workings of pharmaceutical conglomerate and the people working within it.SPOILERS AHEAD!This show has all your usual story lines that come with these melodramas, but, it gets off to a bit of an unusually odd and lighthearted start. A good portion of the first half dozen episodes or so are handled with a good bit of comedic touch, sometimes hysterically so. It seems to almost border on being more of a parody at times, and I really was digging the fact this show was perfectly willing to not to take itself too seriously. From the off the wall show trailers & previews, to the theme music utilized, to the crazy homage's to other films & shows that seemingly come out of nowhere. It all makes for quite an amusing intro. Your basic story finds our young hero, played by Lee Boem-Soo (\"Lifting King Kong\", \"Over My Dead Body\"), doing whatever he needs to raise money to provide for his sickly mother. He plays the earnest everyman who volunteers to enter an anti-aging clinical drug trial program as a test subject in order to earn some quick cash. He soon gets swept up in series of schemes presented to him that eventually leads to him work for the company that produces the drug he's the guinea pig for. While there, he meets the female lead; the outrageously obnoxious & bitchy granddaughter of the company president, played by Jung Ryeo-Won (\"Castaway on the Moon\"). She's terrific as the entitled, high maintenance, heiress who curses like a drunken sailor and leaves a trail of chaos in her wake with anyone and anything she encounters.Our two main leads, who are polar opposites, get thrown together as a result of various circumstances. They bond, and she comes to have more respect & understanding for how things work in the real world.Your other two young leads are played by Hong Soo-Hyun and Jung Gyu-Woon. The former is the lead research scientist turned secretary for the company, and, she is your resident gorgeous babe on the show; if scientists actually looked like her in real life, I would have majored in the subject. The latter is your obligatory KTV hunk that plays the up and coming corporate ladder climber with a hidden agenda. Both of them do a nice job in their roles, and together, they provide for a good bit of the comedic undertone that runs throughout the show.These 4 young protagonists are brought together time and again under various personal and business relationships. From there, it's just a matter of time to see who will be with whom, what happens to the company, who's \"good\" and who's not, etc. In the meantime, the rest of the cast is busy plotting, undermining, and backstabbing each other via increasingly preposterous means.Everything is moving along swimmingly from the start, then, this show slowly & surely starts to move away from what made it pretty enjoyable to begin with. What started off as a unique and interesting balance between humor and drama, soon became nothing more than a standard heavy dose of KTV melodrama fare! Eventually, the melodramatic back & forth stories become more and more ludicrous as the series progresses until it all just about spins out of control. It's a shame really!This show is not awful, and there are several things to like here, but I can't help but think this was a wasted opportunity to be so much more than it was. I feel it would have been far better served if it stuck to its somewhat clever initial tone throughout the entire series. Bottom Line: 6 out of 10 stars! Not without merits, and I liked a bunch of its parts, but the sum of its parts is lacking overall IMO. Ultimately, it just falls in step with so many other familiar premises that I've seen over and over again in this genre, and, it doesn't do this all that well either. Also, the BIG FINALE was as an absurd and anti climatic an ending as I've ever seen.Watchable, but, feel free to skip it if you have other stuff to check out on the horizon that you feel is more promising."], "868": [], "869": [], "870": [], "871": [], "872": [], "873": [], "874": [], "875": [], "876": [], "877": ["Absolutely no chemistry between the 2 main characters.

I am not a Korean nor do I know anything much about Korean history, but I could relate with the movie. The premise of the movie may seem a bit strange for modern viewers, but that was the sad truth: There were times in not so distant past when people were divided into strict social hierarchy; and it was a taboo to break those social norms. This movie is a simple triangular love story that forms between an aristocrat, his male servant, and an woman from aristocratic background that they both vie for. The cinematography is lush and full of colors, and the pacing of the film is slow without being boring. All three major actors played their part extremely well. Kim Ju-Hyuk as the hapless servant caught between his love and his duty towards his master is subtle and subdued in his performance. He dominates all the scenes that he is in. Yeo-Jeong Jo manages to expresses all the love, lust, and fierceness that a woman in her position can feel. And lastly Ryu Seung-bum as the vain but effeminate lord manages to catch the psychology of the character so well that I couldn't help but sympathize with him. Despite his cruel motive to destroy the two lovers, we do understand him not to be a demon; but just a regular guy who needs a hug. Don't be fooled by the love scenes. They are organically stitched to the overall movie, so it does not feel like it has been misplaced simply for the sake of titillation. Overall, this movie is a great viewing!!", "Last year I was incredibly fortunate to see this adorable movie when it premiered at The Korean Film Festival in Auckland. It was showing at The Academy, which is an informal art-house cinema in the basement of The Public Library. I was the only non-Asian person there too. For a \"Frock Movie\" fan like myself this was the most wonderful experience. The lush locations, hyper-color cinematography, the superb costumes and beautiful set dressing alone, make it a must-see. The surprising thing about the story, is that it is a comedy. I might not have realised this watching it with just English sub titles. The audience at the festival were laughing a lot. It appears it is a spoof of a traditional story which everyone knows. The script is very tongue in cheek and a bit anarchic. Think 'Blackadder\" view of historical events as a comparison. I wish this genre of films were more easily viewed. I am back in Cornwall now and there is no way I would have seen it here.", "Like folktales that goes through the eyes from a different perspective like the \"Three Little Pigs\" taken from the Big Bad Wolf's perceptive and the same going for \"Little Red Riding Hood\". This one takes a Korean folktale and tells the story from Bang-Ja's perspective while the high ranking guy is the evil one. And while Bang-Ja is in love with Lady Chun Hyang the high ranking guy who in the original folktale is like the charming prince just thinks of her as a piece of meat. And this story which is a twisted retelling of the folktale goes in a more depressing and tragic direction. While making this story out to be the true tale of what happened. Where none of the characters are likable and isn't a tale for younger audiences. Most of the way through the movie shows Bang-Ja in love with Lady Chun Hyang. So in order to win her because he is just a lowly servant, gets training how to sexually flirt with girls from Old man Ma who has a reputation for sleeping with many women using certain techniques to attract them. It probably won't work this day and age but it might have worked back then. But it was intriguing and kinda funny to see Old man Ma show the guy the ropes. And I think these types of scenarios made this movie a hit in Korea. While showing the realistic portrayal of thing, even if it isn't moralistically right. The ending seems a bit slightly forced into to show how the original folktale came to be but it's passable. This isn't a romance flick but a erotic love story I guess. Overall this movie is alright it's not a moving flick or a feel good one, in fact it's a depressing one that has somewhat realistic but negative message at the end. Men are known for falling for a girl over their beauty over personality and that really shows in this one I guess cause there really isn't anything likable about Chun-Hyang.6.8/10"], "896": ["Flower Boy Ramen Shop is a delightful mix of comedy and romance with an ensemble cast that gelled throughout the series.

There is excellent chemistry with the female lead Lee Chung- ah as Yang Eun-bi, they sizzle on screen. The second male lead, Lee Ki- woo as Choi Kang-hyuk, is a mature counterpoint and provides a true alternative for the female.

Yang Eun-bi's fear of the 6 year age gap, her desire to avoid another tempestuous relationship, and her initial limited trust in Cha Chi-soo are hurdles she sorts out during the series. The last episode is particularly satisfying, a rare occurrence in kdramas.

Okay, there were some cute moments, but the romance simply drugged too long. It actually finally concluded in the very last episode, after a big cheesy twist that could have been a The Heirs rip off. The girl kind of looked too young for her role, but she was funny and good enough with her acting. The two guys were okay, though the supporting roles were better and more interesting.

It is about the King of Joseon (Korea) who invented their alphabet as a simple way for his people to learn to read. Before that, they used the Chinese writing system so only the noble class could learn as there are thousands of letters and poor people never had the time. I have no idea if any of it is based on a true story...The focus is that there are numerous groups who are trying to stop the king publishing the new letters and they will go to any length to achieve their goals. Hidden Root is a secret organization who make stopping the new letters their priority and the king has to defeat them to succeed in publishing his new writing system.The star of the show is a slave whose parents were killed by the king when he was a small boy and he starts off trying to get his revenge by killing the king until he learns about the project to help the people.It's slow to get going. You need to watch 4 episodes to get into it but after that, it's got plenty of action including great martial arts / fight scenes.

I recommend this for fans of historical dramas and Martians arts etc. I doubt there is much universal appeal here. If you don't like historical stuff and have no patience for subtitles, this isn't the show to change your mind (probably). I watched it on drama fever and the translation is very poor.

However, it is Joo Jin Mo who steals the show in every scene with his strong delivery and intense eyes. Other noticeable performances came from Jeon Kuk-Hwan (El Temur), Jin Yi-Han (Tal Tal) and Baek Jin-Hee (Danashiri). The first 40 episodes were fast paced, dramatic and humorous with great action sequence. But the last 11 episodes were rushed, low budget, illogical and laughable, but I still give this show a 9 out of 10 because of the earlier episodes. The worst part of this show comes from the last four episodes where every major character dies one cruel and unnecessary death from another. Was it really necessary to kill off Maha, Yon Feisu and Wang Yu in such ridiculous manner? And why would Kolta and the Empress Dowager betray the Emperor Togon? And yet, the worst part was when Emperor Togon becomes an alcoholic and loses his mind and has hallucinations and his judgment becomes greatly impaired. The show is still worth watching because of the acting, however, the actors deserved a better script in the end. Maybe the show would have been better off if they ended it with 40 episodes.

I'm already looking for a new Yuan and Koryo era shows. The first episodes had a lighter theme, with brave characters fighting for the good of people, and even though there were deaths and betrayals involved it wasn't heavy on the heart. Later the show gets darker, with much more intrigues, and I must admit that they might have gone too far with that. The scenery, the costumes, the cinematography were breathtaking. The instrumental music was fitting, even though for some reasons they used calming music in battle scenes. The acting was brilliant. Joo Jin Mo (Wang Yoo) stole my heart so much that I will never get over all the sadness he felt after losing the love of his life. He did an excellent portrayal of an unhappy but dignified brave man. I liked the scenes with the first Empress and Sung Nyang, and the little tricks they played on each other were funny to watch. I give it a 9/10 because there were some plot holes, and a few silly scenes, but my overall impression is that it is worth watching. Also, the two ending scenes (one with Sung Nyang and the Emperor at the palace, and the final one with the trio at the beach) were heartbreaking, even though I was hoping for a happy ending.

Running through most of the 51 episodes is a question of who she actually loves, is it the King of Korea or the Emperor of Yuan. The series leaves it open to interpretation and many people continue to debate giving their reasons by what they have viewed and what it means to them.

The acting of the characters was brilliant throughout. Everyone from bang and jombak and YomFeisu make you cry. There was too much tragedy in the end. I could never get over the fact that wang yu had to lose maha and eventually himself but the emperor gets to live happily with nyang. The relationship between them was nothing compared to that of yu and nyang. Nyang may have been a huge support for the emperor but nobody loved and protected nyang like wamg yu. I have honestly no idea why people ship the emperor with nyang. OK. Personal opinions aside. Some may find the final ten episodes as predictable or unnecessary. But I think it was important to highlight on the character development of both Bayan and Tal tal. And how eventually even the most patriotic of men can turn corrupt with power. There was one tiny problem though. I felt that the reason we love Nyang and Wangyu so much is because their idea is too romantic. They are too perfect and too white to exist in reality.

I have no idea if lawyers actually investigate cases line Min in South Korea, but he certainly does. When he visits the crime scenes he's able to smell or taste the blood and see in his mind how the murders occurred\u2014a bit like how Will is able to channel the murders on Hannibal. In addition to him, the team is also made up of three others\u2014the detective Hwang Soon-bum, rookie prosecutor Yoo Jung-in and an intern, Choi Dong- man. These folks are a nice addition and the ensemble cast reminds me so much of the Law & Order franchise\u2014as does the way the cases are investigated and prosecuted. And, the heavy use of forensics in the show is like seeing an installment of CSI.Now you'd THINK that the show might be a bit like Twilight or Dracula but it's really like neither.

Perhaps most unusual was a lack of love story subplots.If you liked Vampire Prosecutor and appreciated these elements, you'll like Vampire Prosecutor 2. Only six episodes have aired so far and we see *SPOILER* that a love story might brew up after all *END SPOILER* but I'm very much okay with that.

Cause maybe the first few minutes I started focusing on how horrible the camera man was. The scenes had too many close ups, it changed scenes like every five minutes, and the camera couldn't hold still. So I stopped watching it until I caught my friend watching it and so she told me to watch it instead since she was going to take a shower, (I couldn't find the remote to click it off) So I ended up watching it, only this time I focused more on the plot. By the end of episode 2, I was hooked. Deeply. The plot was very well made! The main character Min Tae Yeon, was very well made, as well were other characters' descriptions. Unfortunately, there were times when the acting was a bit of a cringe, but the well made plot made it disappeared. The main female lead... I didn't like her personality tbh. She was rude when it was unnecessary and she seemed really nosy in others businesses when she tells others not to get in her own. Her character was very smart, I'll give her that. Although, I thought she had a bit of a reason to behave the way she did, but that shouldn't mean to be rude when uncalled for. The 2nd male lead, his character was funny because he was a bit of a mess, but that has never stopped him. In fact, sometimes he used it to his advantage. He was actually trustworthy and very useful at times. And just to make him more human, he was a bit of a pervert. But more like a common guy liking women alot in that way. Sadly, he doesn't get anyone. The 3rd male lead is my second favorite next to the main character. Really, h e just a cowardly guy that is computer and forensics smart", "When I watch the casts' interview on TV promoting their drama, I was a little bit skeptical. I mean, really, how could I not?

Such a pitiful excuse.So, what started as let just watch this because I don't have anything else to watch turn into a binge-watching show time. I finish the 2 seasons in 2 days. What fair Vampire Prosecutor from other vampire storyline is that it is Asian-flavored. Instead of diving into a whole lot of historical existence, the story go its own way.Since every episode deal with a different case, the story managed to be different every time. They threw in dramatic-thriller, romance and comedy along the way.I have to conclude this with 7 because I want too see more romance or bromance. Also wish to see their acting gets better."], "906": [], "907": [], "908": [], "909": [], "910": [], "911": [], "912": [], "913": ["Little Girl K is a Korean TV series about a young female assassin that aired in 2011. It goes by so many different names that it's hard to keep track of (it's aka \"Girl K\", \"Killer K\", \"Sonyeo K\"). It's worth checking out if you're into this sort of thing.SPOILERS AHEAD!This show is similarly themed to \"Le Femme Nikita\", \"Leon the Professional\", etc. So, you basically know what you're getting here (i.e. young discarded girl trains to become a killer). There's nothing really new or groundbreaking involved, but it is executed & paced quite well, and is packed with lots of typical South Korean cinematic goodness.The lead character (Yeon Jin) is played by Han Groo. She is more than capable enough throughout the show in accomplishing what's asked of her (which is quite a lot actually). She plays a cute & likable, albeit tough, high school girl who lives alone with her single mother. She can't seem to stay out of trouble though, and one day she gets tossed into a series of events that culminate in her & her friends being sought after by some very bad people. Eventually, she gets tracked down by the bad guys and as result, her mother and many of her friends are killed, and she is left for dead.She miraculously survives the onslaught however, and is taken in by an older female assassin who nurses her back to life and then trains her as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Yeon Jin looks to her newfound mentor as somewhat of a surrogate mother that can provide her both guidance and direction in life, and with her back ground in martial arts and desire to seek vengeance, Yeon Jin eagerly & quickly absorbs all the killing knowledge & training she can from this woman.After recovering from her near death experience, and receiving her combat/assassin training, Yeon Jin sets out on the most difficult task imaginable; going back to high school as a new transfer student. I found this part of the show to be highly amusing; it's not meant to be funny per se, but the juxtaposition of the two opposite worlds she now inhabits and has to juggle is sufficiently entertaining. During the course of the school day, she reluctantly becomes more and more concerned with fitting in at school, making new girl friends, experiences angst over her feelings for a boy classmate that likes her, etc (i.e. typical high school girl stuff). And, at lunch, she's on the roof of a building with a high powered rifle trying to assassinate someone per her mentor's orders.Everything is moving along swimmingly to begin with, but Yeon Jin eventually discovers that her mentor is not quite who she appears to be and has ulterior motives that simply can't be abided. Even though Yeon Jin has long since become a cold hearted killer, she still knows right from wrong, and is soon pitted against her mentor and the \"evil organization\" she belongs to in a fight to death.This show is a little bit unusual in the way it continually tries to straddle the line from sometimes being a simple & cute high school girl drama, and then at the flick of a switch, suddenly devolves into a remorseless & seedy bloodbath. For what is essentially a \"made for TV\" Korean melodrama, this show is often INCREDIBLY VIOLENT; you'll find more violent stuff in various movies of course, but I can't recall any previously made Korean TV show that is as delightfully & frequently vicious as this show often is. The producers and director of this show obviously have no problem letting the blood flow here at will, and there's a fair amount of nudity as well if I recall correctly (but not from any of the lead characters). For a TV show that essentially revolves around the dramatic life of a high school girl, it's as \"down & dirty\" as can possibly be.Now, this show is only 3 episodes long, but I don't know why this is; I can't imagine this show was canceled in such a short time for lack of ratings, and the story seems to be purposely made to be completed at the end of the 3rd episode. Three episodes is very short and highly unusual for KTV, and I can't help but wonder why this wasn't just cut down to a 2 hour movie format, or wasn't fleshed out into a longer TV show. I'm not even sure if the short run time is actually a benefit or detriment to this show though; on the one hand, everything is tightly paced & compacted by the sheer nature of needing to get everything wrapped up within the 3 episodes. On the other hand, I enjoyed it quite a bit; so much so, that I would have most certainly watched some more episodes if there were any to be had. This show ultimately ended with a scene that left open the opportunity for some type of follow up show/series, or what have you, but I've not heard of anything that might indicate as much as of the writing of this review.As is the case with any action-drama TV show, \"Little Girl K\" can get a tad over the top and a slight bit corny at times, but it doesn't do so very often. And, with such a short run time, you can easily forgive & forget any such flaws you might find with it in contrast with the overall scheme of things.Bottom Line: I enjoyed this show, A LOT!...If you're looking for a quick fix to quench some blood thirst, and satisfy your need for Korean action melodrama, then this might be right up your alley. And if it turns out not to be your thing once it concludes, at least you didn't have to devote weeks upon weeks of your life watching it.8 out of 10 stars!", "Pretty good Korean version of La Femme Nikita. It has the same basic plot line. A girl is presumed dead and given a choice: Work for secret government agency as an assassin or you're dead anyway.It's a 3 part mini-series centered around the heroine Cha Yeon Jin seeking to avenge the murder of her mother by the hands of a religious fanatic.Her mother escapes with Cha Yeon Jin (an infant at the time) from a secret government facility with the help of the officer who ran it after he has an attack of conscious.After 15 years on the run she is found and kidnapped when her daughter witnesses a crime with her friends. The mother is killed in front of Cha Yeon Jin and she is gunned down and left for dead.The secret government agency nurses Cha Yeon Jin back to health and recruits her as an assassin. She agrees as long as she is allowed to go after the man who killed her mother.Lots of nudity and violence and just enough differences to make it a interesting show.If you don't mind reading subtitles it's worth a viewing."], "914": [], "915": [], "916": [], "917": [], "918": [], "919": ["Wonderful show!First,I was delighted by how we are given these characters and they proceed to evolve in the following 17 episodes-none of them stay locked in,they change,as people should.Basically this big company is run by Mrs. Song(Grandma),her son Chairman Cha,her daughter Sook-hee Shin, and the two sons Ji-heon Cha(Ji Sung) and Mu-won Cha(Jaejoong-\"Hero\").

Cha Ji-Hun - played by Ji Sung. This poor guy has so many phobias, you just feel sorry for him. His childlike ways should maybe be annoying but Ji Sung makes the character charming and adorable in his own way. You can't help but root for this guy!Cha Moo-Won - played by Kim Jae-Joong/Jaejoong. Cha Moo-Won is a very capable business man who seems to have everything together. Which is completely opposite from his cousin. Jaejoong also has charm but comes off like an adult.President Cha - played by Park Yeong-Gyu. President Cha is an overbearing, kind of abusive and strong willed Dad. He really loves his son, and is frustrated that he won't take things seriously. Not understanding that his son has issues that he has been deliberately hiding from his family.

The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back. This may recur in the same story.Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved.If personality dynamics are properly depicted in a valid manner, and if the production is skillful, powerful emotions can be evoked in the viewer. In this way we can live many lifetimes through movies, in our one lifetime - greatly enriching our incarnate experience.These South Korean productions (seen on Netflix streaming) are first class with excellent production and direction, some terrific casting and acting (particularly from some of the females who give some matchless world class performances), brilliant musical accompaniment, and staging. What makes these so good is the way they skillfully evoke deep emotion in the viewer. South Korean movie making is superb - world class.However, the following caveats must be considered by the USA viewer:They are subtitled and some people hate this. The South Korean cultural norms, values and sanctions may sometimes seems silly or old fashioned to the USA viewer. The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation/unity - sometimes reminiscence of a old Frank Capra film.Most importantly, in order for the sometimes complicated sub-plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing, and this leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people, that sometimes seem to be unlikely by USA cultural standards. The viewer may wonder at times why good but trusting people are so easily manipulated and deceived by bad and selfish people, but con artists do often succeed (just look at politicians for example). However this poetic license of improbability is needed to develop the story - just accept it as occurring even though unlikely at times. Taking these factors into account will help you become involved and emotionally engrossed. It was hard for me to quit watching at times so I often binged watched more than one episode at a time.I would rank these as follows but tastes differ and your rankings might not agree: 1 - 4 (hard to say which is best)Shining InheritanceWhen a Man LovesThat Winter, The Wind BlowsSecret garden5. Five Fingers6. The Scent of a Woman7. The Great Queen Seondeok8. A Hundred Years Inheritance9. Lie To me10. Roof Top Prince11. Dr. Jin12. The Great DoctorThe Scent of a Woman develops fully, sometimes at slow pace for some viewers, in unfolding its story. In the second half of this 16 episode series, the emotional fireworks set in. Some serious issues of love are dealt with in a valid manner. This series is perhaps more modern, organized, coherent, and plausible than others that are ranked above, which is a plus for some viewers.", "Lovely drama with some beautiful performances especially from the lead actress and the lady playing her mother. What a wonderful relationship. Sometimes it was loving, sometimes they got on each other's nerves.\nI love the fact of the toupee wearing tango teacher wasn't made a figure of fun, and that the toupee is never used for comedy purposes.\nThere were some lovely moments. My favourite was the dance on the beach with the elderly gentleman.\nThe last drama i watched was 49 days, which was very good too. but i think i preferred scent . because unlike 49, it had a good balance between great looking people, and others.\nThe ending was spot on"], "922": ["I've seen a couple of Korean' dramas. Maybe they are a bit cheesy sometimes or not so sophisticated but they have a kind of purity, a world than can be easily loved and not so sick, perverse than we experience often in these days living in the 'western part' of the planet and wathcing 'western' series.This Korean drama is a kind of Romeo and Juliet story and I apologise to say this but in this meaning the old Shakespeare drama is nowhere comparing to this - at least for me. Even Zefireli's movie is nowhere comparing to this (however it was a beautiful movie).Outstanding musics, professional performance of actors and actresses. They were just as good as the best of UK's. The performances - in my opinion - were as professional as it was in my other favourite, in Rome, where I had admired all of the actors and actresses, where even the smallest part was acted highly professionally.The most lovable, beautiful story I've seen in long-long years, spring in my heart, and a piece you must seen to appreciate and enjoy life, love, relationship, purity. It is like a nice, good smelled breeze, very light and cheerful at the beginning and very dark around the end - but nevertheless even the dark part will lift and fill your heart whit good feelings and teach something we should have not forgot - the power or love and good morals - to me: things which worth to live for.", "Best performance Noh Tae Yub as Danjong. The more I saw of this young actor, The more impressed I was by him. I would follow that up by the performances Lee Min Woo as Jung Jong and Hong Soo Hyun as Princess Kyung Hye I loved the developing relationship between these two, and it was one of my favourite parts of this drama. Predictable? probably. but still lovely to watch. Regarding Jung jong's character, I could see that he would have more steel, than you were supposed to think. My other favourite part of the drama was Moon Chae Won as Lee Se Ryung confrontation with Kim Young Chul as her father Prince Suyang (later King Sejo) This was me was surprising to see in a korean drama. Another first was the gay guy. I've seen gay characters in Thai Lakoprns. But I can't recall seeing an openly gay character in a K-drama before. I also liked the fact that Kim Roe-Ha as Jo Suk-Joo was a better fighter than the hero. I found the performance of the two leads ie the aforementioned Moon Chae Won, and Park Shi Hoo as Kim Seung Yoo to be fine. She was probably better than him. But I would say that Song Jong Ho as Shin Myun was better than Park Shi Hoo The ending. At first I had the wrong idea. So the king and his wife are going somewhere. The king spots somebody who looks like supposedly our hero Kim Seung Yoo. So seeing as the king looks so old, I thought the guy he spotted was Kim Seung Yoo's son. But now, it turns out it's actually him. Okay, that's fine, but he din't look that much older. Also The king aka the main villain is now portrayed at the end of the drama as a kindly old man. It#s like seeing Hitler turn into Santa Claus. But when watching the ending. I didn't think it was a bad one. For me it certainly wasn't a predictable ending, but for that ending the villain had his character completely changed. So the ending is good, in basically letting the villain get away with what he did. But bad in that it conveniently forgets what kind of character he was. My other niggle is the last time it decided to use Lee Se-Ryung as bait, Sin Myeon acts as if he hadn't done or thought about it himself earlier. Oveerall, a really terrific drama."], "923": [], "924": [], "925": ["Koreans make surprisingly good TV shows. If it wasn't for Drama fever and Netflix,, nobody in the US would ever know. For fans of Martial arts movies and ninja stuff, there are few options that come anywhere close to being as good as this show. It's a TV show, not a movie but it kinda watches like one long movie of 29 episodes of 1 hour each. The format gives the title something that is missing in almost all Ninja Movies. Ninja films are often criticized for being a little too light on story lines in favor of packing them full of action. Warrior Baek Dong Su takes the time to develop the characters and a very intricate but fascinating plot. Part of it is loosely based on a historical figure of the same name. The rest is made up to make it, well, good. It is still packed with action from the first episode, all the way through to an amazing finally. At a high level, 2 boys grow up together. One becomes the best swordsman in Korea (which makes them the best in the universe according to Koreans). The other, is secretly part of an organization of assassins called the black Ninjas. He grows up to become the best assassin in Korea (also universe). They kinda fall out when Baek Dong Su finds out about his friends job. The assassin goes on to get involved in a plot to overthrow the king while the main guy (Baek Dong Su), leads the effort to stop them. There are tons of great characters. Only Koreans have names like \"God of Swordsmanship\" and address each other like that. If you like Ninjas, you will love this. The rest of you will probably dismiss this show as weird foreign nonsense which is a shame. If you can get past that part, you will probably enjoy it too.", "Warrior Baek Dong Soo is a historical Kdrama of 2 friends that take divergent paths. The storyline is presented in 2 layers, the adult storyline between rivals, Master Swordsman and Black Ninja Leader, and the young adult storyline between two childhood friends, Baek Dong Soo (becomes apprentice to the Master Swordsman) and Yeo Woon (becomes apprentice to the Black Ninja Leader). There is a heavy dose of political intrigue coveting the throne of the current king and eliminating the contenders for the throne. What I liked about Warrior Baek Dong Soo: a) Adult storyline lead actors nailed it and drew me in immediately. The quiet and gentle Master Swordsman Gwang Taek versus the hard-drinking and hard-hearted Black Ninja Leader Chun was compelling throughout the entire series. b) Young adult storyline lead actors grew and eventually hooked me too. As the characters transitioned from child to adult, the power of their storyline increased. The friendship between Baek Dong Soo and Yeo Woon was real and betrayal at the divergent paths they took combined with yearning to eventually be friends again was palpable. c) Top notch fight scenes. Not every fight scene was excellent, but there was beautifully staged and directed fight scenes in this series. Baek Dong Soo's single sword and Yeo Woon's double swords flew many times in this series. Master Swordsman Gwang Taek's finesse and Black Ninja Leader Chun's direct fighting were striking.What I did not like about Warrior Baek Dong Soo: a) Villains get away with murder (again and again) and had the upper hand the majority of the series. The balance of power should shift between the good and evil forces during the series, not stay squarely in the villain's domain. It makes our heroes weaker and less effective. b) Character reversals in the final episode. This series is 29 episodes and there was some continuity in character behavior until the final episode where 2 characters were written so their actions created an intolerable situation for one of our leads. This was difficult to swallow and reduced my opinion of the overall drama. They should have ended the series at episode 28 and I would have been satisfied not disappointed. c) The final episode epilogue was too long. Most kdramas epilogues are the briefest glimpse into the future and I crave more. Here the epilogue went on and on and on.

It's workable, but there are some problems.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Mi-ri and Hee-joo arrive separately at an orphanage as children. They get to know each other, then Hee-joo is soon off to be adopted, but Mi-ri ends up being the one adopted instead by \"mistake\". A short time later, Hee-joo is also adopted by a different set of parents. Then, flash forward in time to when these two girls are now young women. Hee-joo got adopted by a great set of parents that enabled her to get a stellar education and basically lead a normal productive life. Mi-ri got adopted by some degenerates though, and she had to grow up under less than ideal circumstances. Mi-ri eventually escapes her crappy existence and reunites with Hee-joo by chance. The 2 young female leads soon get involved with two male hoteliers, and the story is off and running from there.Mi-ri is played by Lee Da-hae (the main focus of this series). She plays the woman who's determined to get by on hard work & persistence going forward in life, but she has little choice to fall back on her street smarts & looks just to survive. Her actions soon lead her down a path of continued \"success\" born of small lies at first, then bigger lies, then outright greed. Mi-ri is someone you'd like to see succeed because of the crappy hand in life she's been dealt, if only she would just cease devolving into more and more of a manipulative person that can't stop working every angle & person she can to get ahead.Kang Hye-Jung is the other female lead who's cast as Hee-joo. She's the cheerful & hard working girl who's poised to soon get her big break as an aspiring design artist, if she wasn't a complete klutz who can't ever seem to get out of her own way. She welcomes Mi-ri back into her adult life only to ultimately find that Mi-ri is really not a very nice person. Nevertheless, she does her best to help Mi-ri due to the past debt she feels she owes her (for the adoption mishap that occurred years ago), and, just because she's simply a warm hearted person. Hee-joo is easy to root for, but you do want to slap some sense into her for letting Mi-ri walk over her time and again. She clearly needs to stand up for herself and start taking charge of her own life.Kim Seung-woo plays male lead # 1 (Myung-hoon). Myung-hoon is a no nonsense hotel manager who's fresh off his divorce from his rotten ex wife when he rebounds into a relationship with Mi-ri. Considering his recent romantic experience, he should've seen through Mi-ri from a mile away, or been somewhat leery of her motives at the very least. I guess some men never learn though; he's all too willing to fall victim to the whims of another pretty face who offers a few kind words when he's vulnerable. You hope this dude will get it together before he gets in too deep with Mi-ri.Park Yoo-Chun plays male lead # 2 (Ta-ka). Ta-ka is the young heir to the hotel chain that's soon set to take over the hotel that Myung-hoo works for. He pretty much has it all, but he quickly falls for Mi-ri too. Once Mi-ri finds out who he really is, she sinks her teeth into him quick and hard, and, he's powerless to resist her charms. He should also know better to fall for Mi-ri (just like Myung-hoon) , but Ta-ka is a little young & dumb when it comes to true love, so I guess he can be given a pass in regards. However, he's also clearly an idiot for not realizing that he should be with Hee-joo instead; she likes him, and she's pretty and kind and honest, and the two of them would likely make for a great couple if only Ta-ka could get his head out of Mi-ri's ass long enough to realize this.Our four main leads are thrown together, and it's just a matter of time to see how far Mi-ri will go; will she make it to the top, will her lies destroy her and everyone around her, will she be able to make amends for all the trouble she's caused, etc?Story is pretty solid and moves along nicely for a good chunk of this 16 episode show, that is, until the pacing hits a wall past the midway point and the plot eventually starts spinning out of control! DAMN YOU K-dramas directors & writers!...when are you going to learn how to bring these shows to a better conclusion on a more regular (and less ludicrous) basis?...There are eventually back to back episodes of 2 separate characters suffering brain injuries, 2 characters find out they're blood related (which was a hinted at story line that I was praying wouldn't come to fruition as feared), etc. All this climactic nonsense & poor final planning hurts this show significantly, and I'm downgrading it some as a result (because I'm really getting tired of this crap).I did like a solid majority of this show though, and the 4 main leads got their jobs done quite well, which is a big help in the overall scheme of things; I've also really taken a liking to Lee Da-hae, in particular, over the years as an actress. I'm very much looking forward to see if she can pull off her lead role in the upcoming \"Iris\" sequel. We shall see!Bottom Line: this particular show is probably in the 6-7 star range.

This show aired in the summer of 2011, and it's not half bad.SPOILERS AHEAD!I see four other people have reviewed this series already (to some wildly ranging opinions). I watch these shows all the time, and have a pretty good handle on them, so perhaps I can be of some help in providing a more balanced review. Basically, this show is standard fare for the genre; it's neither ground breaking nor spectacular, but it is mostly watchable and worth checking out if you like this sort of thing. It's pretty decent overall.Here's your story: It's late 1980's or early 1990's, and North and South Korean tensions are mounting. A group of hardened South Korean marines are tasked with infiltrating the North to kill a number of prominent military leaders at the behest of 5 South cabinet members and high ranking officials. During the raid, the 5 South leaders who masterminded the plan reverse course for political reasons, but it's too late to stop the mission. As a result, they must now eliminate the team they sent north without a trace, and they must do so at all costs in order to preserve national security and peace between the 2 nations.The South Korean leaders appear to be successful in eliminating their own marines. One member of the team survives the onslaught however, thanks to his long time friend in the squad who saved his life. Obliged to fulfill the wishes of his dying friend, and fearing that his friend's entire family may also be killed, he absconds with his friend's newborn son and goes on the run. This surviving team member is upset (to say the least), and he's not a man to be trifled with. He disappears into the Golden Triangle where he raises his friend's son while he rises to power & wealth in the drug supply trade. All the while, he plots eventual revenge on the 5 leaders back in Korea who killed his comrades in the past, and, he plans on one day using his \"adopted\" son to help him accomplish this goal. As such, the adopted son is essentially groomed from birth to carry out this plan in the future.Flash forward to 2010 or so. The son he raised is now fully grown and inserted back into Korea. He's rich, well educated, good looking, and armed with all the training he needs to ruthlessly take revenge on the people who caused the death of his father. The 5 men he must dispatch have since risen to great power and are now well entrenched politically and financially, and one of them is now the South Korean President. Undaunted, father and adopted son set about their task to eliminate these evildoers one by one.Some problems arise though; the son is not the ruthlessly driven killer his adopted father is, and he starts to question and waiver on the task at hand over time. He also takes a liking to a pretty young girl along the way, who turns out to be an up and coming secret service agent in charge of protecting the president (i.e. the main target). Ahhhh!...this is a staple of KTV melodrama...everybody is somehow involved with somebody else, and all story lines & plot points intertwine & intersect with one another somehow. And every character is a rival to someone else; old against new, weak against powerful, good against evil, father against son, son against love interest, etc. How will this particular show play out these themes in the end?...Watch and see for yourself!There's a god bit to like about this show. It's often quite entertaining and fairly interesting, but it does get bogged down a little bit during its run time. It would have benefited from trimming its 20 show format down to about 12-16 episodes or so, but, I've been over this same ground too many times with other similar shows I've watched & reviewed; it's just the nature of airing KTV dramas, and, you're just going to have to get used to it if you endeavor to watch them.Bottom Line: I liked it for the most part, and it's certainly watchable. It is not deserving of its current lofty 8.4 rating, nor its two glowing 10 star ratings from the previous reviewers. But it's certainly not a 3 star rated pile of crap either. It's worth checking out if you have 20 hours to kill and are looking for a Korean style love story/melodrama fix with a decent enough amount of action & intrigue.7 out of 10 stars!", "I first heard about City Hunter well before it was to be aired. I had set it aside to watch, mainly because I'd recently become a fan of Lee Min Ho (main male lead) via his previous dramas. Unfortunately, it took me a whole year before I finally sat down and watched this truly amazing drama.I was captured from the very first episode, where you witness the deaths of 20 Korean soldiers, betrayed by their own country. The musical score used to draw you into that whole scene is just...beautiful, and heart- breaking. It plays throughout the series, perfectly placed, perfectly timed. I began to love each of the characters and watch them progress, some of them more than others. The relationship between Lee Yoon Sung and his father is one of the core aspects of the drama. I tell you now, if you have not seen this drama, go and watch it. You will not be disappointed. I felt that it got a solid ending that wrapped up all the loose ends in the plot, and even with the romance. It left me wanting more..in a good way XD I would totally go for a second season, if the original cast remained :pFrom the astounding musical cores, the lovable characters, and engaging plot, I highly recommend this drama.", "Although this show might have started off slow and boring for me by the end I was gripping on to my seat in nerve-wracking anticipation. The action was authentic and the characters completely lovable. I would like to have seen more romance between the lead couple but their chemistry either way was evident. The plot had a few loose ends and I hated the ending which left me feeling unfulfilled, but I'll forgive the makers on the grounds that I loved the series as a whole. I would definitely recommend watching this to anyone who loves the good looking hero with a hidden identity trying to save the world and protect his lady love, etc etc.", "I have always been a huge fan of movies or TV series such as Zorro, Superman, and The Scarlet Pimpernel. City Hunter has the same elements that I love in these other stories--a good looking man as the star, who has a secret identity and even wears a mask at times. He uses his wits to foil the bad guys and he is very skilled at fighting. He tries to help the innocent victims and ruin the evil guys without killing them.Usually, an episode ends on a cliffhanger, but with Netflix you don't have to wait to see what happens next.The first episode was not my most liked, but I stuck it out because the star, Lee Min Ho is my favorite Korean actor. I love everything he has been in that I have seen so far.This Korean drama is the one I prefer most, now that I have seen at least 23 entire dramas. They typically are 16-24--sometimes more--episodes each. Each episode is usually just over an hour, with no commercials (on Netflix). Each series is a complete story that ends when it is complete. I also like that it isn't R rated. I would definitely say it was PG 13. Not sure what the standards are in South Korea for rating shows.The only complaint I have is that you have to be a fast reader to read the subtitles before they disappear. I think the English subtitles are transcribed by volunteers and you occasionally see grammar mistakes, but it is still worth it to see this show.", "City Hunter had focused, intricate episodes with many surprises in the series. This series was billed as a prequel to the Japanese City Hunter manga series written and illustrated by Tsukasa Hojo.City Hunter was a tale of revenge with key bromances as the linchpins for the series: Dad (Lee Jin-pyo) and City Hunter (Lee Min-ho), City Hunter and Prosecutor (Kim Young-joo), City Hunter and the sidekick (Bae Shik-joong). City Hunter stalked, trapped, and turned over men that had done Dad wrong many years ago. The revenge was satisfying for targets 1- 3, but the death of target 4 was too long in coming and didn't seem enough after brutal death of the prosecutor, the impeachment of the President seemed like a slap on the wrist, his term was almost up.The romance between City Hunter and Kim Na Na built steadily then was iced by the City Hunter so he could focus on the final targets and revenge. This left the City Hunter alone and the story weaker by him not relying on Kim Na Na and Bae Shik-joong his sidekick (both characters were effectively neutered for the remainder of the series).City Hunter had well written episodes that completely hooked me but the pacing, the writing and wrap-up decisions of last 2 episodes bothered me and downgraded my overall feelings of the series to \"missed it by that much\" (very good but not great). The series wrapped with a whimper not a bang. The epilogue scenes were ambiguous and left me saying - that's it? Problems with the final two episodes: 1. The final target, the President, was weak and anti-climactic. All the other targets had done dastardly things for greed and power. The Presidents' misdeeds did not have any impact. The President was neither villain nor hero, but rather blah and non-descript. If a villain isn't compelling it drags the story down. The story the President told of stealing lunch money and not being able to admit the wrong doing when confronted, seemed to repeat itself. 2. The reveal that the President was City Hunter's biological father was a non-event. This should have strongly rippled and impacted the characters \u2013 but no, it didn't. 3. Having target #4 (Chun Jae-man) escape (who was the inside man that did that?) after City Hunter delivered him to the Prosecutor Kim Young- joo was annoying. Revenge on target #4 took too long and consumed too much of the series energy. 4. Killing the prosecutor Kim Young-joo was unnecessary and harsh. It seemed to leave a shell-shocked pall on all the characters in the finale episode. The out-side-the-law City Hunter needs his sworn-to- uphold- the-law counterpart Prosecutor (e.g. Batman and Commissioner Gordon). 5. The epilogue was short and ambiguous, leaving a negative last impression of the series. Why did the mother and Bae Shik-joong move to America? Did City Hunter and Kim Na Na get together? Throughout the series City Hunter stated he wanted to be able to achieve a normal life after the revenge was complete \u2013 did he? The City Hunter said that he'd come back to Kim Na Na and Kim Na Na said she'd wait for him. Did City Hunter continue as a vigilante with Kim Na Na waiting at home with dinner for him? If so, was his father's sacrifice,declaring himself City Hunter, wasted?", "I think City Hunter is the best drama in the Korea.Because there are very talented actor in this drama.Lee Min Ho is successful and handsome actor.So I want to watch always Lee Min Ho's series.First;you will see action in this series.After you will see mysterious and romantic parts.But after than you will see lies,treachery,slander.Suddenly finally you will see blue and separation.But also surprises in this series.When I didn't bored,I was watching City Hunter.\u0130f you watch the City Hunter you won't weary and also you never guess what will be in the finally and you be surprised.So I love City Hunter.if you want to watch City Hunter I will suggest you.", "In term of the look and age of Lee, this drama shows the best of him. Young, smart and handsome. With tbe female lead, they also create chemistry.\nThe storyline of the first half is intricated yet logical. Towards the end, unfortunately, the story become a bit loose. Or it will be a really classic action and romance drama.", "This was one of my favorite K dramas. I can say there was only maybe 1/2 of an episode where I felt it was dragging but I thoroughly enjoyed every episode. Most K dramas have plots that are not realistic or complicated love stories where either the man or woman refuses to admit their love. I liked that this drama had a love story that was realistic. I liked how they both were up front about their feelings but due to a psychotic dad, they couldn't be together which I found refreshing and realistic.I loved all the action scenes and although some people might have been disappointed about the ending, I loved it. I thought it was very realistic.", "*SPOILERS AHEAD*I was in two minds on whether to watch City Hunter or not, so I decided that I would take a call after seeing the first episode. 30 minutes into the first episode and I already had goosebumps. I just completed watching the entire series and I cannot not review it.City Hunter definitely is a very good show. The revenge plot is so extremely justified that as a viewer you actually squeal when the culprits are taken down one by one. But the fact is it does leave you wanting for more, it gives you the feeling that the end could have been better, and that is exactly why it doesn't become outstanding! Then again that doesn't mean its ending was bad. Yoon Sung knew his father loved him, yet there were times he doubted it. In the end though, that father, whom he thought did not love him after all, did make his last attempt to save his son.The scene when Lee Jin Pyo falls on the ground after being shot and holds Yoon sung's hand..They had their differences, they had their own ways of taking revenge, but the fact remains that they succeeded because they both worked on it together.The relationship between a father and a son who are not even blood related was depicted in an absolutely intriguing manner- They couldn't stay with each other nor without. For me, Lee Jin Pyo will always be Yoon Sung's real father. Whatever be his motive, Yoon Sung was precious to him.It would have been so much better had Kim Young Joo been there till the end. His last words were that of Prosecutor Young jo and not Young Jo. For some one who devoted his entire life for the justice of the country, such a brutal death was heart breaking. He should have had at least unsolved the mystery of operation clean sweep before dying.Kim Na Na seemed like more of a side character towards the end. I wish that had not happened given the fact that she really had some awesome chemistry with Lee Min Ho.Lee Jin Pyu always knew how this was going to end, but he ensured his son got the happiness he always craved for. Only if he had understood long ago that in the happy world that Yoon sung dreamt of, he wanted his father too. Then again, I am so glad Lee Jin Pyo killed 3 of them :3 And finally, Yoon Sung the city hunter- Lee Min Ho was absolutely worth watching through out the show. His outstanding action skills were simply justified by the fact that he lived 28 years of his life learning them from a father, who appeared to be heartless from the outside. He loved his father, and in the entire show there was this one dialogue that made me fall in love with him-\"I will protect the ones who are precious to me and that includes you father.\" And he did stand by this statement till the end. He couldn't kill Lee Jin Pyo- he loved his father after all, so he decided to kill himself instead. The last scene leaves you teary eyed and shaken. Only if there was a way for Lee Jin Pyo and Yoon sung to have a happy ending.Watch this show for father-son relationship. Watch this show for the thrill and the emotions. It is worth it.I must admin that I love how the heroes in k dramas are not killers in the name of revenge- Healer, k2 and now City Hunter. Blood for blood isn't always revenge. It is a never ending curse!", "I've seen many Korean dramas, and this one is on the top of my list. I'll make this short, and I know I sound cheesy saying this was a 10 out of 10, but I truly think that this deserves this rating. I love action with a bit of romance, so this drama was perfect for me. Hope you can watch it soon!", "I started this show with mixed feelings, and at the beginning I have to admit everything seemed similar in episodes, but it touched me. The story is multilayered, somehow real no matter there was some \"mistakes, as the plastic guns, how fast a wound from gunshot is healing without even a scar, same five songs or the flood of memories which repeated four times when Nana and Yoon Sung split. Anyway I have to say I couldn't stop thinking \"what will happen next\" in the break between episodes. Every character in this film has his own story and you like it or hate it, but there are no moments where something is missing and you wonder \"why happened this way and not that way\"? I hated to see how Jin Pyo was torturing his own \"son\" and the revealing the truth at the end was completely unexpected, their actions and decisions too. I voted with 9 because this film left me with mixed feelings as I said - about every one character I loved and hated at the same time. You created a story with deep meaning and personal fight for every single one of them. You have my regards! It was a pleasure to watch!", "Only discovered City Hunter drama in last year 2016 after I started watching Heirs and Personal Taste which lead me to search for another drama under Lee Min Ho. After watching almost all drama acted by Lee Min Ho ,City Hunter is the best drama and i like it the most. Not only the story line is interesting but both the lead actors (Lee Min HO and Park Min Young) is the most matching and perfect couple which make the drama so interesting. But the ending part of the story is not satisfying because is a puzzle to the audience whether is Kim Na Na and Lee Yoon Sang will together happily ever after. Their chemistry is really good. I started to fall in love with this minmin couples. But i know is too late because now they have separated. I felt so sad to read about they broke up. I sincerely hope that in one fine day, Lee Min Ho and Park Min Young will get back together again. They are really so matching together among all Lee Min Ho co-star that he has worked together. Love to see both so playful and laugh together so happily.", "Been selecting the past Korean Drama to watch from the old kungfu series to new modern era.Trying a few numbers actually from the old era till the new era to be specific More like something decent to watch. Well I landed this one instead. Yokoosso well two thumbs up. The character for Kim Na Na is just fabulous and just fits the bill. Great mixture of romance and action in the drama it is definitely not typical Korean love story per say.Most importantly it is a family safe to watch drama if of course one notion that you disregard the amount of fighting violence in a show .. than this show is a definite recommendation.", "Korea has given us some amazing films over the past 15-20 years, and being a big fan of their action-thrillers, I decided to check out their TV programmes... Wow, are they bad.The first thing noticed with Korea TV shows is that they all look cheap and quickly made. Yes, there is crane and dolly work, and they seem to frown on the detestable shaky-cam that plagues Western TV nowadays, but it's as if somebody said, \"Hey, I have a 4K camera, let's make a TV programme,\" and to hell with aesthetics.The second thing - which is also quickly noticed - is how bad the dialogue is. Films are seemingly honed to near perfection, whereas dialogue in Korean TV programmes (or, at least, in the handful I've tried to watch), meanders, repeats itself and is plain corny.City Hunter, unfortunately, isn't an exception to the above. I got one and a half episodes in before I had to question why I was subjecting myself to such nonsense!The plot plays out like a teenage melodrama disguised as an action-thriller, but ridiculous coincidences, bad characters, slow pacing and action sequences massively below the level I was expecting (not to mention how infrequently their occur), soon nailed its coffin shut. There's also the tiny factor of complete implausibility, as some kid who was effectively raised in the jungle somewhere near Cambodia, is speaking with modern Korean dialect and accent, and posing as an American computer genius... despite not being able to speak a word of English or having ever seen a computer!Oh, and working for and interacting directly with the Korean president is a given, when you have a fake degree from MIT.So, if you're a fan of Korean TV already (not that I can fathom why), you may be able to overlook all the stupidity and badness and enjoy the tall lead with his spiffy hair, or the admittedly gorgeous character of Kim Na Na, regardless of how preachy and imposing she acts, but for those who love Korean cinema and are looking to give their TV a go, look elsewhere (and I hope that you find higher quality programmes than all the \"recommended\" ones that I did).", "Unfortunately, this series starts out fairly well, but then about 1/3 of the way through it really starts going downhill.If the series had stuck to the main plot and characters it would have been OK, but the introduction of never-resolved subplots, and totally extraneous characters ended up spoiling it for me. For example, far too much time was spent on the totally air-headed presidents daughter, who added nothing at all to the story, and is left at a dead end. Flashbacks were way overdone - it seemed like the object was to fill up space rather than advance the plot.In general, the main plot and most subplots are so full of holes and unresolved issues that have to wonder if 3 hours or so was assembled from outtakes to fill the alloted number of episodes.If you are a Korean Drama fan, \"Lie to Me\" and \"My Girlfriend is a Gumiho\" are much better choices. The series started out like \"The Dirty Dozen\" and ended like the purple dinosaur \"Barney Goes to School\" video.", "This show is absurd.There are some conventions in K-dramas that you know you must accept: people sleep fully clothed, doors are never locked, a few hospital scenes, one or both characters are orphans, mobile phones are used extensively except when most needed, and so on. I accept all of those.But I can't get past the impossible coincidences, the gigantic plot holes, the irrational behavior...The screenplay is so consistently poor and childish that you wonder if the writers were elementary school kids.Once again I'm left with the impression that the only truly good K-drama is \"My lovely Kim Sam-soon\"", "I am not a big fan of K.dramas but when we watch drama there should smooth flow , if ordinance have to tern off TV that drama not worth for penny .\nunfortunately i felt that feeling because of some stupid story lines !\nif you find poor boy Instead poor girl. that would be 1% all K Dramas in the worldSBS network has long drama list , but my opinion this one have same core plot like other all dramas ,if you willing to watch this drama again . i would say . dont wast your time", "I watched this after \"The Heirs\" I thought this was different and exiting and thrilling, but as episodes went on it became boring and lame.Its just the same as other Lee Min Ho's Korean TV drama. He always got the girl and being the rich and famous. I love Lee Min Ho but I hope his next drama will not be just cuteness and sexiness. I liked this drama more if its written in much more mature way. maybe the writer forgot about the age of the characters. :(", "I did not know what to expect but decided to give it a shot and loved every moment. I rarely watch TV but gave this a shot and could not stop watching. I am a type of person where it takes months to finish a show that is 12 episodes long, let alone 20 like this.But after each episode there would be a cliff hanger that made me not want to stop. In the span of 2 days, I watched each and every episode and boy was I happy that I tried this and was a taken back by it's meaningful scenes, well placed and paced action and terrific writing.The story it's about a man, a son and revenge for a crime that happened in the past. It is more complex but that is it. It's an action packed thrill ride, with a dash of romance and mystery. It might even be considered a superhero show by some.I do recommend skipping episode 1 simply because their is more mystery to the characters and I think you as a viewer will enjoy it slightly better by trying to figure out the relationships and the bonds each character has to one another.HIGHLY RECOMMEND 10 out of 10. Might be the best TV series I ever saw, America or Korea or Japanese."], "936": ["It's really hard to surprise me with drama plots, because I've seen so many Korean, Japanesse drama series. Well...maybe it's possible. This story is unpredictable, realistic character relationships and the chemistry between the two main characters is undeniable. I would recommend it to everybody who likes mystery, detective, romance and little bit of sci-fi. And of course the actor Jong-Suk Lee, have you ever seen him in a bad drama? Definitely, not! I think his acting skills makes this drama so watchable. As I said, this drama is \"excellent without a doubt\"", "Excellent story with some excellent cast. I never felt bored watching this drama. It is now in my fav list", "I really liked the plot of this kdrama. I haven't seen anything like this before and it was interesting to see how the story panned out. There are so many characters involved in the situation and it was shocking to see how interconnected they are. A minor detail can affect an event in the life of someone else. The cinematography was also very beautiful. I found many of the setting of the scenes or the shot very pleasing to the eyes. I have many screenshots saved because of it.The characters that were created were fun and entertaining to watch. Hong Joo was pretty weird but in a good and fun way. Jae Chan was also like that. It was fun to see how brave he wanted to be seen when deep inside he doesn't really know what he's doing with his life. He just tries his best. Woo Tak was a wonderful addition to that. He was kind and adorable and very precious. I loved them all. Each of the actors portrayed their roles wonderfully and they had a good dynamic with each other.", "Love movies with fantasy shells have a high proportion of love, and the plot is too simple and straight. Several of the leading actors could hardly feel the acting skills. The hostess is very beautiful.", "I didn't expect much on this drama at first, but watching this drama to 20 episode. It was surprisingly much better than expected. There was good funny scenes in drama that I LMAO a lot. The story was good, the best was humor of drama, that i didn't expect laugh a lot. And it was also romantic, but in artistic way, that asians dramas usually has.", "In just finished this one, it has everything you can ask for- suspense, romance, comedy, wow moments. You will not get bored even for a single second. Kudos to the team!", "Korean drama never cease to amaze me. My first Korean drama being Goblin, it's with fascination that I continued to watch them. A lot of my friends were talking about While You Were Sleeping, and I think, along with my previous experiences with Korean drama, it kinda set the bar high. Don't get me wrong, this drama was bloody amazing!\nI'd not say it was totally unpredictable, but my favorite part of this drama was Lee Yoo-bum. This character blew me away! Lee Sangyeob has to be one of the best actor I have seen in a Korean drama so far. No matter how much I hated him, I was still totally amazed at how complex, and rich in depth this character was! He's probably one of the best reason to watch this show. I wanted to know what was up with him? Where his evil comes from?Only negative point in my opinion, was the chemistry between the two main characters. I know a lot of people mentioned it as a positive factor, but I didn't feel it. I preferred her relationship with Han Wootak, which I felt was authentic and flowing better. That's really my only reservation. It didn't bother me whatsoever. It was an amazing drama to watch and I would recommend it to anyone who likes this genre of drama. It was not disappointing.", "It started off very interesting (somehow a little bit confusing) with beautiful cinematography and very creative transitions. Unfortunately they got lost really quick towards the middle and only appeared now and then.I liked the characters. All of them. Yes, even the villain (who, in my opinion, was the worst villain ever). Nevertheless there was something bothering me about Hong Joo. Throughout the whole drama she seemed off and a little bit emotionless. Well, I don't know exactly if that's because of the actress' acting skills or just the character itself. She was too neutral, I guess, because I didn't feel anything for her.\nLjs did a very good job. I wasn't sure about him in the beginning but he quickly proved himself to be great, especially in the end showing off amazing performances I fell in love with.\nNow to my favorit character Woo Tak. The actor was amazing as well and he did great potraying the character. My favorit scenes were probably the one's with him in them.\nInvestigator Choi. Great character even greater actor. Nothing more to say.The story has its ups and downs as every other drama.\n16 episodes were pretty solid. More would have been boring.\nThe storyline became a little bit simple and boring towards the middle but picked it up at time.I feel a bit uneasy about the romance. I liked both of the characters and I liked them together as well. I liked the amount of romance and how they handled situations (there were some parts were I screamed 'KISSEU' but besides those it was okay), HOWEVER I feel like I could have lived without it.\nI wished Woo Tak was given the love interest he deserved too but at the same time I'm glad he wasn't because he doesn't have to be with a girl in order to become happy. So that I liked very much.\nI wish he was given more scenes though.The show was very well written and it was interesting to see how all of the different characters get connected through the story. Everything seemed flawless.There is one thing I must admit though. I did not cry at any moment throughout the entire show. And there alse has been no scene that made me really laugh. A few scenes with minor laughing moments but nothing too much.\nWhich is sad because I feel more attached to a show if I can laugh and cry with the characters along. Did not happen at this case.It started off good, lost some energy toward the middle and picked it up at the end again.

I'm the unpopular opinion (again...). Anyway, \"While you were sleeping\" started so so strong, with beautiful cinematography and griping story, dreamy like. Unfortunately, the cinematography later on appeared here and there only, and I really, really wish that they had more of it, like Goblin. Another plus was the cast. Love the two leads, but Suzy wasn't at her best. Maybe it was her character that was kind of odd and annoying at some point, but it just didn't work. Not that her performance wasn't great, it just felt like the role wasn't for her... The love story and the couples chemistry, moreover, was okay and really good at first, but kind of felt weak towards the middle, picked up though towards the ending. In addition, the soundtrack was perfect! Really good indeed, Scarlet heart quality (you should check it out if you're interested in OSTs). Finally, the cases: they were interesting at first, but they got weaker and weaker, especially as the story focused on the couple rather than them.

It's (spoilers) a melodrama!SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Our main lead stars as a young single civil service worker that's tired of seeing her old school friends getting married, achieve more than her, leaving her behind, etc. She thinks she's becoming one big failure in life, while everyone else she knows has gone on to bigger and better things. There's one particular close girl friend of hers that continually enjoys rubbing salt in our main lead's wounds time and time again. Finally fed up with the increasing peer pressure from her friends, and what she perceives as her own shortcomings, our young heroine eventually cracks and she one day impulsively blurts outs a silly off handed lie to all her friends that she just got married to a rich, handsome, perfect, young, hotel heir (who is the male lead in the show).Quickly realizing her mistake, and mortified by her momentary act of childish stupidity, our young lead wants to rectify the absurd situation she's created for herself as best she can, but she has her pride at stake, and the damage has already been done anyway. Rumors about the marriage soon start spreading across Korea like wildfire, and she inadvertently impresses a hugely important future business partner as the fake wife of the young hotel heir along the way. As such, the two leads soon find themselves thrust together as a result of the circumstances at hand. Our young heroine wants to impress her friends, and our young hotel heir needs to impress his future business partners, so the two of them agree to pretend to be married to help each other achieve their own goals. The two leads couldn't be more different from one another. He's polished, well to do, smart, and reserved. She's ordinary, perky, frank, and full of heart. The fake marriage & web of lies they've both agreed to implement becomes increasingly harder to maintain as time goes on, and, they eventually need to find a suitable exit strategy asap. But, of course, they've both now fallen in love with each other during their time together, so parting ways is not that simple or easy when it comes time for the both of them to do so. Our young male lead is played by Kang Ji-hwan. Gosh he's good looking, and he strikes a real nice balance between what's needed to be the leading man in his role as the young hotel heir and romantic interest. There is little, if anything, to not like about his performance or the character he plays. He does a terrific job all in all, but there's no questioning who the star of this show is; that would be Yoon Eun-hye. I can't stress enough how impressive Eun-hye is in her role here as the earnest hard working normal girl who eventually falls for the male lead. I can't vouch for her acting range outside of this genre, but she's pitch perfect and adorable here, and the performance she gives makes her character, and this story, almost impossible not to like & root for. The two leads occupy more and more of the main storyline as this series progresses, and they make for a great on screen couple. There's a host of other side characters, some of which you're sure will morph into the main evil bad person sooner or later, but that never really happens! What passes as the antagonists in this story (the Aunt, the brother, the former love interest, the bitchy girlfriend) don't ever get around to being overly unreasonable, or become an overbearing problem that must be dealt with via typical melodramatic methods. In fact, though not without their faults or occasional schemes, you'll likely find yourself hoping these \"antagonists\" all make out well for themselves when all is said and done.This show is about as cute as can be. From the story, to the script, to the performances of everybody involved, to the soundtrack, etc. This type of stuff is not really my cup of tea, but, I must confess that I rather liked this show quite a bit more than I thought I would.If you're a fan of KTV melodramas, you'll probably like this show. If you're unfamiliar with the genre, but are wanting to check out a pretty solid romantic love story, look no further!Bottom Line: 8 out of 10 stars! Well Recommended!", "I love a mini-series as a melodrama that tells a story in the long movie format, as opposed to those that tell different stories in the same setting (like Grey's Anatomy, Mad Men and to a lesser extent Damages, Breaking Bad, and Revenge that change the story at times while keeping to a general story). In this regard, I have discovered some gems in the South Korean TV mini-series of recent years.The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back. This me recur in the same story. Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved. If personality dynamics are properly depicted in a valid manner, and if the production is skillful, powerful emotions can be evoked in the viewer. In this way we can live many lifetimes through movies, in our one lifetime - greatly enriching our incarnate experience. These South Korean productions (seen on Netflix streaming) are first class with excellent production and direction, some terrific casting and acting (particularly from some of the females who give some matchless world class performances), brilliant musical accompaniment, and staging. What makes these so good is the way they skillfully evoke deep emotion in the viewer. South Korean movie making is superb - world class.However, the following caveats must be considered by the USA viewer. They are subtitled and some people hate this. The South Korean cultural norms, values and sanctions may sometimes seems silly or old fashioned to the USA viewer. The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation/unity - sometimes reminiscence of a old Frank Capra film.Most importantly, in order for the sometimes complicated sub-plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing, and this leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people, that sometimes seem to be unlikely by USA cultural standards. The viewer may wonder at times why good but trusting people are so easily manipulated and deceived by bad and selfish people, but con artists do often succeed (just look at politicians for example). However this poetic license of improbability is needed to develop the story - just accept it as occurring even though unlikely at times. Taking these factors into account Will help you become involved and emotionally engrossed.

The Great DoctorLie To Me is a fun romantic story that shows how an innocent lie can get out of control with complicated and wide-ranging effects. This is the premise of Chaos theory - a small and relatively insignificant event can expand into a large complex of effects that are totally unpredictable considering the origin - commonly depicted as a butterfly flaps its wings and the end result is a storm on the other side of the world (a somewhat misleading analogy but it illustrates the idea). Well done as is typical of these South Korean TV mini-series", "Lie To Me is a 16-episode drama that deals about the love story between Gong Ah Jung, a Ministry of Culture official, gets entangled in a web of lies when she mistakenly lies that she's married to Hyun Ki Joon, a hotel president.The story focuses on mainly on their relationship as it develops from being in fake marriage into becoming a real couple in a romantic relationship.The Kdrama was interesting from episodes 1 to 12. But after that,it became draggy and the story written went all over the place as it tries to focus on many things instead of the development of the relationship to the next level.Too bad that the writers tried to give the viewer some so-called \"crying moments\" but to no avail. It only minimized the story into a clich\u00e9d and predictable one.Should this have ended at episode 12? My guess is probably as good as the guess of the majority of the those who saw it.With regards to the cast,the drama mainly relied on the main leads' appeal and screen presence when it reached episode 13.The plot was great before that considering that there was a story going on but not towards the end.Too bad that people may feel bored once they reached 3/4 of the drama. Anyway,I still commend both Yoon Eun Hye and Kang Ji Hwan for their great performances despite the not-so-good screenplay. They made the most out of the material of the drama. Overall,both performances made it one above average drama instead of a decent one.After watching Lie To Me,I should classify this is as a typical drama wherein all the elements of a Korean drama series are present.Also,it is not an exceptional one compared to the ones made by Yoon Eun Hye in the past the Kdrama classic like The First Shop of the Coffee Prince nor did it have an intriguing storyline like Princess Hours. I think that it did capitalize more on her looks and appeal just like her leading man, Kang Ji Hwan.Sad but true. I think that Yoon Eun Hye is a very talented actress.She obviously can do comedy and drama effectively.But it is about time that she does something more challenging to elevate her status as a talented actress.If top actresses like Son Ye-Jin can play various roles in both movies and dramas like being a divorc\u00e9e,pickpocket thief,a young woman suffering from dementia,an adulteress and a very naive woman; and Gianna Jun can take her chances in Hollywood wherein the chance for success for an Asian actor/actress is very limited unless he is an action star like Jackie Chan; I think that Yoon Eun Hye can do the same. Great actresses do not rely on their looks and appeal but on their talent and ability to take chances.The same is true for Yoon Eun Hye. She already did excel in a challenging role like playing a woman pretending to be a man in Coffee Prince,then I don't see any reason why she can't do something similar to this in the future.I hope that she does more of these types of roles in her future projects instead of playing it safe just like her role in Lie To Me.", "Lie to Me had a flimsy story premise. A woman irritated that her friend has stolen her first love, lies that she is married. What happens after that is not good storytelling.What I liked:a) Physical chemistry between the lead actors Yoon Eun-hye and Kang Ji- hwan is good. Three passionate kisses (by kdrama standards) - Karoke in Episode 6, Coke Kiss Episode 8, Final Kiss Episode 16.b) Likable Male Lead, Kang Ji-hwan is good looking and adorable when his character was able to cut loose a bit. Unfortunately the story was so uneven: he hates her, he loves her, he has to honor his former relationship, he doesn't believe her, marriage or bust, it was like watching multiple personalities.c) couple of good songs on the soundtrack.What I didn't like:a) Annoying Female Lead, Yoon Eun-hye was so good in Coffee Prince, I was shocked how the character bugged me the first 6 episodes, was OK the next 5 episodes, then annoying again. Much of this was bad writing, but the actress chose over-the-top physical acting in the first 6 episodes which I had a negative reaction to. I did not find this character charming. The character seemed to cry loudly in EVERY episode. b) The story line was flimsy without providing characters to care about. No matter how hard the actors tried, there's no way they could save this empty plot. Lie to Me is like being served a rice cake when you were hoping for a delicious dessert."], "940": [], "941": [], "942": ["Greatest Love (also known as Discovery of Affection and Best Love) is another \"which guy loves which girl\" Korean melodrama. The story revolves around two main leads trying to discover if they love each other, along with 2 other characters which are battling for the leads affections.SPOILERS AHEAD!The two leads are played by Gong Hyo Jin and Cha Seung Won. The former plays a washed up past girl band member just trying to stay relevant and milk her few waning seconds of fame. The latter plays the biggest star in Korea at the top of his fame.Hyo-Jin is really good in her role as Ae Jung. Ae Jung has long been forgotten by most everyone following the Korean entertainment industry, and, those few people that do remember her can't stand her. Image and perception play a big part of many of the character arcs and story lines in this show, and Ae Jung's public image is that of a plain awful troublemaker. In reality though, she's just an earnest and charming sweetheart with virtually zero faults, who's just trying to get by in life.Seung Won plays the role of Go Jin. There's no two ways about it; Seung Won has a commanding screen presence; he's tall and ripped, with a deep voice and rugged features. He can be considered good looking I suppose, but he's also one downright menacing looking dude. As such, I wonder if he just takes these types of roles in order to solely avoid getting forever typecast as the \"ass kicker/villain/rogue cop/etc\" that he appears to have been genetically engineered to play. He's quite impressive here as the narcissistic and tyrannical superstar on the outside, with a soft spot on the inside.The two other characters are played the lovely Yoo In Na and the terribly handsome Yoon Kye Sang. In Na portrays Ae Jung's former band mate who's become hugely popular in the 10 years since the group disbanded. She's also the host of a dating show that matches eligible Korean bachelors to various female stars. Kye Sang plays a rich young doctor that's a little slow on the up take with the ladies, and is completely uninterested in the ultra image conscious Korean entertainment industry.The story has Ae Jung and Go Jin inadvertently bumping into each other time and again. Feeling a little sorry for her, he uses his star power to help her career out some by throwing her a bone; this eventually results in Ae Jung being one of the suitors on the dating show that In Na's character hosts. The doctor is the bachelor contestant on the dating show.Meanwhile, In Na's character and Go Jin are a popular couple in the entertainment world (but are not actually a couple in real life). Go Jin slowly takes more and more of a liking to Ae Jung as time passes. In Na's character has been absorbed in the entertainment industry life for so long, that she's taken aback and soon smitten with the doctor she has to work with on the dating show that has no idea who she is and treats he like an everyday person. The doctor gets more and more inclined to select Ae Jung as his match on the dating show, because her personality and approach to life is most suited to his own. You can tell where all this is headed from there; all you have to do is just follow along to see who will be and won't be with whom, and for how long, and why.There are a number of sides stories sprinkled in, one of the cuter (although not major) ones, being the bond between Go Jin and Ae Jung's cute seven year old chunky & dorky nephew. The interaction between these 2 characters is pretty amusing as Go Jin continually tries to use this child to get closer to Ae Jung. At first, Go Jin (who knows nothing about children) is mostly an obnoxious and manipulative brute who frequently and openly makes fun of this kid (which he refers to as Ding Dong). Over time though, Go Jin comes to look at this nephew as his little adopted brother who he takes under his wing and gives life lessons to, helps become more popular at school, etc. In turn, the nephew becomes sort of a surrogate friend to the arrogant superstar who really doesn't have any friends of his own or anyone to confide in.This show is pretty standard fare for this genre (i.e. it's a romantic drama with a bit of humor thrown in). You'll likely find it fairly agreeable if you enjoy this type of stuff. It's a 16 episode love quadrangle, with a number of side/back stories, and one of the characters might be dying of heart failure, so you should know by now what you're in for here if you watch this.There's a good bit to like here. The four main cast members all put in good work and interact well together, writing is mostly solid, and it maintains a nice comedic romance feel for the bulk of the series. I was not particularly fond of how this show incorporated the plot regarding the heart problems of the one character, however; it couldn't seem to decide whether this should be used for comedic or dramatic effect or how much of an integral part it should play. Also, I think they dropped ball a bit over the last few episodes trying to wrap up all the story lines, but that's the way it goes sometimes with many of these shows.Entertaining and plenty enjoyable overall...it's more than solid enough to recommend. I'd rate it in the 7-8 star range, and, I may have closely considered giving it the elusive 9 star rating I only rarely give out, if they'd tightened up the ending a little. Nevertheless, it is one of the better all around KTV melodramas.Final Score: 8 stars!", "I am a fan of Gong Hyo-jin (Gu Ae Jung). She does feisty really well. I also enjoyed her in Pasta. One aspect of the plot that might be hard for viewers to pick up comes in the first scenes when heart surgery is being performed on Doko Jin(Seung-won Cha). There is a Treasure Girls CD being played which Doko Jin hears subconsciously. This subconscious imprint is part of what accounts for his reaction to Gu Ae Jung, who has the song as her phone ring. I'm not sure if the other reviewer picked up on this. As with all programs from other countries you need to take into account cultural difference. Male-female relationships and sexual mores are different in Korea. And always remember, it is a TV show, not the real world."], "943": ["A perfect demonstration of how in today's world personality traits of being callous, innocent, naive and gullible aren't looked as attractive, lovable or even charming when it comes to chasing dreams.

While I was doubtful on how they could make the story as compelling as the first one, this sequel delivers by focusing on the backstories of Ganglim and his crew. It also slowly builds around the previous story without retreading on the old plot. Furthermore, it also provides closure to the first part by seeing the aftermath of the events of the first movie. In fact, there are three layers of stories, the conclusion of the first part, Ganglim and his crew's backstories, and a new mission for the team while Ganglim is occupied. Jung-woo Ha returns as Ganglim and is every relatable while maintain a charismatic performance. Ji-Hoon Ju's character is given another side the audience has not seen, while the ever-likable Hyang-gi Kim's still shines.

Plot-wise there are many twists and though some could be predicted, others are not. There are great after credit scenes too, and something that looks like the starting of a franchise.

Still don't cover the fact that it's an awesome movie", "After a surprisingly good first movie (with tear jerking story lines); I had high expectations on the sequel. It didn't disappoint me but it's not as good as the first one either.\nBad Points: \nThe movie is full of cliche, drama , and coincidences that I am really watching a typical Asian drama movie. Seriously, almost all characters in the movie are connected to each other somehow with the little twist and there.\nIn addition, this movie didn't develop the side characters really well. I understand the sequel focus is on the three guardians and their past but somehow the side characters which supposedly have major roles are sidelined and seems to exist to cater to the major story line. It's not very bad as they still have their moments, but I am just disappointed on this part of the movie.Good Points:\nCliche and drama moments aside, this movie carries a great message that it suppose to give to audiences; human values and forgiveness. I mentioned previously that I am not disappointed because this movie still gives out a great story line despite the cliches. If the first one gives u heavy water works, then this sequel gives u deeper understanding on forgiveness and human sins. \nThe visual is great ; and the acting here is amazing which blends with the great story line.Conclusion: This movie is great if you get pass all the typical Asian cliche drama because it got great story line, promising premise which can set a great universe , good settings and great acting. It might not be as great as the first one, but it's still a great movie to watch.", "Each character, message, scene together make the movie worth repeated viewings", "By now, you would have probably heard of this unexpected hit of a South-Korean title. Yes, it already had all the makings of a blockbuster, but it surpassed even projections by pundits. Surpassing 10 million viewers in only 15 days, Along with the Gods: The Two Worlds tripled returns of the US$36 million investment on the 2-parter, and became the second highest-grossing film of all time in Korea.Most importantly, it will be remembered as \"that emotional rollercoaster of a film that kept my waterworks going\".Given my history with the franchise, I prepared an extra packet of tissues for the viewing of the sequel. But sadly, I hardly used a piece. Although both titles were shot together, Along with the Gods: The Last 49 Days feels like a distant product. It pushed up the sliders on scale and size, but lost the epic in their storytelling and pacing.What happened, Director Kim Yong-hwa?The film returns us to hell, and along with the three guardians Gang-lim (Ha Jung-woo), Haewonmak (Ju Ji-hoon) and Lee Deok-choon (Kim Hyang-gi), we now accompany new paragon Kim Soo-hong (Kim Dong-wook) - brother of first episode's paragon, Kim Ja-hong - through his trials.While the first chapter had Ja-hong as the plot anchor, The Last 49 Days turns our attention to the 3 guardians and their mysterious past. This, to me, is where the sequel flounders.It's not long before we splinter into various story arcs. There's the main story of the trio's pasts, retold through increasingly frustrating flashbacks that sometimes last no more than a minute. Then there's the added task from King Yeomra, which dispatches Haewonmak and Deok-choon to claim a long-overdue soul, Hur Choon-sam (Nam Il-woo).Turns out the old fellow (who appears briefly in the first film) is protected by his ultra-powerful resident Household God Seongju (Ma Deok-seok). As the two guardians struggle to wrestle the deity into submission, they find out not only his reason for protecting his client, but also that he was an ex-guardian who was there at their own passing - thus a key to retrieving their memories.Add to that, Gang-lim's supposed agenda is throwing in all his chips to get Soo-hong reincarnated, Soo-hong's own unwillingness to do so because he doesn't want to believe that his friends murdered him, Seongju's bout with failed investments and helping his actual charge (Choon-sam's grandson) to find a real guardian, and you have essentially a very diluted film. Even King Yeomra is not spared with his own little twist!By sowing 49 Days with so much storyline, a deft director might still be able to measure out portions of steer his priorities in the right direction to maintain a strong plot with a moral compass like the first. But Kim dropped the hat on this one. The second episode flickers back and forth stories incoherently, and makes for a frustrating viewing.Most annoying of all is Soo-hong's temperamental behaviour. It seems to serve only as a catalyst to drive Gang-lim's actions, and loses potency because of it. Gang-lim's own guilt-laden agenda is also slightly unbearable, given how it was obvious halfway what it was really all about.While the film does still feature gorgeous graphics and settings, it has lost a slight shine from the first film's reveal. We get to see a new scene for Indolence Hell, but other new segments really raise eyebrows in the wrong way. One word - dinosaurs.Along with the Gods: The Last 49 Days stays on track in terms of a continuation, but the calibre is far more hollow than the first. You'll get to enjoy some light sobbing at the end, but this second chapter leaves no lasting impression.Let's hope the next episode fares better. And yes, there will be one.", "Do not watch this sequel without first watching the first one.In terms of cinematics, there seems to be less compared with the first. Yet the drama, wit & humor are truly delightful.", "If the first movie epitomises redemption, then the sequel dives headlong into forgiveness. Along With the Gods: The Two Worlds was a helluva ride through the underworld; the only misstep for me is how it went overboard with the ludicrous special effects. By that I mean how the vengeful spirit and Gang Rim go mano a mano with the city as their playground. The sequel, Along With the Gods: The Last 49 Days, was shot together with the massively popular first film and it has become the second all-time box-office grosser in South Korea. However, it is an overstuffed shadow of the first film.The sequel begins moments after the end of The Two Worlds, with the three guardians, Gang Rim (Ha Jung-woo), Haewonmak (Ju Ji-hoon) and Lee Dukchun (Kim Hyang-gi) guiding their 49th soul Kim Soo-hong (Kim Dong-wook), the brother of Kim Ja-hong, to the trials for his reincarnation. The stakes are higher because if it is successful, the three guardians will also be reincarnated. King Yeomra (Lee Jung-jae), Lord of the Afterlife, agrees to a fair trail on the condition that Gang Rim proceeds with the case on his own, while Haewonmak and Dukchun go down to the world of humans to dispatch a troublesome housegod Sung-joo (Ma Dong-seok) and ascend an overdue soul.The Last 49 Days has a lot to live up to and it just could not sustain under the weight of expectations set by its predecessor. The first half becomes a bit of a slog with the pacing largely going missing and the world-building taking a backseat. This is a case of lightning not being able to strike the same spot twice.Firstly, the chemistry between the three guardians of the Afterlife went missing in the first two acts, partly because Gang Rim and his compatriots are separated. Like The Two Worlds, the narrative becomes two-pronged but sadly neither reaches the same dizzying levels. Soo-hong makes for an annoying and smart-alecky character, who doesn't garner the same sympathy as his brother, Ja-hong. It is a good move that the story doesn't go through the same process as Ja-hong but what takes its place doesn't make for compelling viewing, and dinosaurs don't help. Haewonmak and Dukchun fare better because of the intriguing character of Sung-joo, a superb casting choice. However, this time round the Stephen-Chow-resque slapstick comedy is a hit or miss.Secondly, director Kim Yong-hwa couldn't quite find the right balance between the light fantastic and the hard-hitting drama, which led to pacing issues, so much so that I did the dreaded thing - I checked my watch.However, all is not lost... when the story does hit the final act with the story of the three guardians revealed, it hits its groove. But still, one can't help but feel it came a little too late to save the movie.", "The second movie of the Along with the Gods series was entertaining, but not as good as the first one. Whethere the first one was backed with emotions and twists, this one was just a good movie about two things, the trial of the last movie's lead's brother and the past of the three grim reapers massed up in the story of a young boy and his grand father. The story about the boy and the background story on the three main characters were interesting and kind of sad. The trial part, however, failed to impress. And when all the stories came together, it was a quick and awkward mass up, concluding everything so we could move on to the next chapter about the othe soldier, whose story will be presented in the third movie. I just hope that the last one will be the best one.\nOther than that, the performances were really well by all the actors in the film and they actually looked natural.

I recommend it.", "Along with the Gods: The Last 49 Days is the sequel to Along with the Gods: The Two Worlds and a vast improvement over the first part that suffered from a chaotic story line, exaggerated special effects and shallow characters. This sequel gives the characters involved more depth by telling their moving background stories that are all cleverly interwoven. The plot is more structured despite numerous flashbacks and side stories and leaves no questions unanswered at the end. The special effects are still present but used with precision, intellect and care this time around.There are only a few minor elements to criticize. The movie is slightly overlong with a length of one hundred forty-two minutes. The film could have been shortened by at least fifteen minutes or so in the middle section. Another problem is that the film tries to be a tearjerker and while several scenes are genuinely moving, the last third of the film feels overtly melancholic. It's so intense towards the end that it almost becomes a parody.Still, the character development, detailed plot and better use of special effects make this blockbuster a vast improvement over the first part. If you haven't watched the first movie however, you won't fully understand what's going on in this one. If one puts the two movies together as a complete piece of art, it's a decent to very good blockbuster comparable to contemporary Hollywood cinema with its breathtaking effects but at times shallow stories.", "First off, I loved the first part to the core. It was action-packed, emotional and magical.This happens with LAST 49 DAYS also. It has a lot of action, drama, some comedy and twists presented in a screenplay that is thoroughly engaging and will keep you hooked to the end despite of long duration.The guardians are all excellent as before, but this time their characters have been explored so well that no glitches matter after a point of time. Ha Jung-woo excels in the film with his strong expressions and dialogue delivery. Surprisingly enough, Ju Ji-hoon takes the cake for an astonishing performance, while Kim Hyang-gi still delivers a cute performance. Ma Dong-seok is a worthy addition to the cast and you'll love his character. Lee Jung-jae is brilliant as he was in the first one. Kim Dong-wook is superb.The action sequences are once again breathtaking but this time the director has kept them more grounded. From chases to superhero-esque fights to sword fights etc: every action block clicks. The director has used action sequences in a very interesting way, making them an integral part of the story while not losing grip on the characters or story. Visual effects are still dazzling but the focus seems more on story than CGI so it's a little less glossy than the prequel.The emotional depth of the characters makes them extremely likable.

In this regard, I have discovered some gems in the South Korean TV mini-series of recent years.The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back. This me recur in the same story. Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved.

The Great DoctorShining inheritance is about family, love, greed, deceit, manipulation, altruism, and other dynamics important in the pursuit of happiness. It is nicely paced over 28 episodes, in fully developing the story, but the viewer must stick with it at least halfway to get the full emotional impact of the story. Perhaps more coherent than other of the above mini-series, it could be your favorite.", "Just finished watching this drama, although it's dated it's still worth a watch if you are watching Korean TV drama. I saw past reviews and it compared this show to current US drama. This is much different this show is warm, chilling and frightening at the same time. I can't believe that there are people in the world like this.This is s family drama unlike current shows on mainstream TV where \"coitus\" is in every sentence. This is different a family show that's is very emotional. Well acted, well written (a bit long). The first episode is a bit confusing as the characters are not clearly explained but stick with it, gets better with each episode.Even if you think you are not an emotional person, it's hard not to be with this show, even the music is touching and I don't even know the words. If you watch this show and don't feel sad along the way then If you are into Korean TV drama I would say that this rates very high among those I have watched, but I have a long list to get through. Although I would rate \"That Fool\" at the top of my list.As well the main actress is enough of a reason to watch the show, if you ever wanted to picture an \"angel\" she is it. I first saw her in a movie 'Cold Eyes' and I thought she was beautiful. But in this drama she is beyond that. A picture of an Angel with a smile that's warm and sincere.SPOILER ALERT: The show is a bit long seems as though that the writers wanted everyone (main cast) to have some hardship before the end, which is predictable happens. Although the end is a bit different than the other shows that I have watched (in other shows:everyone goes off on their own in the end). This show is different as it brings/intertwines all the cast into situations that are semi-realistic. But I thought that the \"witch\" and the \"witchette\" got of way too easy. Watch this drama you won't be disappointed, I am not a binge watcher but these dramas have changed that concept for me.", "I'm a regular viewer of kdramas, some I love some questionable. This was nice to watch but in my opinion, 28 episodes was too long. Sometimes by my own admittance I can have a short time span unless the story is really rivetting. Although the storyline had a good premise, I quite couldn't agree with the ending and therefore slightly disappointed. Unless there are Koreans out there can guide me, I'm from the UK, but I find, taking into account they are fictional stories but with a sense of how your culture is coming across to a westerner, alittle proud, sometimes harsh, humourous (a bit like ours) and seem to go by honour. Going back to this drama, for me thought the way the step daughter was treated in the end was quite harsh, a bit of compassion wouldn't have come amiss. Mother was a nightmare so can understand the characters turning against her. Was disappointed the daughter didn't end up with the restaurant guy, he's so sweet and lovely. The grandson's character was not very attractive at all, in real life he'd be someone I wouldn't touch with a bargepole! Lol. Well acted by everyone.", "Shining Inheritance was a riches to rags to find-yourself drama that was well written and acted. Our heroine is plucky, the stepmother / stepdaughter are quite the evil pair and our male leads, the rich heir (starts spoiled and evolves) and selfless friend, are both worthy of love. The Grandmother, who has the inheritance, shakes up her sheltered spoiled family when she strips them of money to teach them about life. What I liked about the show a) writer So Hyun-kyung crafted 28 episodes of interwoven characters with surprises along the way. His evil characters had nuances. He also wrote the top-notch intriguing 49 Days (2011 kdrama) that I rate as better than Shining Inheritance. b) male lead Lee Seung-gi as heir Hwan, in his first male lead role, whose evolution from spoiled heir to caring person was a joy to watch. I also loved him as the male lead in 2010's My Girlfriend is Gumiho. c) Yeon Joon-seok as autistic brother Go Eun-woo was perfect and you rooted for him to be reunited with big sister. d) loved store Manager Lee who was terse but fair and put up with Hwan's initially hostile reluctance to do his job with patient dignity.What I did not like about the show a) this drama was extended by 4 episodes and you can feel the storyline stretch. I bet is difficult for a writer to revamp during production when a drama is extended because it is garnering great ratings. b) the evil stepmother, while nuanced, grated on me and I tended to skip her scenes to alleviate the irritation. c) multiple hairstyle-challenged characters; female lead Go Eun-sung mushroom cap pageboy hair bugged me. She looked so much better with the bangs off the face. The Grandmother character had a terrible helmet-head gray wig and don't get me started on the factory worker with the gray pageboy wig.", "I enjoyed Brilliant Legacy aka Shining Inheritance very much. It's from 2009 and features a great cast and interesting story. It is available to watch with English subtitles on Instant Netflix.The actor who plays the autistic teen brother was the highlight for me in this series. He was brilliant at showing the inner world of autism. If you have a family member with autism you will definitely be touched by his storyline.The music soundtrack is perfect for this series. I wish American television could produce something as inspiring and compelling as Shining Inheritance or other top-notch K-dramas I have watched, like I'm Sorry, I Love You, 49 Days, Autumn Sonata, etc. All we ever get are boring reality shows."], "959": [], "960": ["Maybe I should have given it an 8.\nBut I'll stick with 7.\nIt has a serial killer in it, but it's not about a serial killer. In a way he/she is the least important character.\nThe acting is okay, nothing outstanding.\nThe interplay between the characters is the most interesting thing,"], "961": [], "962": [], "963": [], "964": [], "965": [], "966": ["Dream High is a 2011 K-Drama based around the lives of a group of students at a performing arts school. It's basically a musically themed melodrama about some young people.SPOILERS AHEAD!The story centers on the prestigious Kirin Arts Academy; a school devoted entirely to taking young talented performers and turning them into future star musicians, dancers, singers, etc. It's not easy getting into this school, but if you do, you'll be trained night and day to realize your potential.Enter our young aspiring artists. They come from differing backgrounds with varying experience and talents. They all try out to be accepted by the school; some make the cut and some don't for various reasons. One girl that fails to get accepted is given a chance to earn a special exception if she can bring in a couple of other students one of the teachers wants to train. Everybody soon converges together, and the story quickly focuses on the 6 young primary characters; 3 girls and 3 boys, some of which have made the cut, and some of which are trying to get in through the back door.The characters are forced to get to know each other, and have to work together to accomplish their goals (or work against each other as is sometimes the case). Some grow in life over time as individuals, others fall prey to the emotional pitfalls of success and failure. Along the way, some friendships are born and others are crushed, romantic interests are explored, and so forth. This is all very typical stuff for this type of genre, and, it's done competently enough to be a solid melodrama all on its own. All this is set against the backdrop of their individual talents & the arts school though, and, that is where the show really shines.Prior to watching this show, I already was aware that the 6 lead characters were actually fairly accomplished young musicians, dancers, and/or singers, in real life. There's a number of musical set pieces and performances throughout the show, and the 6 leads had no problem delivering the goods in that aspect when called upon. Actually, I was much more concerned if these people could really act, than I was worried they'd be able to pull off the musical numbers. Amazingly, they're all more than acceptable actors and actresses in their specific roles, and some of them gave quite good performances in regards. Overall: Fantastic Job Everyone!I wouldn't actually classify this show as a musical; there are only but a few song & dance numbers (if that many) that spontaneously break out. Almost all of the musical performances are done within the context of story (i.e. during practice, stage events, try-outs, scheduled performances, etc). There's also only a handful of instances of one of the cast members singing to another one, but that's about it. The way the musical performances are incorporated makes for real nice blend to the overall story. Neither part of these differing show aspects interferes with, or outweighs, the other; this is an important part in making this show work successfully as a whole, and, it was all handled with a good deal of aplomb throughout.There's a number of other secondary characters and story lines during this show's 16 episode run. Other artists come and go as guest stars, the school and teachers are focused on some, people's lives and families are looked at, etc. It's mostly all serviceably to effectively accomplished.What could be improved here?...not much (if anything). Asking to tone down the melodrama a bit is just not going to happen with these KTV shows, so deal with it. I suppose the production company could spring for some space heaters for everybody on the set of a winter time KTV show in order to keep their young stars from freezing to death.Bottom Line: This show is definitely geared towards a younger audience than I, but that didn't stop me from liking it anyway, and, I liked it a lot actually. It's enjoyable, and, it is quite good overall. The cast and crew of Dream High II has certainly got their work cut out for them if they want to be on par with this show.8 out of 10 stars!...Well Recommended!", "I loved this K-drama about high school kids pursuing their artistic dreams, and I'm a 55 year old woman! The soundtrack was awesome, and toe tapping, good for dancing! I even bought the CD on Amazon. Dream High was on Streaming Netflix but for some unknown reason they recently removed it. I am so glad I got to enjoy it before it was taken off! You can still see it on the DramaFever website but it's not as much fun when watching on a computer instead of a 60 inch HDTV - plus unless you pay monthly on that site to take the ads off you are interrupted with them on DramaFever every ten minutes. Annoying!I particularly enjoyed the story of the fat girl who lost weight in order to be taken seriously by her peers. Her transformation was beautiful.The boy I liked the best ended up winning the girl in the end, but that was hard because the other boy was very nice too. I felt sorry for his character, he was obviously still in love with her.Apparently there is a Dream High 2 sequel but none of the same cast returned so I will not be bothering with that one. I am not sure why they bother doing that -- bring back the same cast whom people felt close to the first time around.", "I'm not good in writing reviews, but this dorama was brilliant so I decided to write something about it.First of all - the plot is good, the casting is BRILLIANT - all the characters fit their roles for 100%, the music is very-very good, performance, makeup and costumes are good too. Thus all this in a bunch makes this dorama really exciting. Honestly, I see this 'sitcom'- dorama as the best in the line of all the musical series, I've seen in my life (I'm nearly 41, thus I have some experience in it :)) THE STORY: It's a story about 6 students of Kirin High School of Art in Seul - the school for pop talents - dancers, singers, composers. It starts from showing a girl (Go Hye Mi) singing opera on a stage. Next, we see shy girl (Yoon Baek Hee), acting like a Hye Mi's fan. She's Hye Mi's admirer and friend. Later it appears, Hye Mi's father went bankrupt and run away of the country, owing some money to mafia. Mafia tries to get the money from Hye Mi and this brings her from the way of opera singer to the Kirin school. Next we see Hye Mi's teachers (Kang Oh Hyuk, Shi Kyung Jin). Also we see future Hye Mi's friends - violent Jin Gook, country man Song Sam Dong, cool dancer Jason and strange person in a sushi costume (Kim Pil Sook). Hye Mi and Baek Hee will try to pass the entrance exams to Kirin school. Hye Mi will fail, but the school principal will open a special class for the students (and a teacher), who, by his opinion, worth something. Thus it is just the beginning of the story.Try to get it and see by your own eyes :)", "\"Dream High\" is a captivating musical drama that focused a group of young students of Kirin High School and their passionate journey through music to fulfill their dreams overcoming all the haphazard of life under the guidance of some motivating teachers. And the drama was simply moving and touching in many senses with fantastic music score. Some plot holes can be overlooked being mesmerized by the realistic plot line and natural acting. From the third episode, I really got into the drama and it was overall so interesting and heart-warming. Tough but emotional character Go-Hye Mi (the then newbie actress Suzy Bae quietly succeeded in turning out the main character, she's an awesome singer too), her follower friend Yoon Baek Hee, fatty but cutely Kim Pil Suk (IU) (both of their transformation are quite interesting),helpful and caring guy Jin Guk (Taecyeon was so lovely and matured in that role), music prodigy country boy Song Sam Dong ( cool alien Do Min Joon of \"My Love from the Star\" was a way too crazy!), , handsome Jason, inspirational guide - teacher Kang and also the other supporting characters were touching at least for some moments . At some times, the plot seems to get too melodramatic but I enjoyed the drama till the special concert whole-heartedly. It was an attractive display of modern Korean music and dance too. \"Nan kkumi issoyo. Khu kkum-eul midoyo\" ( I have a dream. I believe in that dream)- then hard effort is imperative to fulfill any great dream. We can be in ease in handling difficult situations just by smiling at fears. A good teacher is like a light house. In ups and downs of life, family and friend support can turn out to be a great relief. And after taking a decision, don't regret over it, you've a chance to prove it the best!- these inner morals of this drama are easy to say, tough to implement in real life but obviously these have made the drama ultimately inspirational , moving and memorable . Just to mention, I watched the impressive first season only and don't have any wish to watch the second season with totally different cast. :)", "I am not used to watch Asian dramas, I'm from Brazil and all I'm used are the TV shows from my country and some from Europe and the USA.But I got curious to check a little more about a foreign country from the other side of the world.When I first read some thoughts about this show I was expecting a story about six teenagers going into some trouble to get into an art school. But it goes far far away from that, in the very beginning I got a little upset about how things were taking place...But in the middle things started to be clearer and I can say for sure it is not only about six young dreams coming true, but it is the path they follow with the help of their family, friends and teachers.Yes, for me, the main plot of this TV show were the teachers, the students starts to follow what they believe and things happens not as we like in the middle, but as soon as it gets to the end you start to realize the values involved in everything.I am fascinated about what I just watched, I never wrote a review before because nothing has really touched me like I felt right now when I saw the ending.It is millions of time worth it to watch, you will see some of the Korean society cultures involved, you'll see some dreams coming true, others getting lost in their way, and most important, you'll see people rebuilding their path because they believe it is possible to dream and pursuit the happiness thru the realization of their dream.And I have to confess, everything is sooooo different from what I was used to, like if I'm not wrong, you'll see only four kisses, a very nice ones, very subtle and very beautiful... and you'll see a lot of crying and tears (like those I have right now)... and this is something I don't understand, why so many tears? This is something I don't see in dramas around here, but it might has a strong meaning for Koreans, because it is probably in every single episode.Once again, if you want to get touched, if you want to understand values of life, and of course, if you love music, you have to watch this, I promise, if you're a human being, it will touch you somehow.Enjoy and my best wishes for those who made this drama available."], "967": [], "968": [], "969": [], "970": ["\"Good Morning President\" basically shows the Korean presidency from three points of view. One is about some old guy who is the president of Korea winning the lottery, but having to decide if he should give it up because of a speech of giving money to the needy he made a while back. The other is about a younger president played by Jang Dong-gun dealing with the problem of japan trying to take Dokdo by using the US as a tool. The last one is about a female president having to deal with her trouble making husband, who isn't such a bad guy. The only plot that stood out to me the one with Jang Dong-gun playing the main role as president, I personally think they should have made just one president played by Jang Dong-gun to play the main role throughout the whole film. While adding some more elements of romance between Jang and Han Chae-Young in it, cause Jang Dong-gun's part of the movie was the only entertaining and engaging part of the whole film, all in all it's pretty much a feel good movie.6.8/10", "Bizarre Anthology Film about has 3 separate stories about 3 separate Korean presidents (each one succeeding the last)while being observed and being advised in their various problems by the homespun down home folksy wisdom of the chef of the presidential house For my money--the first story, or half hour of the film's running time was the best and the brightest--and crazy enough that i wish the entire film was devoted to it quite honestly. Picture this as a movie plot line--PRESIDENT WINS LOTTERY, SCHEMES TO COLLECT WINNINGS WITHOUT GIVING HIS IDENTITY AWAY--sounds like it could either be hilarious or completely stupid right? Its exactly why i liked it so much.There's a hilarious sequence where he actually goes to claim his winnings dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and a tiny fake mustache (which of course begins to peal from his face from the second he gets to the claims window) He then proceeds to get into an argument with a much younger guy in back of him who's getting mad that pops is holding up the line (which of course causes the Pres to ask Do You Know Who I Am? How Dare You Talk To Me Like That!) That one sequence alone is so inspired, so completely silly, so absolutely ridiculous--I swear I laughed for like 10 whole minutes after it was over--it was almost too silly. (i LOVED it!!!) Eventually of course it turns into a moralist tale about how you should do the right thing when you encounter that much luck and money and blah--it was still pretty funny though.The other 2 story lines aren't as silly--although they are pretty engaging and sunny optimistic as well. The 2nd plot line involves a president who while worried about preventing nuclear war between Japan and North Korea manages to re-connect with his great lost love--his former next door neighbor who is now a hard bitten news woman--AND gets propositioned by this guy who simply wants to ask him if he'll donate his kidney to his dying father. Why does this stranger ask the president of all people to donate his kidney? Cause He's The President--And The President Should Help His Countrymen. (that's sound some reasoning--the ending of this segment has a pretty good punchline tho.) The 3rd plot line is that Korea's first female president gets voted into office (defeating the 2nd Pres--i guess he wasn't so popular with his countrymen after all.) and her husband who's a guy who likes to get his drink on with his buddies causes embarrassment and ultimately asks for a divorce cause he can't stand being followed around everywhere by the secret service agents while he just wants to hang around and get drunk with his friends. (There's a good scene here where he and his friends drunkenly go to the gates of the Korean president house where they taunt the secret service agents---one of his friends is constantly referred to as Optimus Prime--and when Optimus Prime starts to drunkenly pee on one of the agents--the agent claims that they are under attack from Optimus Prime!) The film then becomes about whether its OK for a leader to also act as a spurned lover and beg her husband to come back because she actually loves him.That former question--Can A Leader Act Silly And Goofy And Still Be Taken Seriously As A Leader seems to be the main theme of the film---What Undermimes A Leader With His People? And its a good premise for a film--certainly one that hasn't been done a thousand times already--especially in this age where every gaffe and every misquote and every misdeed is recorded instantly and endlessly commented on by everyone in the universe within a matter of hours (if not minutes) The film however as sweet and as playful as it is---the synopsis for it in the festival i saw it as part of listed it as \"Capraesque\" (but \"Tatiesque\" would be a more apt description.)it may be too slight to really go for the gusto in answering these questions. Personally i think the movie should've gone even more into surrealism or absurdest situations as the attempts to ground the movie in seriousness with the whole north Korean/Japanese business only serves to undermine the film's message that a good leader can't (or shouldn't) be undermined by silliness. The film is quite entertaining however---even if it is ultimately more corny and more sweet then it is gut bouncingly funny even if that president having the winning lottery ticket scenario of the first plotting is just awesomely silly and sweetly goofy in just the right combo that i hated to see it replaced by a different plot line!"], "971": ["Athena: Goddess of War is a Korean action melodrama show that was spun off from the hugely successful \"Iris\" series. This show basically ramps up the same action and intrigue found in \"Iris\", but, it does so at the expense of providing the central dramatic themes that made \"Iris\" the more interesting and addictive of the 2 shows.SPOILERS AHEAD!I did not like this show as near as much as its predecessor, but I did still enjoy watching it. It only very loosely follows the events that occurred in the \"Iris\" series, and you don't really need to watch that show first in order to watch this one. Although, there are a couple of crossover characters involved that might make you scratch your head for a couple of episodes as to who they are if you did not watch \"Iris\" first. These \"Iris\" characters just got in the way here for the most part, and they did not need to be incorporated (somewhat clumsily, I might add) into this show.Frankly, this show would have been better off it if had distanced itself from being an \"Iris\" spin off in my opinion. It's not a bad stand alone action show on its own, that would have likely been much better thought of without all the inherent direct comparisons to some other show.This show gets off to a blazing start action wise, and it doesn't waste any time letting you know what you're in for. In the intro, 2 teams of secret agents are pitted against each other as they battle over a nuclear scientist who defected. Once that's wrapped up, they flash forward a bit, where various new crises are implemented by the baddies over time, while the good guys try to stop them. That's basically it!As with \"Iris\", there are a number of organizations and persons involved that are good, bad, gray, or undecided. They add a few more organizational & personal angles in this show though (which were mostly redundant); this is not confusing per se, but it only serves to unnecessarily try to complicate the plot with very little benefit to the overall story. This show is by no means bad, particularly so if you're looking for an action series. There are a number of action scenes (several of which are quite impressive), and, the acting, production values, etc, are all above average. However, it lacks an underlying story with enough purpose to bring the entire production together to deem it a must watch show.; it ultimately just follows a continuing pattern of: intrigue plot scene, action set piece scene, romance plot scene, then repeat.It's decent enough to recommend as it does more than enough quite well. The first 8 episodes or so were, indeed, highly entertaining. This show gets bogged down quite a bit once the primary plot kicks in though. There's plenty enough talent and money involved to make it all work, and there are only a very few episodes that are poorly written, directed, or produced. I think where it fails a bit is a result of what seems to have been rush to capitalize on \"Iris\". This show would have been much better served if the writers and story tellers were given some more time to think things through in advance, but that's the way it goes sometimes!Bottom Line: Somewhere in the 6-8 star range. It's mostly watchable (even more so if you're just looking for some KTV action). I'm giving it 7 stars!", "An agent (Woo-sung Jung) is transferred to the National Anti-Terrorist Service and must stop a secret organization from committing acts of terror. This series (20 episodes, 60 minutes each) is a spin-off of the \"Iris\" series (with different actors) and is similar in terms of its budget, high production values, and slick presentation. The difference, however, is that the first few episodes set things up as a brainless, high octane action flick with generic scriptwriting, bland scoring, and weak characters. It severely lacks the dramatic intensity that made \"Iris\" so addictive, but the major positive here is the action, which provides some excellent shootouts that are on par with (or even better than) most theatrical films. It's amazing what they did with a mere $17 million. Soo Ae and Ji-ah Lee provide some exciting \"girls with guns\" action early on, but grow passive afterward, which is kinda disappointing. The pacing is blistering fast thru the first 10 episodes but runs out of gas during the second 10 episodes when the action becomes sparse and of a much lesser quality. It's almost like the director got lazy and phoned it in, because things actually get pretty damn boring at times. This would have been awesome if it had ended after episode 10.", "Whose who of Korean dramas and films are featured here-some aging stars, some pretty stars, some mediocre stars and some rising stars. But only one truly shines and that was Cha Seung Won who played the super villain Son Hyuk. Not only does he have a menacing voice, but he runs and shoots his gun like a true villain. It is a great portrayal-intelligent, witty and charismatic. Jung Woo Sung plays the quiet gentle NTS agent who is the main character and the hero. He does not quite match up to Cha Seung Won's magnetism. A hero role can be rather bland at times and it maybe the hardest role to play for an actor. A hero role requires a bit more imagination and passion. While watching Athena: Goddess of War, I couldn't help but be on Son Hyuk's side. Even with all his evil villainy, he made the scenes captivating and worth watching.", "Disappointing spin off of the ground breaking IRIS. South Korean security branch, NTS, squares off against international energy terrorist cabal. Poorly acted, wrong headed direction, and a script with more holes than a rat infested wheel of Swiss cheese. The main lead is too young, and early on grins and mugs as if auditioning for teen boy band. A team captain is inept and foolish, as is a North Korean ex-elite agent. Don't get me started on the bane of K-dramas. The tears. Weeping, crying, sobbing like six year olds. Yet these blubbering basket cases safeguard the nation.There are exceptions, the chief being the Son Hyuk rogue baddie who excels.The director obviously knows action sequences, which are showcases. With actors, he seems clueless. As much as I blame the series director for foolish comic relief and histrionics, however, the main culprit is the ridiculous script. Long, gorgeous episodes in Italy - for no purpose. Two episodes in Japan, guarding a pop star - for no purpose. Double agents exposed, and then the duped side shrugs and says, \"Well, they're sorry, so back to work.\" Initially, the main villains are USA agencies, which is a wonderful twist, only that thread is abandoned.", "I haven't read all the reviews, but I read most of them. So I would say I'm in the minority, when I say that Iprefer this to Iris. The main reasons being, I think it has better characters, and to use words the director of nts uses, it has more light and shade in storyline and acting, The best acting came came from Kim Min-Jong and the actor who the aforementioned employs after in a very funny scene hitting him in the face a number of times. There is a delightful scene between the two of them where they try to gain information by pretending to be who they are not. i also liked Oh Yoon-Ah. This is the third thing I've seen her in, and the more I see her, the more I like her. She is not a great actress. But she is game, and wiling to try different things. She seems to like characters more than lead roles. She reminds me a bit of Cameron Diaz. Looking at her picture on Asianwiki, she looks a lot different. In Iris, a lot of the performances were rather one note. In this drama, at least some of the actors are given a chance to show they can do more than look very very serious. I thought there were some terrific gunfights Yes it has it's faults. There were too many people being saved in the nick of time. who the hell was oh yoon ha talking to on the phone after she had been out drinking with Soo-Ae's character. A major theme of this drama is redemption. Some viewers might not like the fact that a character who they would probably prefer to be killed isn't, and another character who it would have been nice if they had lived doesn't. As regards the plot about the north Korean agent from Iris. There are also some very funny lines in this, mostly coming from the characters i said i like. The director of Nts also said something i found amusing.He says says something about NTs upholding justice, and then says \"you may find that cheesy and boring\" You would never hear the director of homeland security in 24 says something like that.Regarding the special. It reminded me of the what was to me the best action scene, the one between the main villain, and another guy. in the first episode in the bathroom.", "Having watched both IRIS and Athena I felt compelled to write the review for the former mentioned show.Athena has some good action scenes, however some of them feel a bit forced and overdone. How to put it more clearly and bluntly? Some of them feel too unrealistic and you have a feeling that it is too fictitious and not believable. Same thing was present in IRIS but in much less quantity.Next minus is the suspense. Instead of a flowing story arc there are subplots which don't fit so well one after another. They are not so compact. The transition itself is good, but after it ends you feel like it had no big impact on the story as a whole (I am referring to episodes 3 to 5).The last great flaw is the drama, which in the absence of better description from my part is not up to par (not satisfying enough), it lacks more storytelling and exploration. The kind that was done well in its sister show IRIS.However there are some pleasant surprises in this show and the end does have closure, although the last 10 episodes are somewhat dragged out when it comes to storytelling.All in all I found Athena as a good, solid show which lacks some pace, suspense and more deeper drama but it makes up for it in a good measure of action, acting and immersion into its world."], "972": ["Chul-ki is released from prison, and begins a ruthless quest of vengeance, working his way up a group of gangsters toward his main targets, Axe and Ghost-face. Slowly throughout the film, we learn the reasons behind his quest for revenge. He encounters a young girl, Tae-Yeon, who has her own reasons for wanting revenge against the gangsters.It was a pretty good film, moving at a good pace and did not overstay its welcome at a brief 89 minutes. The settings were interesting and matched the bleak and violent story line, from an abandoned apartment block, to an old factory, to an stark quarry.

The two meet and he begins to soon fall for her. She's less than impressed with him though, so he's got his work cut out for him. The tried and true staple of K-drama loves stories is on full display here; he's constantly presented with a series of arranged dates to meet a future wife from the same ilk as his own family, but he's not interested in this and wants to find his own love. His stature and eligibility means he pursued by an endless supply of suitable beauties, so his ego is a bit unchecked in regards to what a great catch he thinks he is. As such, he is somewhat baffled by the fact that this \"lower class\" girl doesn't jump at the chance to be with him, couldn't care less about his standing, and won't give him the time of day. He's also never met any woman quite like this before in his life, and she's pretty easy to look at, so he's more than intrigued/smitten/determined/etc. He therefore decides to use his power and wealth to intrude in her life in order to win her over, which initially backfires of course, until perhaps the 2 can eventually find some common ground to stand on if this relationship was \"meant to be\".We're rolling right along with the standard fare for this genre over the first half dozen episodes or so; it's workable and kept fairly tight for the most part as the two leads come together bit by bit. It's all pretty much par for the course, then, BAM (SPOILERS); on a mountain biking date one day, the 2 stray off course and stumble upon a strange old shop & restaurant in the middle of nowhere. While there, they imbibe a magical potion which causes their souls to switch bodies. As such, a whole new layer to the proceedings then comes into play in this series.While this wacky \"out of nowhere\" plot aspect of the show may seem absurd (and it is, of course), it does actually work, and, it works quite well. It both helps to break up the status quo for a typical K-drama, and, also serves to further benefit the story as well as a whole. These two characters were having a hard time developing a common ground & relationship the old fashioned way, so perhaps they will find love via this mystical method instead. Accordingly, the two opposites come to understand and appreciate each other more by spending time in each other's body/life.The twist provides for a great deal of comedy to be mined here, as the CEO dude now has to lead the life of the poor tough girl, and stunt woman girl has to run a company and be subjected to high society pressures. While they've switched bodies, they also each take the opportunity to investigate the other, turn away the other's potential love interests, see each other's friends and siblings half naked, etc. It's all pretty cute. This is not without problems though, as each time it rains, the bodies are switched back and forth; so, there's a chance he might get caught in her body while trying to perform a risky stunt that he's ill prepared for, or she does something unknowingly that puts him in danger due to his health problems, etc.Eventually, the two leads get down to the business of trying to figure out how to stop switching bodies all the time, so they can get back to their normal lives before somebody finds out or something goes horribly wrong. With some help from their friends and family, and with a little luck, perhaps all will work out in the end, and maybe the two leads will be able to find love along the way. The cast all put in acceptable to solid work, and just about all characters are likable enough. Perhaps the best role is that of the CEO's brother; a K-pop star known as Oska, who leads a mostly carefree life of luxury when he's not lamenting the loss of his true love that got away. The stunt woman has a huge fan crush on him that comically belies her no nonsense tough girl persona, to the point of her being elated with scoring concert tickets, sleeping in Oska themed socks, etc. And, though Oska competes with his brother to some degree, he mostly serves as an intermediary for the two leads while they work on their budding romance.All in all, this show is pretty solid. It doesn't go on forever (though it could have been trimmed a little), and it's kept pretty lighthearted for the most part; it's mostly a charming comedy-romance-drama, with little heavy handed \"evil plot/villain schemes\". Be prepared for a melodramatic final act though, as this is Korean melodrama after all.Bottom Line: 7-8 out of 10 stars. I'll give it an 8!", "I am so happy to come across this show. I was so bored of sex, violence and drama and then, I found Secret Garden. This show gives you love in its purest form as possible. When I watch it, I can feel butterflies flying in my stomach one minute , then the tears roll down on my cheeks and a broad smile occupy my face at the end of each show. Characters are well put, funny and deep. You can feel and understand what they are going through. Story line is enhanced with side stories and never boring. The cinematography is breath taking, like most of far eastern movies the scenery brings forth the emotions. To sum up, please give this show a try, I am sure you ll be hooked :)", "I really didn't think I would like this drama. I watched Boys Over Flowers and ended up really disliking the whole series because I couldn't get over how unlikeable some of the characters were. When I started Secret Garden, I thought \"Oh great another story about a bratty rich guy who traumatizes his girlfriend into liking him... I bet the female lead looks like she's strong and then becomes a blubbering wimp or insensitive ice queen.\" I could have not been MORE WRONG. OK some may watch episode one and say...well sure looks like it to me! ...but it's not. This is how BoF should have tackled the rich boy/poor girl love story.OK to be fair I was not a big Joo Won fan for most of the series (His character alone made me question the series as a whole). Surprisingly the one who enchanted me was Gil Ra Im, and the adorable Oska! <3 I stuck with the series because it was refreshing to see the leading lady bite back when Joo Won was being a jerk. When he hurt her she would tell him, and she never gave in to his sharp remarks, and eventually Joo Won realized the power of his own words and slowly opened himself to loving her. When you fall in love and root for a character you once disliked, that's the power of great story telling. What is more amazing about this drama, even though it followed some typical Kdrama conventions it did so in a way that you were surprised and shocked that they worked in some big revelations. It brought out the true meaning of 'destiny' and it made the series as a whole more heartfelt and touching.The switching bodies theme...I thought \"eeeeeeh this will be needless and over the top\" but it was really well done! At first it took some getting used to, but it actually made for some of the more touching moments in the story, and the funniest. Joo Won swooning over Oska made me laugh to tears. Lastly, I find one of the biggest faults with many dramas is the story always feels like it tapered off without thought at the very end. I loved that Secret Garden tied up all the loose ends in the most touching of ways. It felt complete to me, and it made me feel like the love experienced in the stories was true and sincere.Overall, those of you who watch the first couple of episodes and are not impressed, I say stick with it! You'll be glad you did. All the characters are wonderful to watch and develop into three-dimensional people that you'll root for and cheer on! It's a fantastic love story that makes you want to find your soulmate. :D", "Every time I watch a show from Korea, I am never disappointed. This one is no different. An emotional roller coaster show with fantastic characters, beautiful cinematography and amazing soundtrack. You will fall in love with the show and its characters. The script is well written and the actors and actresses have such chemistry.You will find yourself laughing, crying, smiling and being angry right along with them.A word of caution though. You will find yourself wanting to start the next episode once you reach the end of the one you are watching because it is that good and addicting. I was sad that I got to the last episode and it ended. So, I started watching from the first episode again. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.", "The title head pretty much described it all, with such unique story line of modern fairy tale and the harsh reality, it was sure hardcore for everyone who watched the whole series. They have deviated from the usual KDrama style, plot and conflicts. It is fantasy by the way, but the great thing is that it was not greatly emphasized in the early episodes (the switching part). They did not spend most of the time in different bodies, in contrast to what others would have expected. Sure it was fun to watch the actors played so well but in the latter part it played a big role in story development and made the story what it is: destiny, love, magic and everything else in between.More on the deviating from usual KDrama trend, let's go to love triangles. Pretty much empty, for the first part again I expected Oska and Yoon Seul to be big third parties in the rel. of the main characters (just like in Full House) but again wasn't interesting anymore. Another thing is the conflict between Joo Won's mother. I thought it would be another main conflict but the theme of the story prevailed : Love conquers all! I would also like to commend the writer for such great plot. I love that she did not revealed everything in the first parts, opposed to many KDramas that tells the social status of both protagonists, family background and conflicts at the start of the story. If it had been like that, it would not make the story interesting (I was really guessing what could have happened to Ra Im's father, or Joo Won's life-changing accident, nor how the Oska-Yoon Seul bitterly ended) .It was obviously not a character-driven plot, it was more on what's going to happen to Gil Ra Im and Joo Won next that would help clarify the past.There were many metaphors, symbols and recurring themes (eg little mermaid) and if you had not appreciated this series, I say you missed it. Clearly, it was a work of a genius to think of such great script and plot.Another common mistakes of Kdramas is that you would end up loving the actors because of empty reasons. Secret Garden got me so hooked up to Gil Ra Im and Joo Won that i did not bother searching their names in Google when i was watching the series (I only did that after finishing the series). Their undeniable chemistry would sure fire up the intensity of the key plots, making them effective actors. BOTTOMLINE: I fell in love with the characters! Not with the actors !The ending was absolutely perfect. It wasn't a fairy tale like ending. Ra Im did not turn into Cinderella, nor Joo Won into Prince Charming. In the end, it was their love that prevailed amidst imperfections in their relationship and differences. Finishing the story with the lines, \"We still don't have a single wedding picture, but we fall in love every single day, like living a magical life\". That's what I true magic brings into our lives: blissful love beyond imperfectionsThe story itself was well-written, plot was well-thought, the casting and the chemistry of the actors have pretty much set the tone for the success of the series. This may sound biased but overall i say this is the BEST KOREAN Drama i have seen in years, and I would be sure there won't be any KDRAMAS that will be as good as this in the coming years.", "I much enjoy a romantic melodrama in the min-series format that develops a main single story from beginning to end, though with some related parallel sub-plots along the way. The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back. This may recur in the same story.Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved.If personality dynamics are properly depicted in a valid manner, and if the production is skillful, powerful emotions can be evoked in the viewer. In this way we can live many lifetimes through movies, in our one lifetime - greatly enriching our incarnate experience.These South Korean productions (seen on Netflix streaming) are first class with excellent production and direction, some terrific casting and acting (particularly from some of the females who give some matchless world class performances), brilliant musical accompaniment, and staging. What makes these so good is the way they skillfully evoke deep emotion in the viewer. South Korean movie making is superb - world class.However, the following caveats must be considered by the USA viewer: They are subtitled and some people hate this. The South Korean cultural norms, values and sanctions may sometimes seems silly or old fashioned to the USA viewer. The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation/unity - sometimes reminiscence of a old Frank Capra film.Most importantly, in order for the sometimes complicated sub-plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing, and this leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people, that sometimes seem to be unlikely by USA cultural standards. The viewer may wonder at times why good but trusting people are so easily manipulated and deceived by bad and selfish people, but con artists do often succeed (just look at politicians for example). However this poetic license of improbability is needed to develop the story - just accept it as occurring even though unlikely at times. Taking these factors into account will help you become involved and emotionally engrossed. It was hard for me to quit watching at times so I often binged watched more than one episode at a time.I would rank these as follows but tastes differ and your rankings might not agree: 1 - 4 (hard to say which is best)Shining InheritanceWhen a Man LovesThat Winter, The Wind BlowsSecret garden5. Five Fingers6. The Scent of a Woman7. The Great Queen Seondeok8. A Hundred Years Inheritance9. Lie To me10. Roof Top Prince11. Dr. Jin12. The Great DoctorSecret Garden is a romantic comedy as well as melodrama, and interplays the two quite well. We see a transformation in the male lead from a rich, self-centered upper-class snob, unable to love others, into a regular guy ('human' as the South Koreans label it) able to relate emphatically and love. The female lead puts the snob down, even beating him up when he deserves it, which makes for great fun. This theme is also featured in \"Protect the Boss\", another South Korean TV mini-series that is not reviewed by me.", "Secret Garden is delightful with two of Korea's best actors and two of the best writers and directors. It hits all major points in KDrama romance and fantasy but also carries a strong theme about the power of unconditional love. My only quibble is the evil mother figure that becomes a staple in Korean drama. Really tired of it. But everything else I love and have watched the series over through the years-which I never do with American series. Nine years later, I still don't think Hyun Bin has matched that performance. Strongly recommended.", "Very funny, very touching. For the most part, a wonderful screenplay. The chemistry was good between the two leads. Bit then I often find that in these dramas. It had cliches common to korean dramas. But I tend to overlook those. The two leads gave good performances, but there were no real standouts. It made me laugh, smile, cry.", "I'm from the UK so didn't get to see this on Netflix until last year but having enjoyed watching I've just watched again. Love the action and humour between the characters and also the opportunity of viewing Korean culture and scenery. The only criticism I have now watching it the second time around is for me, a bit of chemistry lacking between male and female leads, otherwise, very well acted", "The more familiar you are with Korean/Eastern Asian way of life, the more treasures you find in this drama. Although at first, magic sounds ridiculous as a way to rationalize a Cinderella type story, but in the end that magic does prove to work well in context and make the whole story more logical.Other aspects are good/excellent. However, only 9/10 from me because some parts can still be cut short.", "If you foreign watchers do not know, secret garden is regarded as the classic of romantic drama in korea. This is true also in my place. I agree with one of the commentary here that it has some elements that are different from typical love kdrama, then in turn let secret garden excels other kdramas.The plot is well written. Female lead is a stuntwoman. Scenes of her fighting in movie shooting making her a very special lead. The story ends with the lead couple actually meet each other when young, with Ha's father, a fireman, dead because of saving the life of the young male lead. So, the lead couple meet not just by coincidence but by destiny. This makes the story ends so perfectly.The other thing impress me is the big house of the male lead, beautifully decorated with a large garden that has pond, forest and snowy ground. It is just like a paradise. In fact the house is used in a recent kdrama.It is a seriously made classic that you cannot miss.", "I watched it on 2018 . I can't step out of the fantasy. Its like these characters are real. The story is not only about the eternal love between two persons with huge differences but it also gives the message that fate can change everything. The actors were outstanding. The body swap didn't impress me but the acting made it even. The climax is the most heartouching. The BGM played a major role in empathising with the characters.", "Unexpectedly, Secret Garden is quite entertaining. Sure, the story and the romance wasn't the best of the best, and the performances were so so, but still I can understand why this drama is so popular. First of all, the drama is about a rich, cynical CEO who meets a poor stand woman who gets his interest. Their lives get even more complicated, when they magically change bodies. Oaky, the magic part wasn't that good. It was a little childish at first, but it had a not-that-great explanation in the end. And the body exchange was very entertaining the first time, but the second time was just uncomfortable. The main male character was very funny, due to his character, and in the end, that was the only thing supporting the drama. For me, the twenty episodes were a bit too much; the story could have easily finish at the sixteenth or the eighteenth episode, and still, it would have been as good, as the final episode was a quick wrap up mixed up with a few concert songs, some flash backs and family life moments. So, 6 out of 10.", "SPOILERS !!! 1- It's not funny, I hardly ever laughed. Part of it could be poor subtitles, but you don't need those for physical comedy, and there's precious little of that.2- The main premise of the body swap, which offered unlimited possibilities, is terribly underutilized.3- Characters do not behave in a realistic way, for example we are asked to believe that while swapped they aren't curious about their new bodies. Also why pretend they don't feel any kind of sexual impulse? If the creators didn't want them to have sex before marriage they could have found some perfectly good excuse.4- How and why the female lead, from the original distaste for him, comes to love the male lead, is poorly explained, we are left to assume she gets tired of him insisting so much and gives in.5- The story arc of the sidekick couple, even in its simplicity, is a lot more interesting than the protagonists' one.6- While the bodies are swapped they are sometimes showed as un-swapped (for the viewer benefit I guess?) but this only causes confusion and negates the premise.7- The main actress shows good acting skills when she does a man in a woman's body, but below average ones otherwise.8- The two most important conflicts (the difficult love stories of the two couples) are resolved too soon, so the final episode lacks any punch and is reduced to some 50 minutes of happy ending, which is way too many.9- The evil mother thing is overdone.10- The sister of the main character is first introduced and then completely forgotten about.11- Other characters which either had the potential for an interesting sub-plot (the gay musician) or were genuinely funny (the assistant of the department store director Park) were underdeveloped/underutilized.12- To an extent this is to be expected in most TV shows, but when it comes to Secret Garden there are way too many plot holes and inconsistencies.13- For a series produced in 2010, there are too many K-drama stereotypes: rich boy/poor girl, evil mother, sidekick couple, hospital\u0085 we've seen this for a decade now. Still it would be OK if at least it was well done, but it isn't.The series by which I jusge all others is \"Kim Sam-soon\" which, with all the limitations inherent to a family TV program / k drama, is funny, realistic enough, not too syrupy, and sports the best female lead character in the history of television.That show set the standard for rom-coms, and therefore we can expect it to be copied a lot, but Secret Garden went to far: - same actor in the male lead role - in both shows there's a trip to Jeju island - in both shows the male lead had a life threatening accident when younger - said accident left the male lead unable to ride a transport (car/elevator)", "This drama indeed is depicting a different male main character of the usual Korean drama, on this drama Hyun Bin acting cold-hearted, speak straight forwardly but also arrogant and loving at the same time. Ha Ji Won acting as a rather weak female character who pretended to be strong but needed to be loved and taking care of. These 2 characters across their paths and with quite boring some arguments they managed to fall in love and charmed by each other. Don't really get into this drama at 1st but the funniest part is when at 1st they changed souls into their bodies, the 2nd one is predictable of how the story goes on, 3rd one rather sad and I almost cried of how sad it could be. Overall it's a happy ending but without the approval of Hyun Bin's mom and she's being stubborn and hateful till the end. The soundtrack is nice an enjoyable. I don't quite say that it's a good drama, but this one is not bad to killing time. The acting of both the main actors are not that great and quite ordinary may be they could put more effort to bring different characters.", "I waited for the series to end in GMA 7 before making this review. I watched the original Korean series with English subtitle but I didn't enjoy it. I don't know if it was the actor's or actress's voice or the subtitle but I really didn't find the series appealing. So when I saw the teaser from GMA 7 a few months back, I decided to give it another try. I watched Hyun Bin from the series My Name is Kim Sam Soon and I love him ever since. That's why watching it twice was not a bad idea.I wasn't disappointed. I liked the way the Filipinos dubbed the series. The \"kalye\" language they used was very appropriate for our culture and made the series more natural. I definitely love the \"saltik\" term Jamie used to call Owen. It became an endearment. (How was that possible? You should watch the tagalized series.)Secret Garden was one of the most popular drama series to hit mainstream Korea. It has high ratings and continued to be on top of the charts till the last episode. I won't argue with that. It was really funny. I understand why the Koreans loved it because after watching the tagalized version, I fell in love with it too. I thought that the series was like a Korean remake of the movie It's a Boy Girl Thing (2006). I'm not saying it was the same but I think the concept was derived from this movie. The Koreans just expanded the concept and made the story suitable for Asian audiences.Hyun Bin's portrayal of Owen's character was very smooth but I was more amazed with Hyun Bin's acting when the swapping of bodies occurred. He has to act as Jamie and that basically requires him to act like a girl\u2014 he was very effective. The change in characters was drastic but Hyun Bin pulled it off. It was not awkward. The acting was very natural. And as a viewer, I believed that Jamie's soul was in Owen's body.On the other hand, Hai Ji Won's acting may not be impressive but she improved very well since she started in the business. I first had a glimpse of her acting prowess in the movie 100 Days with Mr. Arrogant and she was not good. I found her acting in that movie very novice but that would be in another review. I don't think there's much difference from her Jamie-self and Owen-acting when the switched occurred. She already has as strong, tomboyish character at the beginning of the series, so I didn't find it exceptional.The series in general was slow-paced. I understand that they wanted to build the characters in the first ten episodes to make the viewers acquainted with their attitudes so by the time the swap happens, the viewers will easily see the changes. However, I was bored to death waiting for the swap to happen. This was supposedly the core of the series. Why haven't they shown it yet? When it finally did, instead of feeling ecstatic, I was relieved. At long last, the moment I've been waiting for took place.Hey, wait up! It's not all negative. There are a couple of things I love from the series.First, Owen's trademark track suit. That sequenced blue track suit was probably the most popular item ever copied and mass-produced in Korea. It looks funny in Owen but it looks adorable in Hyun Bin. (The analogy is difficult to explain. Ha-ha)Second, the unexpected kiss between Owen (with Jamie's soul) and his cousin Oska (Yoon Sang Hyun). I find that scene remarkable! I can't forget it. I know Hyun Bin was acting Jamie's character but still in reality he is who he is and Oksa is Yoon Sang Hyun and they shared a kiss?! I can't take that off my mind for a few days.And last of all, Owen's attitude with love. If there's a guy out there like him, pwede akin ka na lang? (Can you please be mine?) He fought for what he wanted. He didn't give up on love. Even if Jamie threw him out, physically and emotionally hurt him\u2014he stayed. He showed the cold, afraid and aloof Jamie what it means to love and be loved."], "978": [], "979": ["I haven't seen too much korean dramas so far (like 10, or so), but if I should name the cutest one all of them, I would say it is Mary stayed out all night. It's a really lightsome, funny story, there were a lot of scenes I found really hilarious. The actors did all good job, I would recommend definitely this drama for all Jang Keun-suk fans, he portrayed a cool, grumpy, yet sensitive rockstar - I think a character like this fits him the most. The soundtrack was okay as well, except one song (\"My precious\") which I found pretty annoying after a while, but that's the only negative thing I can mention about this dorama. This series consists only 16 episodes, so it's not long at all, but perfectly enough for a story like this. If you are looking for a delightful and addictive korean drama, give a chance to this one!", "this series has it all the dashing and charismatic JKS-he portrays the character way too well his ost for this series are superb we have moon geun young's innocence and she is obviously pretty t the best part about this drama was every character has some sort of bonding with the other ,which makes the series quite dynamic ,funny and worth adoring. watched it quite a many times already and all the jang geun suk's fan you will get to see some adorable kisses. also most of the dramas are rich boy poor girl type but it is not the case here. this series have many scenes where games are played amongst friends who are truly happy go lucky which will be fun to watch."], "980": [], "981": [], "982": ["I am a huge fan of the Korean historical epics and this one is good but not as good as some of the others I have seen.If you haven't seen any of the others, don't make this your first. Check out Kingdom of wind, Chumong, warrior Baek dong Su and the tree with deep roots. If you have seen a bunch of them and are looking for more, this is worth the time.It tells the story of the rise of the most famous king of Baekje. Baekje was one of the three kingdoms of Korea around 2000 years ago. He transformed them from a small state to a serious player as he attempted to subjugate his neighbors and unify his country. The show takes a long time to get going but once it does, it is enjoyable enough. The casting is a little off in my opinion. The main character is a short fat guy, not what you normally expect for the story's hero. Not that it is massively important but the attention to detail is a little off too. The soldiers armor has noticeable plastic clips a few thousand years before plastic and injection molding were invented. Still, this is better than any of the American made historical epics and any criticism is only because the other Korean shows set the bar so high. The American made Show Marco Polo, for example, was a disgrace in comparison to this. Check it out if you are a fan of this genre. Probably not one with universal appeal IMO."], "983": [], "984": [], "985": [], "986": [], "987": [], "988": [], "989": [], "990": [], "991": [], "992": [], "993": ["Fugitive Plan B is a Korean TV series that just plain sucks.SPOILERS AHEAD!I don't know why I bothered with this show as I could tell it was going to suck soon after I began watching it, but I finished all of it out somehow!...Please don't watch it...you will regret it if you do. I will now commence with my review of this series, and will consider my worldwide community service done for a little while. Story; Private Investigator is hired by a young heiress to find out who killed her family. While investigating, they discover her family left behind some hidden gold that an evil organization is trying to find. Meanwhile, there's a cop who's chasing the PI as the PI is apparently also a wanted criminal. There's a bunch of side characters and sub plots tossed in along the way, and everybody involved eventually tries to find the gold while trying to either capture someone, kill someone, or turn someone into the authorities. It can mostly be considered as an Action-Drama.The main problem with this show is that it is both ill conceived and poorly written. It's basically: plot point, fight scene, plot point, chase scene, plot point, repeat ad nauseam. While this may sound like it might be exciting, it most decidedly is not; in fact, it's downright boring. The majority of the fight and chase scenes don't carry any suspense as no one ever seems to get hurt, and if someone gets caught, they just escape in the very next scene anyway. It appears they only had part time makeup artists on set as well, as half the time everybody escapes from a big fight without a single blemish, but are bleeding profusely from the next big fight at other times.There are also many attempts at comedy throughout that fall flat unless you're a 6 year old. Contrary to what the writers may think, it's not hilarious to see Rain get his ass stuck in some lady's face during car chase scene # 143. There's also a side character who's another PI in Thailand or the Philippines or somewhere; his name is James Bong (Jeeesh)...he's supposed to be the comic relief I guess, but he's not funny at all, and is one of the most annoying characters you'll ever see on TV, that is until you get a load of his idiotic sidekick.The actors all seem out of place too, and seem mostly disinterested as the show drags on. Who can blame them really? Rain is your lead actor here as the PI; he gives a gallant effort to play along with all the stupidity, but he mostly comes across as a silly goof ball. Daniel Henney is one of the other 2 male leads. The dialogue he's given to work with is downright painful to listen to, and it's not helped by the fact that he still can't speak Korean. It appears he tries to learn the script in Korean but there apparently wasn't enough time, so he speaks the first few sentences of some conversations in Korean, then he speaks the rest in English. I'm not kidding, that's how ridiculous this show is! The lead actress walks around with an expression on her face that suggests she's wondering how her career sank to this level. I kinda felt bad for the actresses and actors involved, and you can almost tell, at about the midpoint of the show, that they're just clock watching hoping this giant turd they're stuck in will get flushed away soon. The writing and direction teams, however, should all be given a swift kick in the nuts.I think the show had visions of being a lighthearted version of \"Iris\" or thereabouts. It's more similar to a lighthearted version of \"A Man Called God\". That show was awful too, but at least it was outrageously awful. Both shows even include an evil dude in a wheelchair who doesn't need a wheelchair. I can only imagine what a veteran actor must be thinking when he reads the script and learns he's no longer crippled:\nVeteran Actor: \"Ummm, excuse me Mr. Director, I've been in a wheelchair this whole time, and now you want me to get up and just start walking around?\"\nMr. Director: \"Yeah, it'll be great. People will love it.\"\nVeteran Actor: \"You're an Idiot!\"This show is just a mess. There's very little (if anything) worthwhile here. There's only one character I even remotely liked and that's the cute girl cop who has a crush on her squad leader. Of course, (SPOILERS) they killed her character off in a ham fisted effort to inject some mandatory melodrama into the story.And, to add insult to injury to every male watching the show (or female if you swing that way), these geniuses decide to (SPOILERS) kill off just about every pretty lady on the show: the cute detective, the hot assistant to Henney's character, the pretty Japanese professor (oh wait, she's not killed, she's just in hiding for a while until she shows back up in what else but a wheelchair. Maybe they only had one wheelchair on set, and that's why the evil dude had to get up out of it, so the professor could sit down), and most egregiously, the PI office assistant with the amazing rack. They don't even bother to kill her, she just completely disappears from the show after a couple episodes without any explanation, and nobody seems to notice or care. I know if I were the PI, I'd be wanting to know where my cleavage bearing assistant is. Look, if they wanted me to watch this pile of garbage, the least they could've done was show me some titties, unfortunately, they couldn't even get that right! Bottom Line: This show sucked and was a complete waste of time. I suggest you watch something, anything, else instead. You'll thank me for it later!2 out of 10 stars!", "It is really like that, you dig Korean action drama or you don't. If you do, you may actually enjoy it quite a bit. There is not much logic here, true, and reasons for anything are, at the very best, faintly perceptible. But is not really the point. You have plenty of crazy action, sometimes funny, sometimes silly, occasionally a bit sad. What else do you need? Rain (Ninja Assassin) is really good. He steps into the character with ease, playing a rouge, funny, silly and sometimes surprisingly serious PI, in the very best tradition of the original Lupin III manga series. Lee Na-young (Ruler of Your Own World) managed to make her character believable and, trust me, it was not an easy task - see the part about reasons above... :) The supportive crew is really good - Henney being sort of perfect for his character (a dubious honor, but true), and Lee Jung-jin and Yoon Jin-seo complementing each other perfectly. Special prize should go to Seong Dong-il, playing Namkamura Hwang, he is The Nakamura. ;) Martial arts choreography is impressive, although a little bit too smooth for my taste. Korean directors seem to prefer a dance-like quality in the fighting scenes and it shows - as usual. Yet I cannot honestly say it is some kind of a setback, just part of K-drama experience. ;) I got to really appreciate Lee Na-young performance in fighting scenes. She is not an action heroin and it's well worth seeing the special episode (\"21\") just to see how much work did she put to make it look like it does. Good camera work, in some scenes bordering on excellent, music fits the rhythm of action - sometimes vice versa. Seriously, what more could you want? And yes, to be honest, I would say a solid 6 out of 10, but the fact is, I just feel some guys tend to give bad score simply because they don't like K-action drama. So - bear with me and enjoy! :)"], "994": ["Good cast, particutly Uhm Tae-Woong who i will add to my list of asian actors I admire.

It can make you laugh sometimes, but it shows how different the culture of Korea is, comparing to ours (at least mine, in south-America). That is NOT love. The protagonist Oh Haani is obsessed with the guy, just because he is handsome. He treats her so badly it makes you wanna kill him sometimes. Meanwhile Jungu, a not very popular guy in her school, keeps doing so many things from his heart but she is so blind to see them. The guy feels superior during ALL the dorama, at least, I was waiting him to realise \"he may be a very good student, but she is superior in other aspects\" but nope... That doesn't happen. He even puts many conditions to her. \"We will marry if you study more\" \"You love me, you can't love another guy\" \"You are too ugly for me, but sometimes you are pretty, so it's OK\". etc. It's so sad and one feels pity about her. The dorama doesn't 'teach' you anything. Directors should have insisted in the fact that \"being successful at school doesn't mean you are superior than others\", they should have make a situation in which this 'perfect' guy fails... They should have made him suffer like Oh Haani, who is suffering 90% of the chapters. Even the little brother of him, keeps insulting her.

Predictable but still interesting. I loved the long way they both had to finally realize their feelings(especially for the guy who during a very long time \"hates\" her). It's a some sort of love/hate relationship. The acting is not great but OK, the two main actors have a good chemistry and it's always nice to look at them. It's a lovely and funny story about a conquest of the heart of the coldest guy even after multiple rejections.

Playfull kiss doesn't stray too much of the original story, though they did add some of the korean playfulness in it. There were some notes from the Princess's hour as well (see the stuffed bears in the end of the episodes). And it did start nicely, although, I must confess, I didn't expect much from the male lead. However, it was cute, even though the story was full of cliche and the leading lady was a silly, airheaded girl. But, the drama got boring halfway. It lost all the interesting chemistry that the couple had and the cat and dog game got tiring. So, overall, 5 out of 10 for playful kiss.", "I have read many people, mentioning this drama a..k.a Playful Kiss as one of their favorite dramas. So, I honestly had my hopes up and was eagerly looking forward for a great rom-com when I began watching this.But my high expectations were soon shattered and I was disappointed as the story was very lame and unrealistic.SPOILER AHEAD: Kim Hyung Joong's character Baek Seung-jo was supposed to be a genius at studies with a high level of IQ who has the potential of entering any top university and perusing any profession. Initially, he is annoyed by Oh Ha ni played by Jung So min who has a mega crush for him. Jung So Min's character is portrayed as a very clumsy, needy, weak girl which made me annoyed with her character. Yet, Beak's mother seems to be in favour of Ha ni and even wants to make her the wife of his son despite how stupid she appears and dislike of his son. The couple in fact ends marrying at a very young age.Overall, I somehow ended up finishing the drama as the couple was cute and I liked both Kim Hyung Joong and Jung So Min. I feel the lead actor and actress did justice to their characters. I'm sure it would be such a great drama if the screen writing was better.", "Baek Seung-jo does not love Oh Ha Ni for who she is.

Playful Kiss is recently added to Netflix. I've watched it, because of the male lead who played in my favorite series Boys over Flowers. I thought this would be a sweet story about a serious guy who melts thanks to a warm-hearted girl. In stead I watched an arrogant boy and commitment fobic to that, conquering each and everyone including the girl. They should have called this series: The Perks of Being Perfect.Playful Kiss begins like many Japanese/Korean romantic comedies: introducing the leading man as the hottest guy in school. School girls are fan girling behind his back, teachers are drooling over his high test results, some girls are mean to his supposed love interest, the unfortunate girl gets support from another guy who's secretly in love with her. The male superstar appears to be blatantly blind to all this. He prefers to live like a recluse, because deep down he seems to be a nice guy who is embarrassed by all this. Or..he is simply an arrogant,cynic jerk, think of Jane Austen's Mr.Darcy, before he was transformed by his lovely Elizabeth. We, the viewers, are supposed to give him the benefit of the doubt.Usually I'm a big fan of these Asian versions of Pride and Prejudice. Also in this TV show I recognize some elements: a feisty girl, with lots of laughs and friends, is infatuated with a humorless Mr. Perfect at first sight. He wounds her pride, when the whole world is watching. She tries to forget him, aided by other admirers who would love to have a date with her, but she can't. Au contraire, her love grows stronger each year. The subject of her love is aware of all this, but he stays aloof, thinking he's the best match anyway.The fact that I didn't like this story as much as I wanted to, is probably my assumption that Mr. Perfect would become more humble in the end. I thought he would become a better version of his former self, starting to be a lovable person from now on. All I could see was a perfectionist, who claims the purest love available, using it to reinforce his own ambitions, namely being the best in a working field he starts to feel a passion for.All in all I give Playful Kiss a 7 out of 10, because the actors are well matched, and almost the whole cast is doing a great job.", "Currently on Netflix (2016) this series is known as \"Playful Kiss\" for US viewers. I've seen the story before titled \"Mischievous Kiss: Season 1 and Season 2,\" done by the Japanese. That series was undoubtedly influenced by this South Korean version, which was done first. At any rate, I really enjoyed both versions. There are very slight differences but the core story remains the same: girl likes boy who could not care less about her... until events unfold that give her small bits of hope, like crumbs left on the ground to follow a path. It's how the story unfolds that draws us in. Many times I laughed out loud. Often I had a silly grin on my face. There were times I couldn't stop the watery eyes. I was rooting for Oh Ha Ni all the way - her character was just so adorable and spirited, and good. Oh, and she daydreams! Anyone who enjoys love stories, no matter the culture, should enjoy this. I'm English-Irish American and I did! And I plan to watch it again. I could give spoilers, but why do that when one can just watch it to see if they like it?

The storyline has the feel of an 'after school special' and stars young kids just getting in to Sungkyunkwan University to study to become government officials. Its full of student hazing, bullying, student and national politics all revolving around a small group of the students. Like Twelfth Night, this story involves a girl dressing as a guy and entering an all male environment (in this case a male only university). The protagonists are all extremely likable, and most of the antagonists actually grow on you as the story progresses. This is one of my top 5 favorite k-drama TV series. The story is slightly PG-13 in my opinion in that it does have major characters from the local gisaeng house (female 'entertainers' of the period in potentially every sense of the word, rather like a geisha house). Also, for those that are particularly squeamish, our hero is distressed because he thinks he is falling in love with another guy (our heroine in her brother's clothes). All part of the comedy. The story is ridiculous because no one who looked at her would believe she was a guy for one moment, but just suspend your disbelieve and enjoy the stupidity and fun. I very highly recommend this series.", "The plot is well written. Leads all perform up to standard.

However, the story started to drag after a while. Plus, the leading lady was annoying (not her performance of course, she was really good, but her character was just...eh...)

However the intense climate to the movie will leave many viewers walking away head bowed and slightly traumatised by its conclusion.The movie 'The Scarlet Letter', is one of the many Korean movies that is finding an audience in the west. With Hollywood churning out clone after clone of various genre movies, this Asian invasion could not have come at a better time. It is comforting to know that somewhere creative and challenging cinema is still being produced and distributed.The story of 'The Scarlet Letter' involves a cop, Ki-Hoon, who whilst investigating a murder re-ignites a fling with his lover. The actual case that he is solving serves more as a backdrop with the main story focusing on the marital paradigmn between the protagonist, his wife and the lover.The idea of a hardworking cop being torn between his devotions to the one he loves and duty may not seem like the most original premise. Many a cop movie/series has been devoted to such scenarios, movies like Micheal Mann's 'Heat' or 'Leathal Weapon' spring to mind. Yet what raises this movie above the average cop thriller is the frightening way Asian cinema is able to change the mood of a movie from one frame to another.This is now a hall mark of Asian cinema and is rooted in a tradition whereby genres such as comedy, horror, romance and thrillers can be mixed all together in one movie, take Japanese (Kitano) or Hong Kong (John Woo) cinema as examples. For the last fifteen years Asian cinema has been producing genre defying movies. Korea has now entered into the fray and are producing movies where suspense, romance and terror can be weaved into a narrative and still retain a sense of realism. This is what Hollywood is failing to achieve, with too many Hollywood movies reliant on staple genres and archetype heroes.After a brief respite Asia is once again paving a way for modern cinema to develop and surprisingly Korea seems to be the next port of call for the attention of the movie loving west.A difficult movie to watch, but one that is worthy of your attention.", "The Scarlet Letter is an excellent film for fans of unique cinema. Part erotic thriller, part murder mystery, part police procedure, part extreme cinema, but somehow masterfully pieced together into a single cohesive, disturbing, tragic, emotional and intellectually stimulating film experience.The cinematography, sound, music, acting, direction and script are all first rate. Although special mention must go to Lee Eun-ju, who steals every scene in a breathtaking performance, which was tragically her last as she committed suicide shortly after completing this project. Obviously she was in some serious emotional pain in her personal life at the time of filming, which she has used to add a raw and real emotional depth to her character.The storyline is deceptively simple, at first appearing to be a routine murder investigation plot, based on a fairly mundane murder, however as we get deeper into the film this plot takes a back seat to the real story which is a dissection of the investigating officer's (Han Suk-kyu)complicated personal life and his relationships with his wife and his girlfriend (Lee Eun-ju).It is in the complexities of this love triangle that the films true power and force really take place as the characters try to manage their lives as they slowly unravel. This leads to a climax that is emotionally overpowering and disturbing, and totally unique.This is very intelligent, artistic, mature, dark, thriller.", "Before watching this film, I was quite circumspect regarding the Korean origin. Though, I was intrigued by the fact that the lead actress committed suicide shortly after. In the first part of the film, the plot is rather common- a murder investigation, a policeman's family life, nothing spectacular. But as the plot evolves, it gets more intense. The policeman's life is duplicitous, oscillating between the amenable, newly pregnant wife and a very appealing mistress- the singer Ga-yee. From the time Ga-yee finds out she is pregnant too, everything gets really complicated. She is confronted with Ki-hoon's incapacity to commitment regarding the unborn child and her love for him develops into obsession. In the same time, during the murder investigation, Ki-hoon experiments some sort of physical attraction to the the former wife of the dead man- principal suspect. In a very twisted chance of fate, Ki-hoon and Ga-yee end up locked in the trunk of his car, in an isolated place. The scenes are quite shocking, picturing the raw despair and the dramatic moments are so intense that you almost believe they are real. The paroxysm is reached when Ga-yee has a spontaneous abortion and then begs Ki-hoon to shoot her, which he does. It is worth mentioning that these scenes are very cruel and bloody. The title of the film comes up by Ga-yee's confession that the name she wanted for the baby is Pearl, Hester Pryne's daughter in the novel \"The Scarlet Letter\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne. I was very impressed of the ending, in my honest opinion, the actors played excellent some of most complex and hard to imitate human feelings. If I should compare this film to other, it would be with \"Irreversible\".", "At first I wasn't sure whether I should watch the movie because of some negative comments, but I decided to give it a try. Bearing in mind that I could always turn it off if I didn't liked it. But I was pleasantly surprised. The story was something I never saw before. Very original. The movie has quite a few twists and surprises that makes sure you are never bored and after every new discovery you want to see how it all turns out. I would definitely recommend it to anyone I know. And if you are lucky enough to obtain a copy or can buy the DVD, don't hesitate.8 out of 10.", "This is one of those films where you can't help but improvise. It has those scenes where you shout out brilliant, but then proceed to make a few alterations to the already produced script to make the thing workable, if not believable.There are many awful south Korean films out there (for whatever reason, most of them seem to be romantic comedies)-- this is not one of them. Unfortunately this is no \"Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance\" or \"Sorum\" either. There are a handful of brilliant scenes in this film, including one particularly claustrophobic segment that reminded me of a permutation of Tarantino's Kill Bill Volume 2. Unfortunately, these moments are mired in irrelevance, overacting, and implausibility.By all means, have a drink, take the film in -- but be prepared to throw a huge amount of constructive criticism at your TV. Be prepared to start writing a screen play, maybe take up non-linear editing as a hobby.", "This is vague to avoid spoilers, but the nature of the bad votes is because the movie's message and depth is beyond the average viewer, especially when considering many of IMDb's voters won't be watching this in it's native language, so the already purposely puzzling Mystery/Thriller aspects of the story coupled with the unique message concerning the title, The Scarlet Letter, could cause confusion with either plot thread, making the movie unsuccessful to that viewer. About the title, it should make sense after the last 5-10 minutes of the movie and is probably not what most people would think after watching the prior 95% OR being familiar with the original Scarlet Letter. Give this whole movie a chance, feel free to talk it out with friends during the movie (it is a mystery) and be...moved or awed at the end. For a mood, be ready for a darker ending than most movies (not the same dark as say Arlington Road though). It wraps up well and should leave you feeling OK.10/10. The movie really achieves what it aspired for and remains thoughtful in a usually \"for entertainment only\" genre (murder/mystery). perfect ending song too, reminiscent of Oldboy (2004). otherwise low-key soundtrack that is well done. Don't let the Korenglish song sung early on by 1 character put you off.", "An entirely misrepresented film (lesbian cover, Reeeeeeely?) with truly Tarantino level twists bogged down by Desperate Housewives style plot minus the laughs.First of all, this film's pacing is a mess. Over developed scenes stretch on for a quarter hour while an entire opportunity for a superb subplot is squeezed into 45 seconds.Moreover, characters are built up steadily only to end up all but irrelevant while important relationships are glossed over.Furthermore, the cynical poster shot of the two naked women in bed leads to nothing more than a minor footnote in the entire tale...The token lesbian moment looked quite literally as if it were tacked on just to rake in a few extra sales... Pretty poor showing...\nSeriously, what the hell were the marketing people thinking? Oh yes, they were probably cynically thinking of sales...OK, with the bad out of the way...This film had its glorious moments.... The acting and characterisation were first rate, all the major characters were excellently portrayed with top rank performances. Special props to the portrayal of the detective: equal parts charismatic and total shitbag.The sound editing was excellent.. Clear vocals with excellent ambience in every scene. Additionally, the classical music score and incidental BGM were without fault.But best of all, the camerawork and editing: Top notch... The cinematography is some of the best I've seen at this budget level and really played to the strengths of the storyline... Intimate closeups; dreamy, floaty vistas, Jagged, claustrophobic macros.... 10/10 and worthy of note for students of the genre.And THE SCENE... You'll know it when you watch it: Visceral enough to give Tarantino a hard-on.All in all, a worthwhile watch.... Just don't go in there for the lesbian scenes.", "i've seen many love stories, this story also resembles in many ways to rest of them especially in dealing with the theme\"Ex-marital affair\". It's a story of a police officer who has complicated relation with two women in his life. But the difference in this movie is along with this, the story unfolds the tragic death of a studio owner. Two parallel stories, but connected in some ways- the presence of a third person in married life.I suggest this movie to those who are tangled in two love relations at a time. The scene in trunk of the car is unexpected and gruesome evidence human frailties. Feelings such as despair,struggle for survival, shame, repentance and all the frustrating feelings crossing through the minds of both actors is a wonderful drawing of human life. That scenes are outstanding and unique from rest of the movie.", "This Scarlet Letter is about the resemblance of the detective's life story to the murder mystery he is trying to solve.

I've seen a lot these types of shows over the years and this one's not bad. I won't heap the undeserved praise (my opinion) on it that the other two reviewers did, and I feel its current IMDb rating of 8.2 stars is a bit on the high side. Nevertheless, it is good enough and solidly watchable.SPOILERS AHEAD!If you don't know what a Gumiho is, you clearly haven't watched much Korean cinema. This is at least the 6th different Korean movie or show I can think of (just off the top of my head) that involves one; there are probably dozens more of these stories though. A Gumiho is a mythical creature in Korean folklore; a nine tailed fox to be precise. The most similar mythical creature I can compare it to in western culture is a mermaid, and that's because they are both usually beautiful enticing creatures with or without supernatural powers that may or may not lead to your doom if you happen upon one.Gumiho stories and mermaid stories have been overused to say the least, but both legends provide a wide ranging spectrum to craft a story however you like. I've seen some really dark gumiho-centric stories, that involve torturing men and eating their livers, bringing about the destruction of the human race, taking over the world, etc. This particular show sits on the other end of the spectrum, and it's basically just a fluffy romantic comedy.I don't really have any problems with this show, it's just that it's pretty forgettable; it breezes right in and breezes right away just as quickly. Shin Min-a is your lead actress (the Gumiho). I've always had a thing for her, but that pretty much goes the same for any talented and pretty Korean actress. She's solid enough here. The lead actor is played by Lee Seung-gi, who is a young solo singing artist that I don't recall seeing in any acting role before this. He doesn't yet have the star power of Min-a, but he did just fine in his role as well. He plays a struggling young action actor who's trying to break into the big time. EDIT 10-9-2018: Seung-gi is quite well known now compared to when I originally wrote this review years ago. The story (which I will try to recall from memory) begins with Min-a trying to be married off in the Joseon era. Rumors are swirling that she might be a Gumiho though, so she has no takers; everyone fears it will bring doom and destruction upon their village, and as a man, I'd rather slowly destroy my liver the old fashioned way, instead of having it ripped out of my torso and watch it being eaten as I die a painful death. Heartbroken that nobody wants her, Min-a realizes she has no place in society and is subsequently banished into a temple painting/mural to be stored for all eternity (this is another common Korean legend concerning how immortal and inhuman creatures, beasts, etc...can be dispatched of). I can't remember if she does this voluntarily out of sheer despair, or is captured by a Gumiho hunter.Flash forward to 2010. Min-a is getting pretty tired of \"living\" in this painting for the last several hundred years, so she tricks our young male lead who happens upon the temple into uttering the right phrase or doing the right thing that will release her. He does so, and from there it's mostly a straightforward \"mythical\" rom-com (kind of along the lines of the American movie: \"Splash\"). There are lots of cute moments that follow where he discovers who/what she really is, and where she learns about the modern world and follows him around so she can eat more of her favorite dish (i.e. cow). Her 9 tails pop out uncontrollably whenever she gets overly excited, and she's helps him out of numerous jams using her super human abilities. At one point, she even saves his life using her special powers.The 2 leads quickly begin to fall in love, but all is not perfect; other characters find out about, or begin to suspect something is a little off with, Min-a, as she and Seung-gi try to keep her true identity secret. There's also a modern day Gumiho hunter (who apparently does not understand how shirt buttons work) that's hot on her trail. Eventually, Min-a decides she wants to become human and live her life as a \"normal\" person with her true love. She's given a magical elixir by the Gumiho hunter that may just fulfill her wishes; it's not without risks though, as she or her new love or both may perish if she takes it. Down the hatch it goes though and let's see what happens.From there, it's a matter of what will happen to the two leads as they wait to see if they'll survive her transformation into becoming a human. And, of course, whether he, she, or both survive is dependent upon how strong their love is for one another.Bottom Line: I don't think this show belongs in the 8-10 star range the current IMDb reviews and ratings suggest (again, just my opinion). I've seen a lot of Korean melodramas over the years, so I feel I have a pretty good prospective on this genre. That being said (written), this show is quite enjoyable overall, and I have no problem recommending it. I also think it's a good recent \"starter\" show if you're not yet familiar with KTV dramas, as it's not as overly \"taxing\" as many other KTV melodramas can often be. It's a light and short comedic romance series that's pretty effective at what it's trying to accomplish, and what's not to like about that?I think 7 stars is just about right, so that's what I'm giving it!", "My Girlfriend is a Gumiho is a title I avoided for over a year after it arrived for European consumption. I had long ago become a big fan of the charming \"KDramas\" and \"JDramas\" from South Korea and Japan. Often inspired or even derived from anime and manga, these dramas, though generally formulaic, are wonderfully acted, charming, funny often, and hearken back to a time when movies and TV shows were great without gratuitous violence or demeaning language. But I avoided \"My Girlfriend is a Gumiho\" because the title seemed to promise a television experience about as thought provoking as Beach Blanket Bingo. Out of boredom I decided to try it out one night when I was looking for something to tide me over while waiting for a title to appear that would be more promising.Sounds rather stupid, doesn't it? That's what I thought until I actually watched it.I was so wrong. It only took one complete episode and I realized MGIAG was something special. The two leads, Lee Seung Gi as Cha Dae Woong, the brash but good hearted college guy whose dream is to be an action star, and Shin Min-Ah as Gu Mi Ho, the \"Gumiho\" or \"Nine Tailed Fox\" a mystical creature who takes the form of a beautiful girl, are fantastic. These two wonderful actors inhabit these cute roles that start out as silly and adorable and slowly take on deeper meaning as the two of them begin to realize they have feelings for one another, and then tragic overtones as they realize that they most likely can never be.I swear I have never laughed so much as I did during the early episodes, nor have I cried so much as I did during the final three or four episodes as they acknowledge their love and grow into powerful souls devoted to protecting the other at all costs. The entire cast is wonderful, and the production values are excellent The music goes from fun and tuneful to sweet and haunting. I cannot recommend this drama enough.", "i'm fairly new to Korean drama/ comedy. so far this is in the top 3 that i have seen. i found it to be delightful,charming and funny . made me feel good every time. i also enjoyed the shows \" playful kiss \" and \" boys over flowers \". i wish more shows emphasized such honesty of emotion. i often feel the sense that i am gaining something positive after viewing these shows. they seem to run the gamut of emotions. \" my girlfriend is a gumiho \" does not disappoint . i think if you have love in your heart. you will enjoy this show. the portrayals of character were very convincing for me. if you like to smile a lot , watch\" my girlfriend is a gumiho \"", "My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho has a split personality; a light & fun initial half and an emotionally packed second half to the series.Successful formula for this series that I grew to love: Super Cute Couple + spunky Gumiho leading lady + romantic gestures from the leading man that will be tough to topSuper Cute Couple: Dae-woong and Mi-ho are the cutest - Finger guns blazing for how adorable they are!Spunky Gumiho leading lady: Mi-ho's forthright honestly about her feelings for Dae-woong and becoming a human were charming (though the honestly waned in the latter episodes to \"protect\" Dae-woong). Romantic gestures from the leading man: The evolution Dae-woong from spoiled boy to sacrificing-all-for-his-Gumiho man slayed me. What didn't work about this series? The adult romance was ridiculous, the other secondary characters were one dimensional and the second leads didn't stand a chance thwarting the leading couple. Dong-joo, the half- human/ghost was too pretty and wooden be an impact. Hye-in was a successful obstacle initially but she just couldn't compete with star- crossed destiny and faded away. **SPOILER** When without hesitation Dae-woong ingests the fox bead with the full understanding he must die to return the bead to Mi-ho, is a huge moment and forever seals my love for this character. Initially Dae-woong was so unworthy and selfish, hard to believe he evolved so far. The final episode had me transitioning from one crying jag to the next, Dae-woong ingesting the fox bead without hesitation and willing to die for Mi-ho, their airport reunion, the last day together, when Mi-ho disappears, Dae-woong getting hit by the truck, Mi-ho calling Dae-woong \u2013 would one phone call be it?, Mi-ho finally reappearing and their reunion, the tears just flowed. **SPOILER**", "\"My girlfriend is a Gumiho\" is a popular South Korean romantic-comedy- mythological drama series that involved the story of a gumiho or a nine tailed fox whose desire is to live human life and an ambitious actor guy who incidentally met her. And it's a worth-watching melodrama series. Initially my sassy girl-crush Jun Ji Hyun turned down the role of heroine gumiho- that's great because it's destined to be Shin-Min-Ah's show I think. She was very cute, natural, and lovely as a gumiho, also a real fashionista- most of the times her simple dress-up suited her perfectly. The chemistry between her and the talented hero Lee Sung- Gi ( as Cha-Tae-Woong) was adorable too bringing both emotional and funny scenes. Yes, many times the drama was so funny that I laughed a lot and felt that it's one of the best drama series I had watched so far. A lot of passers-by and random characters focused by camera also added more natural flavor. The soundtracks specially the theme song were awesome and natural acting of other side characters- half human Dong-Ju ( thumbs up for No Min Woo! ) , Woong's aunt and grandfather , director and villain-like Hye-In brought fun and suspense. So although in the ending episodes it became a bit clich\u00e9 and a little more story development and care for side characters would be much better, overall it's a lovely-enjoyable drama. However, 500+ years old gumiho obviously reminded me of 400+ years old alien Do Min Joon (Kim Soo Hyun) from my previously watched outstanding series \"My Love from the Star\". Gumiho heroine looked too naive where alien hero looked cool and wise but undoubtedly the both were so adorable at so many times. So why all these cute and lovely supernatural creatures from fictions come to Korea only can be a topic of good thoughts! :p :)", "THE GOOD An interesting premise The first half is consistently funny The smile of the lead actress lights up the screenTHE BAD I think this is best described as a product for kids: light in tone, little story development, and with plot holes so immediately evident it is impossible to brush them aside and remain engaged in the product.There are some conventions in K-dramas that you know you must accept: people sleep fully clothed, doors are never locked, a few hospital scenes, one or both characters are orphans, mobile phones are used extensively except when most needed, and so on. I accept all of those. But here are a few other major problems of this show, assuming you are older than twelve.A premise of UNLIMITED potential (supernatural immortal being awakes in a modern world totally unfamiliar to her, guy has to manage both her power and her ignorance) is criminally underutilized. Unnumbered gags were set aside in the name of conventional K-drama staples.The lead actress is excellent in her role, conveying cuteness, innocence, and making you wish you could be there to help her out and protect her: you simply struggle to imagine someone else doing a better job. But what of the show beside her performance? It would lose a lot of its appeal, right?The gumiho being is not realistically portrayed. She is full-innocent bordering on dumb. For comparison take the Japanese animated series \"Spice and Wolf\", which has a very similar premise: an immortal wolf-goddess somehow joins a guy and gets to live in the world of men. She is ignorant of most things yet, since she has countless years of experience and is a superior being, she is able to figure out things in her own way; also, her moods continuously straddle between cocky confident and scared ignorant. It seems likely that would be her reaction and behavior, no? In a show that lasts 16 episodes/hours, there is basically only one story told, that of the main couple. The usual sidekick couple story arc (in this case the aunt and the director) is pure comedy fodder and does not present any drama: we are never in any doubt that they will be happy together in the end.The story of the doctor/teacher/phantom and his past could have been developed into something more consistent, but instead is limited to one single flashback repeated over and over: I felt that there was a great story in his past to be told to explain his feelings and decisions, but because it isn't properly told I never really connected with him.Episodes 10 and 15 are particularly infuriating, both because they seem edited by a madman with no regard for chronology and consequentiality, and because they exaggerate in their use of tired plot devices.Because the show is generally light, the cliffhangers at the end of most episodes are not very strong, totally absent, or botched. For example they managed to ruin the first kiss: you have waited eleven episodes for it, and when it finally arrives the episode ends mid-scene.Up until the twelfth episode the male lead shows no signs of sexual attraction towards either his original girlfriend or his new roommate (and in the latter case it can't be attributed to her being a gumiho, since he himself clearly states that he's not afraid of her). This is a complaint that I have with most of the K-dramas I have watched. I understand the decision to refrain from going into the sexual aspect of relationships, but I can't be asked to believe that young people have no physical impulses. Find a plot excuse to forbid/prevent them from having a sexual relationship (as they do in episode 12), or simply imply it off screen.Considering that you're never in doubt that the main couple will live happily ever after, there was too much drama at the expense of good comedy. In the same way, once the old lady shows up at the beginning of the last episode, a happy ending is implied, and that robbed me of any hand-wringing uncertainty.The talents of the male lead are poorly used: in the first few episodes he shows a nice comedic range of expressions and body language, but as the story progresses the script only requires him to look worried.In my humble opinion of western person, at least one scene depicting Miho's feral nature was needed to make her believable as potentially scary (something like her face gory with blood), but maybe for Korean/Asian people knowing she is a gumiho is enough.", "Come on people who don't like this drama is a weirdo. Yeah Lee Seung gi's acting is OK because he is acting like that in most of all his drama but I like his playful cheerful role here. Same goes with Shi min ah I like her acting, she's not so pretty but she's charming and she was acting very good, I like the way she's acting shameless, cheerful, and interesting at the same time. It is a good drama with a happy ending of course, don't expect not since it will ruin all the plot. The newcomer Na min woo is OK here compare to \"Midas\" and \"Full house 2 (which i find that drama is annoying and boring and predictable)\". I laugh a lot while watching this drama, this is an entertainment that I need after feeling stressful at work especially the embarrassing scenes between the aunt and the director, each time the director appeared the background music is leslie cheung's. Good plot and a very entertaining drama.The soundtrack sang by lee seung gi is really nice but singing is definitely not for shi min ah.", "My girlfriend is a gumiho has a weird description that will confuse some if they're not that familiar with the whole nine tail fox myth. Still, it's a classic because if you overcome that and watch it, it is rewarding. The leading lady is amazing playing the humanised fox who tries to adapt to not only modern society but also the human way of behaving. Actually, the first half of the drama focuses on the comical element and it is actually very funny. Eventually, however, the romance gets a bit too tiring, as things start to be on repeat and eventually there are too many clich\u00e9s. It's not that the two of them don't have chemistry, and actually the romance is cute and sweet, but it wasn't handled very well. The main song of the drama, on the other hand, was perfect for the whole supernatural themed and created the perfect mood for the drama. Finally, the second lead lady was kind of annoying, almost tiring in the end, though her acting was very good. Maybe it was the fact that she had that cold stare and she didn't blink (!). So, 6 out of 10.", "This stupid kid romance gain popularity by marketing.Typical overacting kids, overcliched beaten to death and insulting your brain over and over again. The same level stupidity with kadarshian reality show or maria mercedes etc.There's many other k-dramas are better than this crap. Unless you've already watched the other 100-150, you'd better pass this one."], "1005": [], "1006": [], "1007": ["Gloria is a 2010 Korean TV series about a young poor woman given a chance to become a singer/performer.SPOILERS AHEAD!Honestly, I'm having a hard time remembering a whole lot about this show. I'm sure I watched all of it (which I recall being somewhat of a masochistic endeavor), and this was only 2 years ago or so, but it obviously did not leave a very indelible impression on me for whatever reason. To be fair, I should probably watch it again before writing a review, but, there's just no way in hell I'm going to sit through 50 episodes again for something I've already seen that didn't stick with me the first time around. The main problem with this show should be obvious, i.e. it's just too freaking long. A fifty episode series is a bit cumbersome in this day and age of televised Korean melodramas. I don't have ADHD or anything, but this particular genre is just generally not suited to be stretched out for such a long period of time. I think the \"sweet spot\" for these K-drama shows is in the 12-16 episode range (maybe a little more or less on occasion). Sometimes, lengthier shows can work well if done right, but they are much more the exception rather than the rule. As it stands, 50 episodes did not work very well at all here, and as such, this show is stuck in some kind of \"no man's land\" territory of being somewhat epic in length, but not epic enough in story to match its run time.Here's your basic story and outline of this show (which will perhaps be the worst and most lazily summary I've written on this site): Bae Doo-na stars in the lead role as the soon to be named Gloria character. She's the poor girl working all kinds of odd jobs to help herself and her handicapped sister simply survive. \"Gloria\" eventually gets the chance to become a stage singer, but I can't quite remember how or why this exactly happens. She soon starts performing at a local club and also gets a contract/job with some record label or something that's run by a rich handsome dude who takes a liking to her. Gloria and the young record company owner are the main leads, and I'm pretty sure they eventually fall in love, have their trials & tribulations along the way, then probably live happily ever. There are 2 other secondary leads as well: Gloria's poor childhood male friend, and some pretty rich girl who decides to slum it for whatever reason, and falls in love with the poor male friend. There are family problems & secrets, side characters with hidden agendas, some singing along the way, resolutions to various love angles, typical melodrama, etc. Eventually, the poor boy has to go on the run for some reason, and, somebody owns a chicken restaurant at some point that all the characters frequent, and, blah, blah, blah!This show is probably 2 to 3 times longer than it should be in order to be effective. As a result, it's often rather bland and moves along at a snail's pace. It's also chock full of stock story lines and stereotypical characters; I am sick and tired of these K-drama shows rolling out the same 2 patriarchal characters over and over again (i.e. the poor worthless degenerate gambling scheming drunk vs. the rich entitled demanding snob who has to have things his way). If you based your real world view of Asian familial culture on the older male characters that frequently appear in these K-dramas, you'd wonder why anyone in Asia would have any respect for their elders at all.I did not really hate this show. I'd say indifference, or ambivalence, is more of my overriding opinion of it. There are some bright spots here and there, and basic story would have been very workable in a shorter format. Acting is solid enough (aside from the annoying cookie cutter old dudes and the gangsters from central casting). All of the 4 young protagonists are mostly easy enough to root for, and everybody involved did what they were supposed to. The plot repeats itself endlessly though, and it all just ends up dragging on forever. There came a time that I just didn't/couldn't care about this show anymore (somewhere about halfway through the show's run time). It eventually becomes more of a chore to keep following as it crawls along to completion, and, you'll almost certainly find yourself just \"going through the motions\" in order to finish watching it.I see this show is often summarized elsewhere using the buzz word \"intense\" (i.e. \"intense story\", \"intense lives\", etc). Frankly, that's laughable!...This series is no more intense, or set apart in any way, than any other standard K-drama show from this era. Truthfully, it's all very \"status quo\" in nature, except that it's so long in run time that it ends up being little more than downright tedious & boring when all is said and done.Bottom Line: If you have a 50 some hour show with the terrific Bae Doona at your disposal, and nothing really ends up being memorable, then your show has some problems...namely, that its 50 some hours long!Unless you're a Doona filmography completest, don't bother watching this. Your time could be much better spent watching 3 other similar modern K-drama shows which are much more economical, streamlined, and better, than this series is.6 out of 10 stars!P.S. This show is just WAY TOO LONG (in case I haven't made myself clear yet)!"], "1008": [], "1009": [], "1010": [], "1011": [], "1012": ["Running Man is a long running Korean variety show that began in 2010 and is still airing today as of this review. It has become extremely popular all across Asia over its roughly 160 episode run time to date, and, it doesn't take long to see its universal appeal once you start watching it.SPOILERS AHEAD!There's nothing to spoil here; there's no linear story or end goal. More or less, it's just a simple comedy/reality/variety/entertainment/game show that airs on a weekly basis. I can't think of any show being televised in the west that's quite like it. It's a bit similar to Amazing Race, but its closest comparison is to other past KTV variety shows; X Man, Family Outing, & Infinite Challenge come to mind for obvious reasons.Basic premise: Seven regular cast members get together with a few different guest stars each week to compete in various missions that result in the loser(s) being embarrassed &/or the winner(s) being rewarded. There's a heavy chase/tag element to the show, along with a varying array of games, role playing, puzzle solving, and daring challenges. The cast use their wits, bravery, and/or intuition in order to come out on top. It's usually very simple and silly stuff, but it does serve as an effective mechanism to deliver some solid entertainment along the way.The cast members are outstanding in their designated roles; they originally consisted of 7 dudes who were slotted to play various personas within the bigger picture of entertaining viewers. In addition, there's one female cast member who hopped on board, and she is awesome. Other than a few early adjustments, the original cast has mostly remained intact, and they work very well together as whole In order to make this show work. They all have their own successful careers as MC's, actors, singers, rappers, etc., but they all dutifully clock in each Monday morning to play their parts on this show. They really seem to enjoy each other's company as well, and they collectively exude a clear bond as some sort of secondary working family. Search any of the regular cast members if you need more info regarding them and/or their specific roles on this show.I've been watching this show regularly since the very first episode. It was raw and had a very limited budget in the beginning, but you could clearly see its potential; it soon found its footing, started ascending the coveted KTV ratings chart, and it has been off and \"running\" ever since. It has evolved & diversified over time, namely; several new concept themes were added, and the show has been taken out of its confined late night settings in favor of operating in broad daylight in full view of the public. Otherwise, its basic original premise has mostly remained unchanged.This show doesn't have a fixed script per se, but it is produced and directed in such a way to achieve a desired outcome, so it's not \"reality\" by any means. The cast is basically informed as to what needs to be accomplished, then they set out to get the job done while hamming it up in typical KTV variety fashion. If need be, the show is nudged back in the right direction or a new direction, according to what's best for any given episode; fortunately, this is all done with as minimal heavy handedness as possible, so as not to disrupt the overall free flowing feel of the show. There's also a unique balance & symmetry at play with these Korean variety/reality shows between directors, cast, crew, guests, production teams, editing dept., etc...Everybody seems to be on the same page to try to achieve what is best for the overall good of the show.There is a lot to like here. The show is packed full of fantastic guest stars on a regular basis, and the way it engages itself with the general public is fascinating to watch play out; normal citizens going about their everyday lives could soon find themselves involved in helping out the cast members accomplish whatever silly mission is at hand for that day. It also serves as sort of a Korean tourism guide and cultural experience; if you were ever planning on visiting Korea, you could literally use this show as your travel itinerary as to where to go and what to do, see, eat, experience, etc.On the down side, the cast (who I dearly love) can be a tad annoying with their antics and clamoring for screen time (particularly the MC, who's otherwise very effective when not acting too much the clown), and it's sometimes hard to make all 90+ minutes of a particular show entertaining when you only have 12+ hours of footage to edit. The show has likely already peaked as well, and it's hard to imagine it getting any better or sustaining its pace; it's simply becoming increasingly difficult to keep the show fresh & I'm not sure how long everyone involved can keep this phenomenon going. Inevitably, all good things must come to an end, but if &/or when they ever call it quits, or various cast and/or crew members have to move on in life, etc., there is no doubt that this show will have had an incredibly successful run!Summary; this show has been consistently entertaining and often wildly hilarious throughout its duration. Once it finds its rhythm, there are very few episodes that have disappointed in delivering very family friendly fun and entertainment on a weekly basis. If you have not been watching Running Man, you have missed out on one of the best TV shows, from any country, in years.Bottom Line: Don't Walk, Run to watch this show before it's too late!...9 out of 10 stars!... HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!", "No need to hide the fact that a lot variety shows have evolved since Infinity Challenge (Muhan Dojeon). And to be honest I do think Running Man was inspired by it. The chasing game, action-blockbuster style was first done on Infinity Challenge but of course, Running Man bring their own creativity to the table.The show started out with 7 Running Men but added Song Ji-hyo as the 8th but then Song Joong-ki left and so it's still 7 members till this date.This show is certainly a must watch. It dwells in humorous psychological battle and then comes the physical war and in between you've got romance/bromance and family.The show also offers themed-episode to match the current trending movie or drama. They've also pay tribute to all-time favorite movies which makes me find myself reminisce.The solid performance from the Nation's MC, Yoo Jae-suk has brought the show to a new level in variety world. Kim Jong Kook is certainly a tough guy on the outside but vulnerable on the inside. Haha with vast variety experiences has no problem standing proud with his wits. Ji Suk Jin first attempt at outdoor variety show does have it flaws but he's done great given his age. Newcomers Lee Kwang-soo, Kang Gary and Song Ji-hyo are not afraid to go all out and give their everything to entertain the viewers.I know that Running Man started out with determination making their own flavor and style but recently I find most episodes a bit repetitive and lost it poise. Members' characters has become stagnant. Since everyone is now doing more jobs (thanks to Running Man popularity), it feels like they don't try to make improvement in this show. I know it's not easy to make people laugh but I wish something more and new on other departments; action, romance.I give a 9 because there's still room for improvement. I hope Running Man will survive just like IC and continue to save me from my weekly distress.", "Last year, when SBS said that this program will be stopped.

Just appearing on running man can turn a previously unknown into a beloved member of the running man family. So how did i get from watching American television to watching a foreign (South Korean) television show with subtitles? Well bored one night from the usual tv, i googled indie film festival winner. and a Korean movie came back as the result. I watched it and to my surprise the actors lips weren't moving independent of their voices .. they weren't flying thru the sky in impossible kung foo leaps on a grainy tv picture.. what i watched was a drama with as high quality filming acting and writing as i have ever seen. So i watched two more, then completely captivated went for gold and googled best Korean movie. That came back as jewel in the palace. watched that and to this day i watch more Korean TV than American. I don't even notice subtitles anymore unless they are missing. Back to running man. So i wanted to see more of my now favorite movie stars (who were/are South Korean) i came across \"running man\" as it had guests on the shows. I could watch my favorite stars outside the box you might say. Next thing i knew my favorite stars included the running man cast. They went to Dubai where i shared my amazement with theirs at the gold vending machines, the great barrier reef in Australia where they dove for treasure chests to Hong Kong and the great wall of china. Not to mention fantastic places all over South Korea. I learned a lot of parlor games and games which could be used at birthday parties. I love some of the running side themes which carry over between episodes, such as the James Bond like cast member. the spartan and the betrayer.

Cinderella's Sister (aka Cinderella's Stepsister) is a melodramatic \"cryathon\" that aired on Korean TV a year or two ago. For anybody who's not familiar with this genre, it's basically just a soap opera with a set run time and (hopefully) an end goal. There are loads of Korean dramas like this, and, well my Korean girlfriend (God bless her) really likes this stuff and wants me to watch with her, so yeah, I watched this whole series!SPOILERS AHEAD!Your basic story: Widowed winery owner with young carefree \"princess\" daughter meets unprivileged widow with standoffish \"evil stepsister\" daughter. Widower and widow soon get married. Widow is more or less just looking to cease going from one loser relationship to another, and she succeeds in accomplishing this by wedding the winery owner. As a result, their daughters are thrust together and are mostly left to get along as newly anointed sisters.For the first 5 episodes or so, the story focuses on the 2 families getting together, at which time the daughters are 14 year old high school girls. The daughters clash from the beginning, even though the widower's daughter tries her best to welcome her new step sister with open arms. The widower's daughter is bubbly, sheltered, and a little annoying, but she's kind and doesn't mean any harm. On the other hand, the widow's daughter is an abrasive ass; yeah, she's had a tough life to date, but the amount of undeserved vitriol she spews on her newfound sister makes you not want to like her character at all. Both girls have a crush on some older dude who's working at the winery. Eventually, this dude falls in love with the widow's daughter, but ends up leaving the winery before love can blossom between the two. He doesn't really want to leave his new love though, so he does so via perhaps the most unmanly and idiotic scapegoat way possible; instead of just telling the girl he loves her and wants to be with her, he sneaks off to board a train without any notice, and gives a letter (written in Spanish no less) to the widower's daughter to pass along to her sister, which basically begs the widow's daughter to come stop him from leaving if she loves him. And, he does this knowing the two stepsisters hate each other at this point, and that the widower's daughter is still in love with him, and not to mention the fact the widow's daughter is just learning Spanish. WTF???...This is our hero???...If I tried this nonsense in real life, I'd either get laughed at or ignored, and probably both.The series then skips forward to when the daughters are in their early twenties, and, goes forward from there as all the main characters eventually re-converge. Dude who took the train out of town shows back up in the sisters lives, and they all have to eventually work together to save the winery. Dude is still upset that widow's daughter didn't stop him from leaving when they were younger. Perhaps he should have been more direct or used a better method years ago, or maybe tried to call or write his love sometime during the 8 years he was away. Idiot!The rest of the series pretty much goes as follows: love/work/family related problems crop up, the characters cry/yell/do something absurd, melodramatic/happy/romantic music ensues, issues are resolved, then repeat until the story arc is completed. In the meantime, everyone stares off into the distance, and reminisces A LOT! There's also many misunderstandings and wild changes in character's demeanors as events unfold, people faint or die upon hearing bad/shocking news, there's about a billion instances of someone grabbing another person's arm as they're about to walk away, buckets of tears are shed, and of course, there's always some evil person(s)/company behind the scenes, and (perhaps) ulterior motives among all the main characters, etc.This show really tested my limits I rolled my eyes often at the heavy formulaic melodrama involved here (my GF was not pleased with this!). That being disclosed, I did kinda like this show overall in some strange sort of way, and there's a good bit to like here; both lead actresses gave solid performances throughout, although I could barely tolerate the stepsister character most of the time. The widower was perhaps those most fair and stand up character I've ever seen in any Korean melodrama. And, it was good to see the 2 sisters grow some over time and eventually come to an understanding, which led to a nice touching moment in the finale. Also, I generally felt bad for the widower's daughter who mostly got crapped on by just about everybody throughout the entire series.As for the male leads, Chun Jung Myung did what he was asked quite well, but his character was not very likable either, although it should be noted that he and the often unlikeable stepsister seemed a perfect match for one another. As for Taecyeon; he has a nice body for the ladies to drool over, but his acting is questionable at best. In his defense though, he's given nothing to do other than follow the stepsister around like a sickly puppy or overhear random conversations for the sake of advancing plot points.I may have liked this story if it were streamlined into a shorter miniseries format and it cut down on the nonsense some. But, if drawn out to a longer format (with no end in sight), I might have faked my own death in order to avoid watching it. However, I do like this KTV method of airing shows for a specific number of episodes, then moving on to the next show. This particular show, while not without faults, works well enough to recommend ONLY if you're a fan of/familiar with K-dramas. If not, it's borderline excruciating.7 out of 10 stars.", "You really should watch this series , I wish if they make another season of this series because it's really emotional , thrilling , and dramatic story. I watched so many Korean movies and series and this one is one of my favorite series between the ones I saw."], "1027": [], "1028": ["Personal Taste is a 16 episode 2010 kdrama where the two leads strive to make this drama work but the story line eventually stymies' their efforts leaving a B-grade drama.Our male lead, Jin-ho, lies to our female lead, Kae-I that he is gay so she'll rent a room to him in her father's house which he wants to study for an architecture design that will make or break his company. They fall for each other but the lie stops their romance. He eventually confesses, she is a doormat and accepts this huge deceit with ease. Their romance is the best part the show. They have chemistry and work hard to be likable. The middle episodes are their best. Unfortunately the story line is littered with annoying characters and plot decisions that pull entire series down. What I liked about Personal Taste:1. Lee Min-ho as Jin-ho. He has loads of appeal and the camera loves him. His character starts out as a cold fish in the initial episodes, warms up nicely in the middle, then is an idiot in the home stretch until the final episode epilogue where he sparks up again.2. Son Ye-jin as Kae-i. She has excellent chemistry with Lee Min-ho and they clicked as a couple. Her doormat character was annoying in the initial episodes, cute and charming in the middle, then a bit sad in the final episode where she offers him blind trust in the form of herself. The emotional payoff is in their epilogue scenes.3. Jung Sung-Hwa as Sang-Jun. He is Jin-ho's friend. He is funny impersonating Jin-ho's gay lover. I was horrified that the writers pair him with the despicable In-hee in the final episode, lazy storytelling.4. Ryu Seung-ryong as Do-bin. As the quiet, lonely director, this actor embodies this character with human kindness and is an emotional touchstone.What I did not like about Personal Taste:1. Wang Ji-Hye as In-Hee. Supposedly Kae-I's friend but she is selfish, willing to use and abuse to get her way. This annoying character had no growth during the series. 2. Ahn Seok-Hwan as Yun-Seop (Chang-Ryeol's Dad). I loved this actor in Delightful Girl Chun-hyang but here he portrays a one dimensional annoying character that sneers, bribes, and bullies his way through life.3. Choi Eun-Seo as Hye-Mi. Another annoying character that believes she has a chance with Jin-ho. Worthless and whining, the script this character was given was a waste.", "Personal Taste is a story about a guy who pretends to be gay in order to become a roommate of a female friend,who is still characterized by innocence and naivety. Jeon Jin Ho is a straight guy who pretends to be gay in order to become a roommate to his female friend, Park Kae In. His hobbies include organization and ironing, and he's known for his stoic poker face. He's a stickler for cleanliness, but he also has a talent for figuring out a women's feelings. Kae In is very trusting even though she has a habit of being betrayed. However that doesn't stop her from giving people the benefit of doubt and Jin Ho is no different. How will Kae In react when she finds out that her gay roommate is not actually gay at all and that he has fallen for her?It touches issues such as maturity, being organized and creative, how to hold onto life when things don't go one's way and how to become successful in business. The leads have the greatest of chemistry. As usual, the great Son Ye-jin continues to amaze while Lee Min-Ho can stand on his own amidst the great actress. The story is a good one and a must see especially for Son Ye-jin fans. Check this out.It definitely good entertainment.", "This was a stellar series. I have seldom watched anything that gave me as much true enjoyment. Right up till the ending...The first 2/3 were pure heaven. Gae In mistakenly assumes Jin Ho is a homosexual, and he allows her to continue thinking that so that she will feel comfortable renting out a room to him. The two overcome their differences, becoming friends, and eventually develop romantic feelings for each other\u2014much fun ensues. This section of the series had endless amounts of charm, warmth, comedy, and romantic tension. It always kept me guessing and avoided clich\u00e9s like the plague.Then, in episode 11, the cat came out of the bag\u2014Jin Ho was not gay, he loved Gae In, and wanted be loved by her. At first I thought, \"This is good; we get to enjoy seeing them together.\" However, I found that \"Personal Taste\" lost a lot of its peculiar charm at this point\u2014 it became another when-will-they-have-sex story. Still, it gained another kind charm. It became the story of a man and woman who were trying to make their relationship work, about two lovers who were trying to figure out how deal with past wounds and personality flaws, about two people respectfully combating parental disapproval, about a man lovingly waiting for sex until his woman was ready. Again, the series steered clear of clich\u00e9s.And then we spent the last three episodes on a completely unnecessary clich\u00e9d plot twist\u2014guy decides he should convince girl not to care about him, so guy treats girl worse than he ever treated his enemies.One of the things that made this series really great was the way Gae In and Jin Ho argued. They would get upset and say things they didn't mean, but then later apologize. It was realistic and compelling, but in the end the creators threw this away with both hands.Another thing that was great in this series was that Jin Ho spent a lot of time teaching Gae In to respect herself and not let people trample on her. However, in the end Gae In goes to Jin Ho and finally sleeps with him, though he has treated her like dirt, saying \"I will trust you no matter what, even if I get hurt.\" This completely went against everything that came before. I personally think that it is good to wait until marriage to have sex; however, I realize I am in the minority. Still, the series had led me to hope that the consummation would at least be happy and loving, but it was just sad and depressing.To add insult to injury, the creators left most of the subplots hanging in order to spend three episodes on this ghastly clich\u00e9, and then wound everything up quickly, saccharinly, and unrealistically. A very, very poor finish to a great story.Yes, I understand this is a romantic comedy, but there is no law stating that romantic comedies have to be dumb; and this one had constantly shown itself to be so much more. A sad waste of excellent writing and acting.So, if you read this and think you are like me, you might want to stop watching this series after the first 20 minutes of the 11th episode.", "This series really hovered between being so bad its good and being just plain bad. Visually this looks appalling, this looks like someones high school project. The plot is just a series of misunderstandings and two-dimentional irrational characters doing stupid stuff for 16 hours. The best part of this series is the awful execution of an even worse script leading to this series unwillingly having some really funny moments, especially when delivered by the male lead which does not know how to act for his life.\nThe reason this does not get a lower score is because the soundtrack was decent and the female lead actually made an effort.", "Classic, classic, classic!! I loved this show from episode one!! Though towards the ending, it wasn't as good as the first episodes, it was still funny and interesting. Well, the story is a mess at the beginning, but it gets better after the third episode and the humour is good enough to keep you entertained. The romance is so cute, as the chemistry between the two leading roles is great. You can sense it from the beginning that those two are either going to kill each other or fall in love. And they almost do kill each other! The side stories weren't that great, as they were there only to fill the gap between the scenes and they merely helped the development of the story. The performances were good as well (well, most of them) and I liked the development of the characters, as they changed each other gradually.

There's really no other way to describe it.If you've spent some time watching Korean television (as I have), you know their dramas tend to be overly melodramatic; that's OK if you don't lay it on too thick, however this series takes the melodrama factor to a level of absurdity I've rarely ever seen. The only reason I kept watching this train wreck is because the ludicrous story line and plot twists are just unbelievably hilarious.SPOILERS AHEAD!This show revolves around an orphaned boy who grows up seeking vengeance on the men who murdered his parents. While growing up, he becomes super rich and super skilled at all methods of mortal combat in order to get the revenge he deserves. As an adult, he goes by 3 different names; let's just call him 'God' shall we. He's supposed to be the super suave and smart man that can do no wrong, has it all, makes all the ladies swoon, etc. The only problem with this is the guy that plays him (don't know what his name is and don't care), well, he sucks as an actor (at least based on this show). He's supposed to be the strong and silent type of leading man, but instead comes across as a dim witted lunatic who often can't form complete sentences.\"God\" is also a legendary international assassin. How he has time to do this, while plotting revenge, training in deadly arts, pleasing the ladies, and running a billion dollar corporation, is beyond me, particularly so when it's obvious he spends most of his time styling his ridiculous hairdos. And, what is the international code name of this legendary killer? Of course, it's Peter Pan!...Brilliant!...I would have been reluctantly OK with this if it were just a throw away nickname, but, everybody in this series references it constantly\"'God' is Peter Pan?\"...\"Peter Pan is coming to get me?\"...\"Peter Pan is doing what?\", etc. It's simultaneously irritating and comical.The rest of the \"plot\" is an absolute mess; there are 3 girls in love with 'God' (despite the fact that he's a douche and a mass murderer with a severe multiple personality disorder). One of these girls is first loyal to 'God', then disloyal, then repeat. The second girl is irrelevant to the plot and is purely there for eye candy (she does have really nice legs though). The third girl is some wide eyed reporter who gets in the way of the revenge plot, and becomes the main love interest throughout this show; her and 'God\" somehow fall in love (which is absurd because they have absolutely nothing in common and zero chemistry). Her character is as dumb as a rock, and became more useless and annoying as this series dragged on.The \"best\" storyline involves the girl who wants to catch 'God'. She's a detective that was raised by a single father. Unbeknownst to her, she's also adopted, and is 'God's' younger sister. Her father was actually the henchman who worked for the dudes that murdered 'God's' parents years ago. The father was supposed to kill 'God's' entire family, but decided to save young 'God', and his sister, at the last second. Young 'God' was sent to an orphanage, and the father took 'God's' sister to replace his own dying daughter. 'God's' sister (who 'God' thought was dead), eventually grows up to be the detective who's hunting 'God'. The father considers revealing the truth years later, but he can't cause the main dude hunting 'God' glued his lips shut, killed him, and framed 'God' for the murder, so the detective ('God's' sister) would hunt and kill 'God'.This detective/sister plot is absurd enough as it is, but why stop there?...The illegitimate daughter of one of the evil dudes 'God' is chasing happens to be the same dingbat reporter that 'God' loves, which technically makes the \"eye candy girl\" her biological sister. The main dude hunting 'God' (it should be noted that he's an even worse actor than the lead character, if that's possible) is the son of one of the other evil dudes who's bound to a wheelchair, and he also happens to be in love with the reporter. The brother of the \"eye candy girl\" is in love with \"loyal/disloyal girl\", who's still in love with 'God', etc. This type of nonsense literally never ends!This show is breathtakingly out of control. I'm continually amazed at how many outrageous things this show can come up with; need a contract killer of the week?...bring in the guy that fights with a whip and poisonous add on nails, or the Geisha ninja, or the secretary self defense expert, or Pascal from Vegas (don't ask). Need the main love interest to reminisce about being with 'God'?...let's film her longingly looking at still production photos during their \"happy times\" together (nobody will notice that she couldn't possibly have these photos unless they were actually provided to her by the production team). Also, every main character involved with this show has endless chances to easily accomplish their goals, but they can't because they over complicate everything, make really bad decisions, and are just too stupid in general. And, on and on it goes! This show is so bad that I wouldn't have been surprised if the wheelchair bound dude stood up at some point to prance around a board meeting like a deranged Jiminy Cricket...Oh wait, that actually happens!Bottom Line: this show is unbelievably BAD! But, it's almost worth watching to see how bad it is. Almost! On a scale of 1 to 10, it gets 1 point to start with (because everything is worth something), 1 point for the abundant pretty ladies, and 1 point for the comically unintentional absurdity of it all. It gets no points for story, script, pacing, plot, writing, direction, acting.Final score: 3 out of 10, and, I think that's being kind. Watch this at your own risk!", "The best thing about this show was the story kept moving along, not as many filler dead spots as most Asian dramas.

The fights, reasoning, effects, etc. are a little low when compared with Western dramas. And, I did have to get past the braided mullet that the protagonist wears for most of the show, maybe a thing in Korea in 2010?I thought the ending was weak, which is very common for Asian dramas. Poor endings make it look like the writers and cast were suddenly told they had one episode left to wrap everything up with half the normal budget. Often, there is never a denouement following the climax.Overall I enjoyed it more than most Asian dramas, which I generally find a slow moving.

She works hard and dreams of becoming a top chef one day, but her life is soon turned upside down when an abrasive new head chef takes over the restaurant she works at and promptly makes everyone's lives miserable. The new chef (Hyun Wook) is a skilled yet demanding boss, and he's also a smug misogynistic prick who belittles everyone he comes across. Inexplicably, Yoo Kyung and Hyun Wook start to develop feelings for each other and soon begin a cautious relationship.From there, it's standard K-Drama fare that employs the mismatched budding romantic leads plot, along with two alternative love interests with their own back stories, and a host of side characters along the way. Just follow along with everyone's personal & professional lives to see where it all goes. It's the same pattern as always, only this show takes place in a kitchen/restaurant environment (instead of a hotel, hospital, etc.). PROSIt's Predictability: There is something to be said for how comfortably familiar these shows often are. It's like wearing your favorite old jeans or sweatshirt, or, perhaps a better analogy would be eating your favorite comfort food; If you're a regular viewer of these types of shows, you know exactly how this particular show is going to \"feel & taste\" right from the get go.Lead Actress: Gong Hyo Jin plays Yoo Kyung; she's become one of the go to actresses for these types of shows in recent years, and she's really good in general at playing the \"girl just trying to get by in life who stumbles into a romance\". However, this is not one of my favorite roles for her.The Food: DO NOT watch this show on an empty stomach!...There aren't many shows that consistently presents food on screen so exquisitely as this one does; we're talking hard core food porn here as this show often focuses on the kitchen chefs creating and producing one fantastic looking dish after another. It's mostly Italian cuisine, with some Korean flair mixed in, along with lobster, filet mignon, fine dining meals, entrees, various presentations, and so forth. And, of course, lots and lots of pasta. Everything looks absolutely delicious!Soundtrack: Nobody does TV show soundtracks & musical scores like KTV does, and I think this is one of the most regularly undervalued aspects of all of these shows. As usual, there are a half dozen recurring melodies or so that are utilized to suit the varying moods as needed throughout this show, plus (if I remember correctly) a couple of a KPop stars on hand to sing a duet or two as per norm. This is not my favorite OST by any means, but I don't know how many times I've watched these shows and thought \"that's a catchy & appropriate tune\", \"that's a nice song\", etc.Pacing: This show does keep everything moving along. There is some repetitiveness to it, but very little of the endless pauses and longing stares of people reminiscing about stuff that just happened. I have very little tolerance for that nonsense in my K-Dramas.Ending: It's (SPOILERS) no surprise that everybody lives \"happily ever after\" in some fashion or another by the time it all wraps up. CONSIt's Predictability: Yes, this is listed as one of the \"Pros\", but this cuts both ways. If you're hoping for anything out of the ordinary or unexpected to happen here, you can forget it. There is little doubt what will eventually happen to all the players involved by the middle of episode 2. It wouldn't hurt for a few more of these shows to try to be a little more diverse every now and then.Endless Over Acting: The main characters don't have to endure this too much, but almost all of the auxiliary characters are forced to over act to the point of buffoonery at times. Sometimes this is cute & effective, but it's simply annoying and obnoxious way more often than not.Lead Actor's character: This is by far the biggest problem with this show! The lead male chef character is played by Lee Sun Gyun. He represents the stern teacher figure type that supposed to grow and soften over time as the main love interest, but his evolution is so poorly executed that he rarely ever becomes even an acceptable person (much less a love interest character to root for). What woman in their right mind would want to be with this guy?...He's arrogant, stubborn, childish, condescending, verbally abusive, and offers little in the way of being a desirable mate. And, the stupid smirk he's always wearing on his face doesn't help matters any. By extension, the mere fact that Yoo Kyung actually likes this guy reflects very poorly on her character.Summary: It has its moments, and is by no means terrible, but the Cons often outweigh the Pros IMO. And, it's severely hampered by its choice to write the male lead character as they did; this guy is just way too much of a jerk for the viewer to identify with why the female lead character would ever like him in the first place. If this were real life, these 2 people would clearly be headed for a depressing relationship, or divorce, or worse, if they decided to be together long term. It would be one thing if this show were aiming for that type of future dismal outlook, but it's not; this is all somehow supposed to be romantic, and you're supposed to be persuaded that the male lead is just perfect for our female lead, and that everything will work out great between them in the end. I, however, think this show fails miserably at trying to accomplish that.Bottom Line: 6 out of 10 stars!", "\"Pasta\" is the first Korean drama I saw in Netflix (Hulu also offers a lot of Asian shows) attracted for the theme focusing in a restaurant and food. I enjoyed this show because I like learning about different cultures and after watching the first episode I was totally captured for the plot and the high quality of this production.\"Pasta\" is about a girl who wants to become a chef of an Italian restaurant in South Korea. At this point I should say that Korean dramas are very close related to Mexican soap operas but also have a lot of Manga elements. There is always a love story (many times a love triangle), a lot of comedy and, of course, a lot of drama. \"Pasta\" in particular has a lot of fun and you learn some cooking too. So far I have watched three Korean dramas and I noticed that they usually have between 16 to 20 episodes of one hour each. The only thing that could bother a little bit about Korean dramas to Americans is the way women are portrayed kind of passive, but seeing this behavior in the three shows I guess is part of the culture over there. I can recommend also \"You Are Beautiful\".", "This is hans down the best Korean Drama ever made its starts out slow and builds through out the 20 episode, the only KD that didn't get stale or repative.Learn the characters and let it breath"], "1050": ["Sweeping drama that weaves timeless issues throughout \u2013 friendship, love, loyalty, human dignity, good versus evil, during a time where slaves were crucial to life but considered the lowest rung of society.

His comrades, General Choi (Han Jung-soo) and Wang-son (Kim Ji-seok), acting as muscle and maid respectively, form a family.Dae-gil is haunted by his first love,former slave, Un-nyun (Lee Da- hae), who escaped with her brother 10 years ago when Dae-gil's family home was burned to the ground, to which Dae-gil was the lone survivor. Song Tae-ha (Oh Ji-ho) crosses paths with Dae-gil multiple times during the series and is a key to Dae-gil's first love, Un-nyun, story.

Yes there are lots of characters and it takes a while to sort it out, but the selfish power-hungry politicians play chess with all the characters you love (and hate). 3) Great villains - Hwang Chul-Woong (Lee Jong Hyuk) driven to hard core assassin by chess master Minister Lee (Kim Eung Soo). 4) Cutest kid ever, Crown Prince Seok-Kyeon (Kim Jin Woo). 5) Eop Bok's final stand was very satisfying. What I did not love: 1) Mid-way the series took a dark turn that was recoverable, but the shock was significant. 2) Tough to keep the political story characters straight and politicians are never nice people. 3) Who lives and who dies? Even though I'd might have made some changes, the retribution and redemption choices the writers made, rang true for the characters. 4) More of an epilog on the final episode to wrap the series up with a bow, much is left to your imagination.", "This drama is full of many thing.

With a budget in excess of 20 billion won (17 million USD), it, along with its spin-off Athena: Goddess of War, share the record for the most expensive Korean dramas ever produced. Premiering in October 2009, the series was a critical and commercial success, with an average viewership of over 30% in addition to ranking as the top program consistently every week after its debut. The series also took home many of the highest honors at the 2009 KBS Drama Acting Awards, including Byung-hun Lee winning the top recognition, the Daesang Award. Among other nominations and recognitions, Lee and Tae-hee Kim were also named as one of the best on-screen couples.\" My Review In One Breath: This series (20 episodes, 60 minutes each) concerns a National Security System agent who attempts to take down a secret organization. After the introductory opening episodes, the missions are similar to what one would find in the American \"24\" series (excluding the \"real time\" element), with agents attempting to stop terrorist attacks with the use of satellites and information support technicians. Of course, this is in the Korean style with some romance and melodrama blended in. Acting is top notch, with Byung-hun Lee in the lead role and a very good supporting cast: Tae-hee Kim (his love interest and fellow agent), Seung-woo Kim (a North Korean agent) and So-yeon Kim (as the gorgeous North Korean sniper). Production values are slick, the scoring is great at times, and the pacing is very fast for a K-drama with plenty of shootouts (a few of which are fantastic) and suspense. Storyline is clich\u00e9d but the secret organization is intriguing and represents a brilliant little twist on the North/South Korean conflict. Consequently, the relationships between the characters change significantly in exciting ways and the viewer will have an emotional investment in the protagonists. Highly addictive stuff.", "NOTE: This review has been edited as of 10/08/18.Iris is 20 episode Korean TV show that aired in 2009. It's your basic Korean melodramatic TV series format, only it's infused with a significant amount of action & intrigue. Iris 2 (Iris II, Iris; New Generation) is its second/follow up season, which was also 20 episodes, but it didn't air until 2013.SPOILERS AHEAD!I had originally written 2 separate reviews years ago for this show/series, because IMDB originally listed them as 2 different shows. Since then, IMDB has apparently merged the original Iris page and the Iris 2 page together, so I'll do my best to merge my two original reviews together here under one review for both \"shows/seasons\".Iris (Season 1) was a unique show in Korea when it aired. The idea behind it, was to get some guys who like action/spy/intrigue flicks to also tune into a TV genre almost exclusively geared to attracting female viewers by nature. They spent a fortune making this show (by KTV standards at the time), and it shows; production values are through the roof, various exotic locales are visited, there's some terrific cinematography, blazing gunfights, action scenes, etc.Viewers loved it immediately (as did I), and it's easy to see why; it's often a riveting television series that is hard to look away from! And, Judging by the show's super high nationwide ratings (nearly 40% of all Korean TV viewers were watching this show by the time it wrapped up), I'd say the producers accomplished their goal and then some. Iris was a massive success by KTV standards that soon spawned a spin-off show (Athena), a movie (which was just an edited version of the TV show), talks of a second season (which only rarely happens in this medium), and so forth.The closest comparison to this show for western audiences is the American TV series \"24\", and that's a fair analogy, as they do share many similarities. Here's your story: Two marine friends get recruited by the NIS (basically the South Korean equivalent of the U.S. CIA/NSA). While there, they meet the primary love interest who is their section chief responsible for training them. The 2 friends quickly take to their new jobs as secret agents, and are soon deployed in the field. Things go wrong when they are sent on an important mission though, and they discover they're mere pawns in a much bigger picture.After the botched mission by the 2 friends/leads, this show boils down to a matter of uncovering what everybody's motives are, who's working for whom, and trying to stop the world from blowing up. Along the way, there's your main love interest story line, the main friendship story line, and so forth.What cannot be understated is that this show is, at its core, a soap opera. It's a high octane soap opera indeed, but a soap opera nonetheless. I've seen a ton of Korean melodrama shows/series over the years, some of which tried their best to have these \"soap operas\" reach an audience that includes EVERYBODY (males/females, Koreans/foreigners, action fans/love story fans, etc.), and this is one of those rare shows that actually accomplishes this fairly well.Iris (Season 1) is very entertaining and highly watchable. I gave it 8 out of 10 stars in my initial rating, and I stand by that.\n \nAs for Iris 2 (i.e. Season 2). Very disappointing for several reasons. I see some reviewers think it's better than the original, however they are wrong, and I'll now explain why: Iris 2 is greatly hampered by two overriding factors: 1) It's just more of the same with a weaker story and less prominent actors, and, 2) The show producers missed the window to capitalize on the popularity of the original show/1st season, by delaying its production for nearly 4 years.Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of the actors/actresses in Season 2, and they performed well overall, but the story and writing is lacking in general compared to the first season. In addition, everything seems rushed and tacked on (and/or poorly thought out), in what appears to be a last ditch effort to just cobble something together to put on TV and bring this show/series to a close. Part of the problem is because there was a bunch of hemming and hawing FOREVER about how to write and budget for a new season, along with trying to negotiate and sign up much of the original cast (despite the fact that, SPOILERS, most of their characters died or \"were disappeared\" at the end of the original show), and so on. As a result, Iris season 2 turned out to be a hodgepodge mess that was just \"too lacking, too little, too late\". There are a couple of cast members in Iris 2 that are back from the original, but they're mostly all supporting roles that are non-essential and/or are under-utilized. There's also several new tie-in characters related to characters from the 1st season, but none of these prior cast members or new \"related characters\" really fit well within the overall story. And, I cannot forgive the fact that they cast some English speaking dude as the main evil guy. No offense to him as an actor or person, and I understand they're trying to be more \"globally receptive\" by speaking English some, but this role should have been given to someone fluent in Korean; the resulting \"forced\" English dialogue between him and some of the Korean actors/actresses is often distracting, and prevents the Korean actors/actresses from acting at their best (since they have to use a foreign/second language in some crucial scenes with him).Iris 2 (Iris, Season 2) is not very good when compared to its forerunner. I originally gave it 5 out of 10 stars, and I stand by that. Bottom Line: 8 out of 10 stars (for Iris 1 ONLY). As for Iris 2, hmmm, watch Athena; Goddess of War instead!", "Iris was a serious South Korean spy thriller, with interesting plot twists, engaging performances, and several brutal betrayals, culminating in a finish that resulted in more than a few questions remaining unanswered. Promising to answer some of questions raised, Iris 2 is a show that had enormous shoes to fill, and unfortunately, its feet do not match the ambitious size of the original. Though one might imagine the sheer number of story-lines would make for a wealth of material, several aspects of the plot are tirelessly dragged out, obviously in the show's desperate attempt to reach 20 hour long episodes. Often predictable, with minimal character back-story, and a plot held together at the seams with sticky tape, the conflicting and often contradictory story-lines risk the production falling apart at a moment's notice.However, if you look past the flaws, there are a number of notable reasons why this show deserves a look, not least of all, the poignancy that is efficaciously delivered by the writers, alongside the talented (and VERY attractive) actors. This is heightened by the amazing musical score, including the gorgeous song from Davichi. Several of the fight sequences are sure to impress, though at the same time, those familiar with the aforementioned original, or even Athena, will see a great number of similarities, alongside the addendum that their frenetic orchestration can make them hard to follow.Furthermore, though some of the dialogue could be accused of immaturity, the chemistry and interactions between the characters prove to be engaging in themselves, the romantic and familial relationships being conceived with much emotion, while some of the witticisms are especially enjoyable. Though the show is often unrealistic, with characters severely injured in one episode, and running around during the next, alongside contradictions in the story-lines, and ideas that fail to be fleshed out, Iris 2 gradually finds its footing towards the end, resulting in an emotionally powerful and worth-while finale.Jung Yoo-Gun (Jang Hyuk) and paramour Ji Soo-Yeon (Lee Da-Hae) work together for the NSS, under the authority of deputy-director Choi Min (Oh Yeon-Su), who is determined to rid the world of Iris. Her goals however, are continuously been undermined by the ambitious Kang Cheol-Hwan (Kam Il-Woo), who seeks control of the agency, though his allegiances are unclear. When an Iris cell, led by Rey (David McInnis), storms the NSS prison housing the agency's former director Baek San (Kim Young-Chul), and extricates him in an attempt to garner much needed information, it becomes clear that Baek San has an important role to play in the war against the terrorist group. When North Korean traitor Yoo Joong-Woo (Lee Beom-Soo), a man desperate to clear his name, is recruited by Iris agent Kim Yeon-Hwa (Lim Soo-Hyang) to assist with her mission, tensions between the North and the South begin to escalate, and threaten the inevitable commencement of a unification war.With the sheer number of cast members, it is no surprise that some are provided significantly less screen time than others, with fellow NSS agents See Hyun-Woo (Yoon Doo-Joon) and Yoon-Shi Hyuk (Lee Joon), alongside Iris operative Park Tae-Hee (Yoon So-Yi), being difficult to associate with due to the significantly lacking characterization. Set over the course of more than a year, Iris 2 includes not only locations throughout South Korea, but internationally as well, which involve a car chase through the streets of Hungary, and a chase sequence on the ski slopes of Japan. When in its home nation, the shoot-outs often occur in warehouses, amongst other abandoned and condemned locations, which offer little in the way of uniqueness.Moving on, it's a fact, in every production, the antagonist is defeated. However, what's most important is not only how, but what horrors they have in store for the heroes. In short, how impressive a villain are they? The monotonous repetition of failure that consumes the enemy organization with every turn they take however, only makes their defeat all the more inevitable. To add insult to injury, the enemy group, Iris, have no motive or agenda, and without a cause, the audience is unable to connect with them on any level. If ever a cause was mentioned, it must have been whispered, for this viewer certainly never heard it.The lacking interest in the terrorist cell is heightened by the show's inability to continuously hold us in suspense. Even the threat of a third world war, despite the emotional performances by the actors, flat-lines in its ability to make us legitimately believe this may in fact come to fruition. However, where the show excels, is its ability to captivate the audience with its character relationships. Unlike American shows, that often drag out romances to the point of utter boredom, Iris 2 gives its viewers enough tension, poignancy, grief and hope, to keep us entrenched for the entirety of the season. Moreover, though antagonists are loathed by the audience at times, on other occasions, they are equally sympathetic. Although the acting could occasionally be accused of being a little too melodramatic, one cannot ever deny the potency, with more than a few moments having the capacity to bring a tear, or more.In conclusion, Iris 2 is best watched in moderation, and despite the occasional complexity of the stories, the show is very easy to follow. Despite been an enjoyable experience, Iris 2 is not a show that will cause you to continuously reminisce over the story-lines or characters. The show's conclusion leaves the Iris franchise open for a sequel, with a number of plots left unresolved, and several character stories requiring a more definitive close, though whether a third installment will occur, remains to be seen.", "A stunning miniseries from South Korea about the 'NSS' (the South Korean Secret Service). Pardon me if I struggle with the character (or actor) names, but several performances are quite stunning. Character-development and -relationships are superb, irony occurs frequently, and there's plenty of action to match the slower sweet scenes showing the developing love-story between Choi Seung-Hee, the pretty female Service leader, and Kim Hyun-Jun, a stud recruit to the spy service. Talk about star-crossed lovers! They get separated, find each other, and then lose track of the existence of each other for months, but only after some very near connections. It's one of those: 'HEY! HEY! Look to your right - she's still alive... HEY! HEY.. Oh No..!' Unexpected sentimental stuff when you are are watching a cold-hearted spy & intrigue show.IRIS also features a 'cross-over' character {that's a term I invented, by the way, so credit me if you use it!}: a character who switches sides, for some reason, to aid the protagonist. Example: the cowboy who breaks free from the wealthy townfolk in 'SHANE' and rides out to warn SHANE about the pending ambush. In IRIS, it's a pretty North Korean agent who falls out of favor with her bosses, and joins Hyun-Jun in his quest to get to the bottom of this IRIS conspiracy (after a few attempts to kill him, of course).Also in the show is one of those super-assassin types, whose imminent presence is signaled by the camera focusing on his distinctive cowboy boots. Lots of fist-fights and shoot-em-ups to go with some well-staged car chases. Plenty of double-crosses and plot twists. It has everything U.S. network primetime action shows DON'T have. Like I said, run -- don't walk - to tune this thing in. I am writing this in early December: if you have down-time this month, add IRIS to the mini-series that will dominate your time, instead of clearing snow.", "After watching this one, I felt like that all of James Bond movies are rubbish. Both either its casting or its stories quality! I herewith highly recommend IMDb's audience to watch it and understand its story line, then you'll understand why I wrote this. Truly I've underestimated Korean movie before I watched this one, and some others. The actors and actresses are as well mostly highly and well educated from certain universities, so they proved their quality doing their job.", "Watch this after Mr Sunshine. Iris is no compare to Mr Sunshine. But given its huge investment and foreign settings, it is worthwhile to have a look.Personally i dislike the look and temperament of the female lead. A young and musuline LBH is however the biggest magnet to me. So no matter what i will finish the drama.", "A fine series with A-List actors, but with a completely irresponsible ending. Shame on the writer and producer.", "Review of Season One:IRIS was a massively popular South Korean TV series that took the form of a spy thriller. The film focuses equally on explosive and fast-paced action sequences along with numerous and complex character interactions along the way. I watched the first season of the show, which comprises of twenty episodes centred around Lee Byung-hun's put-upon lead character. The story jumps into the thick of the action from the word go and remains fast paced throughout, although I did think twenty episodes were a few too many. What surprised me was just how low budget the show feels. The requirement to stage regular fight scenes every episode means that the production has a cheap digital look at times, and one two or there bits of music which are repeated over and over again throughout the twenty episodes (pulse-pounding music during the action bits, a cheesy song during the romantic scenes). There is padding and there is melodrama and romance, but generally this is watchable, exciting fare. The director makes the most of his star's matinee idol looks and there are so many twists that you quickly lose count of them amid the mayhem. Think of a Korean version of 24 or SPOOKS and you'll be close, but IRIS is very much a product of its own nation and as such has a voice all its own.", "As the title says: Don't expect this show to be '24'. It is not nearly as good as the adventures of Jack Bauer. 'IRIS' is thematically similar, which invites the comparison, but falls short in its execution. While the South Korean setting has some fantastic potential with the friction between the North and the South, 'IRIS' clearly doesn't succeed in making the most of it.The show is often quite cheesy, and at the same time stylized, while at times looking like a cheap soap opera. The annoying hand-held camera work with lightning-fast cuts is also very tiring, as are some of the quite ridiculous story lines and huge plot-holes and deus ex machinas.Nevertheless, I'd be lying, though, if I denied that it was entertaining at times. Sure, you have to suspend your disbelief a lot and also be willing to overlook loads of huge flaws, but if you do, there will be some very decent scenes. I had to force myself a bit to sit through the entirety of season 1, and while I wouldn't necessarily recommend 'IRIS' to friends, I wouldn't say I completely wasted my time watching it.", "Too much drama, too much whimpering, too many close-ups, too many tiring zoom-in, too many onion tears, too many sad love songs, lame directing and acting, too long. So disappointing. Some real good actors though but the show is not up the expectations...", "But in 24 as far i recall, you never saw Kiefer Sutherland crying. This has some great action sequences. It also spends more time on the romance angle than 24 would.ut it also has moments of which didn't cut it with me (1) When Kim Sun Hwa is shooting at Kim Hyun Joon she's not really a very good shot is she. As a matter of fact, a lot of people who tried to kill him are very bad shots (2) the reason for the main character to gang up with the terrorists and attack NSS seemed weak. They had nothing to do with what happened to him. That was IRIS. Is there something I've forgotten. (3) The final confrontion between Vick and Kim Hyun Joon, More should have made on how Kim got into the place. As a matter of fact, i thought that Vick would have made sure that no one was following him. Assuming that Kim was just too smart for him, you would imagine Vick have had lots of alarms in his place. So there should have been a sequence showing Kim getting into the building. Then when he has the opportunity to kill him, or take him in, he decides to throw his gun away and kick the you know what out of him. Not only that, he leaves the gun conveniently near for Vick to attempt to kill him. (4) The confrontation where the s.w,a.t team leader pulls a gun on Kim. That was just too silly. (5) The hostages disguised as terrorists. Well kim, and san wee were plainly being fired at. So unless a quick bit of hypnotism was done on the hostages to make them believe they really were terrorists, I don't understand why they would fire on them. my favourite character was the north korean female agent Kim Sun Hwa. She was serious mode most of the time. But on the few occasions, she did smile, it was lovely to see. My least favourite was the section chief. Where all of the other acting was minimilist, he went in the other direction. I liked him at first, but then his over the top expressions weren't to my liking. So why after all my complaints, do i rate the series so highly. Well, it's compelling. it keeps you on your toes. you want to know what's gonna happen. That's a big plus. I would like to see some of these actors (i include the ladies) in other stuff, because i found it hard to gauge just how well they can act.my favourite scene is where the section chief and others come to Choi Seung Hee's house on her birthday. But they find her in a very bad way. I just liked the way it changed from light to dark", "This has the same issue as every Korean television shows and movies - terrible writing. Fire your writers, get better writers.Doesn't matter what you do from beginning to middle - if the ending is horrible, the entire movie or television show is horrible.Learn to write good stories Korea.", "Iris 2 9/10 Terrific. This for me is better than the original. I found myself questioning it less than that. Section chief Oh is not irrating, as I found him in the original. Jang Hyuk is excellent as the damaged (aren't they all) agent. But all of the cast turn in good performances particularly Lee Da-Hae as the love interest. There are quite a lot of hand to hand combat scenes. Some better than others. The best one for me is between Lim Soo-Hyang) Yoon So-Yi. There also some nice comedy moments, particularly a howlingy funny sequence involving a gangster/arms dealer. Well he's listed on Asian wiki as arms dealer. But he came across as more of a gangster to me. Park sang wook is great in what is basically a cameo role as the aforementioned. The story for me is tighter than in the original. There's also a nice cameo at the end from.. Well I won't say who. But the sequence ends with two women showing a bunch of guys that you can;t put a good woman down, or a bad one for that matter. It made me think \"Oh, those two should have their own series together\" But it would me more lighthearted than iris; maybe as two female private eyes :) sequences that made me go \"hmmm\" It is obvious when Park Tae Hee how Park Tae Hee dealt so easily with iris agents, how good she was. Yet only two are sent to tail her afterwords. At least one great snow chase scene. Was there two, I can't remember. Some great fashion too, particularly Lee Da Hae's trench coat, and Oh Yeon-Su white outfit. Then there is Lee Da Hae's great walk, when she enters her place of work, and the sound of her shoes. I also liked the music.", "Towards the end of this show, I found myself saying what more and more. This is not my first k- drama, but this is definitely one of the most disappointing shows I've ever watched. It seemed to have so much potential that all just fell flat in the final, crucial episodes of the series which made me even more confused as to why it was so highly praised and rated by everyone. I'm now wondering if we even watched the same show. Honestly, if you are going to watch this show, be prepared to be frustrated at the end.****************CONTAINS SPOILERS*************************First off, the beginning, although slow to some viewers, showed lots of promise. There were so many great opportunities that were set up and there were good characters, a lot of good twists and turns as the series continued, I could almost overlook the constant shaky cam., the choppy editing, and the odd direction. However, the show peaked around episode 15 or so and then rapidly declined at the end. The main failings were the plot, which became pretty convoluted towards the end, the lack of resolution of major plot points and the subsequent forgetting/absence of said plot points, and the plot holes that require you to suspend your disbelief and logic in order to follow what's going on and have it make sense. Then there is the final ending scene. I mean really, after watching all that they end the series with a major death that comes out of literally nowhere...I know apparently there were some issues with Lee Byun Hyun not wanting to continue with the series, but at least write off his character in a convincing way that actually makes sense in the context of the story. How are more people not upset with this? I understand that this was a tragic show and people died, but it seemed as though they wrapped up the main plot of the story, and LBH and KTH were going to get their happily ever after....except just kidding, he gets mysteriously shot and the show ends with no explanation whatsoever. That is not a befitting ending for the characters and his death was not set up at all and seemed to be a quick fix to the LBH issue and a chance to get in one last death for shock value.Giving this five stars because the plot was good towards the beginning and had some good performances in the lead roles.", "After a few months even I'm crying after the time wasted to see this stuff. A mixture of (what?): body lotion, scented hair gel, some uranium, french perfumes, goulash, absurd stunts, syrupy kisses, whatever. Strong cut scenes (being imperfect anyway), lustrous actors, the feeling that they come from marketplace at their headquarter, fashion parade at the end of the series , unbelievable acts, a Kim Tae-he looking towards nowhere in many crucial points. What? A nuclear attempt? With the most unbelievable pretext? What a joke! All the series seems a huge, monumental joke; of bad taste. The actor Lee Byung-Hun is blank as always. For me, he never rises to convey an extraordinary state of life. Only the actor Jeong Jun-Ho saved a bit this messed movie. And actress Kim So-Yeon, yep, she really performed OK. I have all my respect for art and the work in movies but we are here, this years 2000 plus and this movie has not a valid message.", "The series was good for the most part but the ending was terrible.

They seemed to be hot-tempered so often rival groups of boys and girls were engaged in fighting. The hero was a playboy and the heroine was a female gang-leader. At some particular scenes it has portrayed landscape of village which was eye-soothing. And the soundtrack was also good. The lead actors and actresses did their best but continuous sanguinary fighting and conflict just for \"my girl\" and other tiny issues was not adorable to me. Severe punishment of immorality was also expected. However sometimes this movie managed to uphold teenage psychology which involves the reluctance to follow the straight path and courteous manner for having \"hot young blood\" . It's got a subtle similarity with another box-office hit Korean movie \"Sunny (2011)\" - both the movie focused on the same period and clashes among hot-tempered teenage people yet \" Sunny\" was a movie involving much deeper emotion and friendship. And I believe, most of the teenagers even in today's restless society don't possess such hot blood and they are more considerate in cherishing friendship to lead a better future rather than creating such enmity among them! :) .", "This is a movie that has a little bit of something for everyone. At least to the Korean audiences or people that know of Korean lifestyle and cultures. But it just won't appeal to every audiences. It's basically about the life of few high schooler's during the 1980's without it having a set direction. It does somewhat come together near the end. But it's a movie that shows what Korean countryside high schoolers dealt with during the 1980's. And it has a love triangle going on which is the core of the story (which I think a lot of Korean audiences like, since it's a formula that isn't getting old seeing how majority of the Korean dramas are like that), a bit of high school rivalry and bullying going on. It really isn't a gripping movie or anything like that and the story is actually quite slow since there isn't really a set direction. But audiences that want to see high school relationships and how they deal with dysfunctional families might enjoy or at least appreciate this flick. I gotta admit there was few parts that I thought had some emotion and heart to it. And I thought the smooth and clean cinematography of the countryside was refreshing to watch, especially the intro. When it comes to the cast, they were alright. Except the female lead who I thought was a miscast, mainly because I just couldn't buy her being a leader of a high school gang or this tough girl. Lee Jong-Suk plays Joong-Gil who is this sleazy playboy that tries to be flirtatious with every female classmate. Now I am not a fan of Lee Jong-Suk, but I was impressed with his performance in this. I am not sure if it's because he was playing a bit of himself like Justin Timberlake to \"The Social Network\". But the way he portrayed his character was extremely believable to the mannerisms, to the way he says his dialogues to the movements.

And if you look at how Hollywood keeps milking the same predictable plots over and over again, its just a disgusting thing to say. I loved Lucid Dream a lot! Keep up the great work Korea, you are on the right track. I hope I can start watching these refreshing Korean movies in European theaters 1 day.", "Absolutely nonsense but entertaining nonetheless, \"Lucid Dream\" takes a not very original idea (what is real, what is not, can we get into our dreams...) and decides to take a page of the action book. The result is an average movie, which repeats itself too much, but is saved, however, but good acting and a pace that doesn't slow down.Dae-ho sees his son kidnapped in an amusement park. He thinks the culprit is someone that must have a grudge against him, because of his work as an investigative journalist. But, when more than three years pass and he is unable to find a clue about the whereabouts of his son or even if he is dead or alive, Dae-ho decides to ask for the help of a friend and try to find clues in his own dreams, in a state of lucid dreaming.What follows makes no sense whatsoever. The basis of the plot, the lucid dreams and our hero remembering from his own, is as thin as it comes, and it never sells the idea that it could be a real possibility. However, as Dae-ho, Soo Go sells us the character and his plight. And the direction by Kim Joon-Sung is flashy enough to entertaining the viewer and make us forgive the shortcomings of the movie.All in all, it is an entertaining time in front of the screen, but empty fun.", "I'm really amazed and impressed with the consistency and the quality of many of the Korean films that I've seen. I'm no expert, that's for sure, but you can tell that they really put a LOT of effort into creating an excellent, involving story. The acting, alone, is WAY above the average American film (and I happen to have been raised by and live near San Diego :)This primarily is a Police Procedural about a father looking for his kidnapped child, but it has some nice, low-key, Science Fiction touches that are integral to the story. You can likely guess what some of these are by the title of the film. But, what I was most impressed by was just how well done the movie was. It honestly kept me in suspense and did an excellent job in maintaining that tension throughout the entire film.I read one external review where they dismissed this movie as a poor copy of another really well known (and quite excellent) film. I won't mention the title of it because I don't want to give too much away. But, I very much disagree with that reviewer because as masterful and stunning as the other film is that he was referring too, I truly feel that a movie should be judged on it's own as to how well it is put together and based upon the quality of it's story, direction, acting, etc. And, this one I felt was actually quite good. It's not a Sci Fi Blockbuster by any means, so please don't expect 'TRANSFORMERS'-like effects and such. No, this is mainly a powerful Police Drama along with an excellent Mystery as to what has happened to the child. Add in the nice Sci Fi elements that propel the story and I feel that you have a very entertaining movie that does an excellent job in involving the audience in not only the search for the man's son, but also the intriguing twists and turns that reveal themselves as time goes on.If you like a good Police Drama / Thriller and also enjoy some light Sci Fi elements woven into the story, I think that there is a good chance that you might enjoy this film.", "When normally I watch a movie , I set my personal opinion about it based on my sleep meter, If I feel sleep while I am watching it or I could survive till the end? even-though I went slept the first day , I played the movie next day, but I did not Like the movie for the story line originality, the idea its not new, you if you watch it you clearly will guess the movie is another version of watch.

I was pretty much blown away by this series, why? Firstly acting here is superb, Ji Sung (or Ji Seong) in main role plays orphan who wants to make his way up from scum to success and live a better life. I can't understand why isn't he amazingly popular actor already, his acting was really convincing and he is also good looking fellow, which probably ain't bad thing when it comes to becoming popular either. Also gotta mention Sung Yu Ri (or Seong Yoo ri), who also makes marvelous role here as a girl with a dream and is just damn beautiful too. Rest of the cast also does great job, if I'd had to mention someone else besides ones above, it gotta be Jun Kwang Ryul (or Jeon Gwang Ryeol), who makes great role as bitter and heartless old man. As story goes on motives and ambitions of characters change, so it isn't just some simple story about thug who isn't happy with his life and wants money and success.Secondly plot is really nice and complex and there's some action in it too, it's really not basic romance drama. Thirdly Characters are also likable, drama really kept me interested all ~25 hours and music played in drama are also just brilliant. \"TRAX + Air\" really has made awesome job with two of their songs that played during series.

Especially the final episode was aimless, as the story had already concluded a few episodes ago. The romance got tiring and bleak as well.

She was really adorable being a girl who fall in love with Shin Hwal, her (ex) step-brother.Shin Hwal played by Lee Jung Jae is undeniably perfect. To be honest, his acting has saved most of the story and script. Other actors, had played their roles real well, in my opinion but Hana Lee's role as estranged wife of Shin Hwal has unfortunately drain my energy while watching. Her character is so lifeless even with all the problems she had going.Couldn't help but make the comparison between Triple and Coffee Prince. My take is that there's too many depressing moments and not much breather in between.

The story builds from one crazy scene to another that's gets the main character in more and more hot water as the show progresses.

A must for her fans."], "1094": ["Fassbinder's Berlin Alexanderplatz (1980) was a long movie - over 15 hours long. The Thornbirds, Roots and other early TV mini-series were long movies broken into consecutive episodes. I love a mini-series as a melodrama that tells a story in the long movie format, as opposed to those that tell different stories in the same setting (like Grey's Anatomy, Mad Men and to a lesser extent Damages, Breaking Bad, and Revenge that change the story at times while keeping to a general story). In this regard, I have discovered some gems in the South Korean TV mini-series of recent years.The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back. This me recur in the same story. Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved. If personality dynamics are properly depicted in a valid manner, and if the production is skillful, powerful emotions can be evoked in the viewer. In this way we can live many lifetimes through movies, in our one lifetime - greatly enriching our incarnate experience.These South Korean productions (seen on Netflix streaming) are first class with excellent production and direction, some terrific casting and acting (particularly from some of the females who give some matchless world class performances), brilliant musical accompaniment, and staging. What makes these so good is the way they skillfully evoke deep emotion in the viewer. South Korean movie making is superb - world class.However, the following caveats must be considered by the USA viewer. They are subtitled and some people hate this. The South Korean cultural norms, values and sanctions may sometimes seems silly or old fashioned to the USA viewer. The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation/unity - sometimes reminiscence of a old Frank Capra film.Most importantly, in order for the sometimes complicated sub-plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing, and this leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people, that sometimes seem to be unlikely by USA cultural standards. The viewer may wonder at times why good but trusting people are so easily manipulated and deceived by bad and selfish people, but con artists do often succeed (just look at politicians for example). However this poetic license of improbability is needed to develop the story - just accept it as occurring even though unlikely at times. Taking these factors into account Will help you become involved and emotionally engrossed. It was hard t for me to quit watching at times so I binged watched.I would rank these as follows but tastes differ and your rankings might not agree: 1 - 4 (hard to say which is best)Shining InheritanceWhen a Man LovesThat Winter, The Wind BlowsSecret Garden5. Five Fingers6. The Scent of a Woman7. The Great Queen Seondeok8. A Hundred Years Inheritance9. Lie To me10. Roof Top Prince11. Dr. Jin12. The Great DoctorShining inheritance is about family, love, greed, deceit, manipulation, altruism, and other dynamics important in the pursuit of happiness. It is nicely paced over 28 episodes, in fully developing the story, but the viewer must stick with it at least halfway to get the full emotional impact of the story. Perhaps more coherent than other of the above mini-series, it could be your favorite.", "Just finished watching this drama, although it's dated it's still worth a watch if you are watching Korean TV drama. I saw past reviews and it compared this show to current US drama. This is much different this show is warm, chilling and frightening at the same time. I can't believe that there are people in the world like this.This is s family drama unlike current shows on mainstream TV where \"coitus\" is in every sentence. This is different a family show that's is very emotional. Well acted, well written (a bit long). The first episode is a bit confusing as the characters are not clearly explained but stick with it, gets better with each episode.Even if you think you are not an emotional person, it's hard not to be with this show, even the music is touching and I don't even know the words. If you watch this show and don't feel sad along the way then If you are into Korean TV drama I would say that this rates very high among those I have watched, but I have a long list to get through. Although I would rate \"That Fool\" at the top of my list.As well the main actress is enough of a reason to watch the show, if you ever wanted to picture an \"angel\" she is it. I first saw her in a movie 'Cold Eyes' and I thought she was beautiful. But in this drama she is beyond that. A picture of an Angel with a smile that's warm and sincere.SPOILER ALERT: The show is a bit long seems as though that the writers wanted everyone (main cast) to have some hardship before the end, which is predictable happens. Although the end is a bit different than the other shows that I have watched (in other shows:everyone goes off on their own in the end). This show is different as it brings/intertwines all the cast into situations that are semi-realistic. But I thought that the \"witch\" and the \"witchette\" got of way too easy.

This was nice to watch but in my opinion, 28 episodes was too long. Sometimes by my own admittance I can have a short time span unless the story is really rivetting. Although the storyline had a good premise, I quite couldn't agree with the ending and therefore slightly disappointed. Unless there are Koreans out there can guide me, I'm from the UK, but I find, taking into account they are fictional stories but with a sense of how your culture is coming across to a westerner, alittle proud, sometimes harsh, humourous (a bit like ours) and seem to go by honour. Going back to this drama, for me thought the way the step daughter was treated in the end was quite harsh, a bit of compassion wouldn't have come amiss. Mother was a nightmare so can understand the characters turning against her. Was disappointed the daughter didn't end up with the restaurant guy, he's so sweet and lovely. The grandson's character was not very attractive at all, in real life he'd be someone I wouldn't touch with a bargepole! Lol. Well acted by everyone.", "Shining Inheritance was a riches to rags to find-yourself drama that was well written and acted. Our heroine is plucky, the stepmother / stepdaughter are quite the evil pair and our male leads, the rich heir (starts spoiled and evolves) and selfless friend, are both worthy of love. The Grandmother, who has the inheritance, shakes up her sheltered spoiled family when she strips them of money to teach them about life. What I liked about the show a) writer So Hyun-kyung crafted 28 episodes of interwoven characters with surprises along the way. His evil characters had nuances. He also wrote the top-notch intriguing 49 Days (2011 kdrama) that I rate as better than Shining Inheritance. b) male lead Lee Seung-gi as heir Hwan, in his first male lead role, whose evolution from spoiled heir to caring person was a joy to watch. I also loved him as the male lead in 2010's My Girlfriend is Gumiho. c) Yeon Joon-seok as autistic brother Go Eun-woo was perfect and you rooted for him to be reunited with big sister. d) loved store Manager Lee who was terse but fair and put up with Hwan's initially hostile reluctance to do his job with patient dignity.What I did not like about the show a) this drama was extended by 4 episodes and you can feel the storyline stretch. I bet is difficult for a writer to revamp during production when a drama is extended because it is garnering great ratings. b) the evil stepmother, while nuanced, grated on me and I tended to skip her scenes to alleviate the irritation. c) multiple hairstyle-challenged characters; female lead Go Eun-sung mushroom cap pageboy hair bugged me. She looked so much better with the bangs off the face. The Grandmother character had a terrible helmet-head gray wig and don't get me started on the factory worker with the gray pageboy wig.", "I enjoyed Brilliant Legacy aka Shining Inheritance very much.

Moon Geun Young in a nice lovely role.", "Amazing cinematography, great directing, beautiful costumes, poignant soundtracks, impeccable acting, heartwarming plot.....and the list goes on. Words cannot describe how impressed I am towards this Korean historical drama. The reason why I did not rate this drama as a perfect 10, is because it has a rushed and messy ending. However, I am still incredibly amazed and blown-away by this drama. The drama is based on a novel of the same title, which centers around the life of real-life historical painter Shin Yun Bok(portrayed by Moon Geun Young). There is a twist in the novel/drama: Shin Yun Bok is actually a girl in disguise as a boy in order to enter the Royal Painting bureau. Moon Geun Young has done an impeccable job in portraying SYB. If I had not known that Moon Geun Young is actually an actress, I would have mistaken her for an actor!!!!! Her acting is top-notch; she delivered every speech and action perfectly. She gave the character SYB life and the character remains alive in my heart even until now. Therefore, Moon Geun Young has become one of my favorite actresses in no time. The chemistry between the cast is good, however, I reckon that Moon Geun Young and actress Moon Chae Won(who portrayed Jeong-Hyang) had the BEST chemistry in the drama. Being confused with her sexuality, Shin Yun Bok fell in love with the musically-gifted Gisaeng Jeong- Hyang. Whenever both characters appear on-screen together, their intense chemistry is apparent. When both characters have eye contact, it is as if a thousand sparks had exchanged between their eyes. Their interactions were incredibly precious and unique. I had hoped that they would have more interactions in the drama. Besides the acting, the cinematography and writing are fantastic. The writer, together with the director, masterfully incorporated the famous paintings of painter Shin Yun Bok into the plot. The paintings came to life, literally. Being a lover of paintings, I am absolutely in love with how paintings were woven into the storyline of the drama and how the paintings were drawn from scratch(professional painters were hired in the drama to replicate the paintings). I am incredibly mind-blown by the beautiful cinematography skills. The plot is very exciting and I had to watch episodes back-to-back. The plot twists never failed to surprise me, leaving me in a state of awe and disbelief. There were some awesome scenes which were unique to the drama, which I adored greatly. I found the drama very heartwarming, some parts were heartbreaking, even. Ah, the amazing and lovely soundtracks that were played throughout the drama had complemented every scene perfectly. I was hugely impacted by the songs and I adore them immensely. I could not stop humming the songs to myself even after completing the drama. Memories of the drama never fail to flood back into my mind whenever I hear the soundtracks, leaving me feeling poignant. The soundtracks of Painter of the Wind remain as one of my favorite Korean drama soundtracks. Therefore, Painter of the Wind is an enjoyable drama to watch. It showcases many aspects of the Arts as well as relationships between people. The drama is just BEAUTIFUL."], "1130": [], "1131": ["Hong Kong gambling flicks go in and out of fashion, but the genre is relatively new in South Korean cinema, and TAJJA can be extraordinarily entertaining. TAJJA has style to burn, and from the very start, there's flashbacks, split-screens, hyperbolic action, and the expected doses of melodrama in the story of a young gambler's rise to fame. Most intriguing of all is the Korean card game that frames the action - a game that attracts die-hard gamblers and a small group of cheats who live off the system. As such, this often feels like THE STING, but with a more brutal core. The narrative is set out in a series of \"lessons\" any prospective gambler must learn; with each lesson, the risks become increasingly challenging. The narrative almost manages to support a love story, though there's no room in a gambler's heart for true love. The energy of the narrative is matched by the plot's daunting complexity, but the film journeys into surprising areas. It's safe to say that TAJJA will inspire many more gambling features, though it would be hard to surpass the originality and style of this film.", "The War of Flowers, arguably one of the best Korean motion pictures based on cartoons, is a film about gamblers. The film boldly anatomises and exposes the underworld of gamblers which seems to epitomise our greedy capitalist society. And it is well-timed, given a corruption scandal involving pachinko parlours that has given a big blow to Korea's already beleaguered ruling party.As a movie partly comic and partly brutal which deals with working class characters living on the dark side, it outdoes Guy Ritchie's 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. The actors, main and supporting alike, are superb. In particular, Stunning Kim Hye Soo exquisitely plays a Dashiell Hammettish femme fatale who \"contrives and organises\" fraud gamble matches as well as lures easy preys.Director-cum-scripter Choi Dong Hun weaves together all these characters and their stories in a seemingly effortless manner, showing his brilliance.", "Movies about gambling are very rare in Korea,and none have been a smash hit. I myself didn't expect to be impressed with the film Tajja,which is based on the hit comic with the same name. Coming out of the theater, I thought it was the best movie I have ever seen. The story revolves around KimGonni(Cho Seung Woo),who loses all his money to a tajja while playing the traditional Korean gambling game 'Hwatoo'. For a while he just visits illegal gambling centers,hoping to catch the tajja who took all his money. Coincidentally he happens to cross the most skilled tajja in the country,PyoungGyoungJang(Baek Yoon Sik).Becoming Pyoung's apprentice,Gonni learns the skills and tricks,becoming a master tajja himself and earning loads of money.While he promised PyoungGyoungJang that he will retire once he earned five times the money he lost,he just can't seem to stop playing hwatoo.But the world of gambling is not pleasant as it looks........ I don't want to be critical,but all the comic based Korean movies that I have seen sucked, including the horror film 'Apartment'and 'Dasaeposonyu'. 'Tajja'was different. It carried on the story so swiftly and interesting that the running time of about 140minutes just passed swiftly like the wind. I was especially impressed with Yoo Hae Jin,who plays Gonni's friend tajja Ko Gwang Ryol, and, like all the people who've seen this movie,Kim Hae Soo, who plays Madame Jung,a woman who organizes planned gambling games with tajjas. I hope there will be a sequel,because 'Tajja'totally changed my view of Korean movies.", "A scrambled time-line leads to an initial sense of an impressionistic, messy plot that the viewer will have to try to put back together at the end. An overarching story does develop eventually even though the particulars pile up like a plate of noodles.Go Ni is a young man who gets involved in gambling, first as a perpetual loser, then as an apprentice to a master gambler, and finally as an accomplished high roller that is heavily compromised with its violent milieu. The game is no-limit hwatu, a sort of Korean poker, played with thumb sized cards, any of which easily hidden in the palm of your hand. And there lies the rub, for the small size of the cards allows conjuring professional gamblers to win consistently over innocent suckers.As Go Ni rises through the ranks, he eventually reaches the rarefied heights of the high rollers, where more money is bet than you can shake a stick at. It is also an environment of strongmen and women with its own violent rules.There is a fair amount of hwatu gambling and it would help to know some about the game, in particular the ability to recognize card faces. It would help but it is not strictly necessary.This is the kind of film whose central premise is that violence is entertaining. The more perverse the better. There is plenty of it, though the gore is contained. It is not the aseptic, blazing-guns style of violence so dear to the American psyche, but the intimate violence of the sharp blade more to the liking of orientals. The high rollers culture of illegal gambling filled with trickery and treachery but also with a retributive code of honor is a perfect breeding ground for that kind of violence. Mounds of money on the table are insufficient to pump adrenaline into the veins of underworld figures with plenty of blood in their hands. Limbs -- in the form of fingers, ears and hands -- are bet. It's no longer a question of winning but one of not losing, of humiliating and debasing your opponent psychologically but, more perversely, physically.If gambling and blood fests are your cup of tea, then you should be satiated, otherwise you have been warned. If you do see this, pay attention to the four rules of the master. They can be useful for life in general. Paraphrasing rule four: \"Your friends are not forever, neither are your enemies.\""], "1132": ["Wonderful acting, brilliant writing, and great, classical music. One can't help but appreciate classical music that much more after seeing this series. Poetic, sad, dramatic, hilarious, and humane, I loved the high quality involved in this production.The story involves violinist Doo Roo-mi (Lee Ji-ah)who hires Maestro Kang Gun-woo to lead an orchestra that has recently disbanded due to a former manager running off with all the money. She hires replacements for the orchestra, which consist of mostly amateurs, country bumpkins, and misfits with a dream to perform at a band. Amongst the members is a trumpeter who has the same name as Kang Gun-woo (Jang Geun-seok), who may prove to be a musical genius.Kim Myung Min's portrayal of the perfectionist and arrogant Maestro Kang Gun-woo is both maddening and hilarious. Maestro Kang's scathing aggressiveness and sharp tongue exudes frank, sometimes admirable, efficiency and cold calculation. Things that come out of his mouth causes people to run off, break down, and cry. Carrying the nickname \"Orchestra Killer\" (because orchestra members tend not to stick around longer than six months under him), this character has a hard time dealing with regular people as he himself doesn't see himself as regular.Despite the fact that Maestro Kang treats his orchestra like trash, we find that he is actually a very complex character. Adding to the complexity are the orchestra members' own personal, social, and financial issues, and a love triangle between the two Kang Gun-woo and Doo Roo-mi.Be sure to check this out on DVD or Hulu."], "1133": ["For people who have become sick of trying to find anything new to watch on cable TV recently or gotten board waiting 3 weeks in between episodes, it may be time to broaden your horizons with some of the amazing shows made by other countries. I watched The kingdom of the Winds (I am sure the title sounded better in its original language) on Drama Fever recently. Drama Fever brings top TV shows from around the world but mainly ones that are translated from Korean or Spanish. There are tons of gems on there and this is one of them. Korean TV has a huge and growing fan base around the world and with good reason, it's awesome!The Kingdom of the Winds follows the story of one of the great kings from one of the countries in what eventually became Korea. It starts from when he was abandoned as a baby (because of a dire prophecy about what he would do when he grew up), to when he had finally overcome the considerable odds to become a great king and takes over a bunch of other countries.Many of the shows that focus on early Korean history, are about the desire of the king to unify all of Korea. Like many countries, Korea used to be made up of a bunch of smaller kingdoms, which meant they all lived with the threat of being taken over by one of the other countries. The king who eventually unifies the country, would be remembered for a thousand years and let his people live in safety. A nice idea, except they all had that idea, so they seemed to live in perpetual war. This show is set in the early part of Korean history, fairly close to the time when the Romans were nailing a bloke called Jesus to wooden cross elsewhere in the world. This is a time when wars were waged with swords and arrows, which makes for great action sequences and fun TV.For the first half of the series, the shows star doesn't even know he is a prince, which gives him the opportunity to join the army as a regular soldier, learn to be a ninja and pick up loads of loyal lowly friends, who go on to become his loyal subjects when the truth about his identity is discovered. Slight rewind, yes, I said ninja. That term we use for men wearing cool suits, with martial arts skills we envy, doing secret nighttime missions in black masks. It seems that Koreans have their own version, as it is not the first Korean show I have seen which features them. In this show, they don't specifically refer to them as ninjas, but they look and act like them. Their secret group is called \"the black shadows\", which sounds like the name of a ninja clan too. They are trained to posses super human fighting skills and they conduct missions at night wearing all black, with face masks. This ninja-like group features heavily all the way through the series. They belong to an enemy country and the star of the show is captured by them. After they have tortured him for a while, he ends up joining them for a bit. In fact, just long enough to learn their fighting skills, before seeing the error of his ways and taking his new skills back home. His ninja skills makes him a compelling option to become crown prince in his home country. The perfect hero of the people - a royal prince, but one who is in touch with the common man, has experienced battle from the front line and has led a hard life, which gives him a level of resolve that eludes his girlie little brother. At first, his dad (the current king), doesn't know who he is. When his identity is discovered, he won't accept him (due to the prophecy about his future). Eventually, he wins him and everyone else over with his valiant acts and is proclaimed crown prince. Once the star has become king, the enemy continues to send its ninja-like black shadows to try an assassinate him or kidnap his girlfriend (who happens to be an enemy princess). Having a history of being a black shadow himself, who better than our king to come up with a strategy to stop them? Like most of the Korean dramas I have watched, this show is great because of the variety of interesting characters, their complicated love interests, friendships and betrayals etc. They really take the time to develop each roll to the point where you feel like you know them.I have tried to be a little vague on the story as I don't want to ruin it for anyone and I don't like reviews where people try to write the book of the movie. All we really want to know from a review, is, should I watch it or not? The answer here is yes, for fans of actions movies, anything to do with martial arts or ninjas and fans of drama or history. It is also a good one to watch with the Mrs, as it satisfies our craving for action, and gives them the drama and love story that they need to stay interested. The action sequences are cool but not too gruesome, Now, for those of you who are afraid of subtitles and say things like \"I can't be bothered to read now, I just want to relax\", stop being lazy! You are missing out on loads of amazing shows. You get used to subtitles after a while and it is really no problem. Haven't you ever read a book and found it relaxing?", "a marvelous mini series (if that's the correct term)which enthralls right from the start and never lets go. In it's 36 or so hours, it seldom puts a foot wrong. The performances from some of the actors including female are hard to gauge in particular the two leading men, and the leading actresses ie Oh Yoon Ah as hye ap, who i nominate as the sexiest female character I've seen in a long time, and we never even get to see her legs. Then there is Choi Jung Won as Princess Yeon, who is full of grace and serenity. But I have no doubt that the best performance comes from Jung Jin Young as king yuri. plaudits also to among others Kim Hye Ri as as Lady Mi Yoo (Yeo Jin's mother), and Han Jin Hee as King Daeso. yes, there are faults. There is plenty of fighting, but very little blood. At one stage, i thought a character who was being executed had survived. it looked like the executioners blade had missed him. but no, he had been killed. when one of the main characters is killed in a rather inhumane way, and his friend has the opportunity to treat the instigator in like manner, he doesn't. perhaps it's to do with Korean TV restrictions. the two leading male and female characters are not without fault. At one stage, she poisons someone, and he has a tendency at times to kill people who are no threat to him. perhaps it was just one person, i can't remember. i see those as positive aspects of the series. When one of the lead characters dies, my heart broke. and i cried like anything. That is one of the great strengths of Korean movies and TV dramas; the emotion they can get from you, and also how they involve you in the stories. highly recommended without reservations"], "1134": [], "1135": [], "1136": [], "1137": [], "1138": [], "1139": [], "1140": [], "1141": [], "1142": ["The Virtual Bride (aka The Eccentric Daughter-in-Law) is a 12 episode KTV drama from the summer of 2015.SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: A struggling young idol agrees to star in a variety show in order to gain popularity for her and the girl idol group she's a member of. This \"fake\" variety show involves her going to live and work with the mother of the guy she's \"pretend\" dating, along with said guy, and their extended family.This shows stars Kim Dasom (I don't know what her actress name or real life name is, but she's a member of the idol group \"Sistar\"). I am familiar with Sistar and who Dasom is, but this my first exposure to her as an actress. She has participated in two other TV dramas prior to this, but they were both well over 100 episodes, and I have neither the time nor inclination to watch shows of that length. The first thing you should know about Dasom is that she is SMOKING hot (just like all of her Sistar idol mates). The entire group is built (ahem) to be as sexy as possible, while still trying to exhibit a cute and fun appeal at the same time; go watch some of their music videos and you'll see what I'm referring to. Can Dasom act though?, and, is this show worthwhile?...well, let's find out!As our story begins, Dasom's character (Oh In Young) makes her way to the variety show set (which takes place in a farm/home setting which prepares various traditional Korean food & sauces for restaurants & other buyers). This is a place that requires you to work hard and get your hands dirty. In Young, however, loves her high heels and skimpy flashy outfits and she's ill-suited for this environment at first. As such, the family she's moved in with disapproves of her right away, but they've agreed to do the show, and if it's well received, their business will prosper (and so will In Young and her idol group & company). Over time, the show becomes popular as In Young fits in a little better, and starts slowly winning over the entire family and their ever discerning family matriarch. And of course, she and her nerdy but handsome \"fake show love interest costar\" begin to have actual feelings for each other.You'll immediately notice this show has a pretty low budget. That's OK, but you must compensate for fiscal restraints by having some combination of a good story, solid writing, proper direction, and stellar acting performances. Unfortunately, this show doesn't really do any one of those things very well. You know you're in for some pain and suffering when the first couple of episodes consist mainly of a midriff baring lead having multiple gassy/fart problems, followed by the introduction of several stereotypical self-centered & annoying Korean cinema mothers, followed by a bunch of mama boys that need to grow up, followed by younger female characters who are searching for self-empowerment. YUK!The second thing you'll notice about this show is that it resembles a long running day time Korean soap opera that's been compressed to 12 episodes and played on fast forward. Almost every scene consists of a one or two minute interaction between one or more cast members, then it's on to the next one or two minute scene. The way it's scripted and framed doesn't help matters either; it consists mainly of a close up shot of Character A reading a single line, then a close up of Character B reading a single line, then repeat some back and forth like this until the end of their short scene. At the end of each scene, someone references or mentions something about a 3rd party not involved in the current scene. Then, cut away to said 3rd party having their own short scene, then continue this formula FOREVER until the show eventually concludes.Because of how the scenes are written, there never seems to be any personal interaction or meaningful communication among any of the character. It feels like everyone is just reading lines and nothing more. All of the characters involved are supposed to \"evolve\" over time, but it's a very cumbersome & repetitive process along the way; someone accepts someone, then turns their back on them, then accepts them again; this pattern of behavior is repeated often throughout this show between multiple characters, and, it really becomes tedious and just plain absurd as the show drags on. As a result, this show is severely lacking in any depth, and it fails to ever build any suspense, tension, or momentum.The cast does what they're asked, and they mostly do OK (but just barely). There are several insufferable performances though, and no standout ones. The cast's star power and /or acting prowess (or lack thereof) isn't the problem here though; where this show fails clearly lies at the feet of the writers and the director. Good K-dramas build towards their climax and include multiple important scenes where you can't take your eyes off the screen, which in turn, engages the viewer to invest in the story, care about its characters, and look forward to the next episode. Sadly, this show doesn't ever accomplish any of this. As far as Dasom's performance goes, she did all right with what she was given to work with. I doubt she'll ever win any best actress awards, but she could likely make a decent living in this field if given the chance to be aligned with shows that have better stories and some decent writing and direction. Until that happens though, she shouldn't quit her day job with Sistar (which she is excellent at)!Summary: Unfortunately, I have to drop the hammer on this show; it's neither interesting nor intelligent nor original. This is clearly a project that was just designed to quickly fill a time slot and nothing more. In short, it has no heart and no soul. Don't waste your time with this.Bottom Line: 4 out of 10 stars!...Not recommended!"], "1143": [], "1144": [], "1145": [], "1146": [], "1147": [], "1148": [], "1149": [], "1150": [], "1151": [], "1152": [], "1153": [], "1154": [], "1155": ["Iljimae is an amazing story about a kid who goes out at night to rob from the rich and give to the poor.

A complete MUST watch for any drama fan that wants some action, mixed in with romance and so much more! It is definitely something i wish i had on DVD to OWN... The acting and character development was actually rather well done albeit cheesy in a moment or two... At times it gave me a laugh, a tear of joy and sadness and a sense of excitement. All keeping me coming back for more and actually wanting to live in such a world.Now the music was pretty good and kept the flow of the story together rather well... but often music samples were overplayed during certain scenes, mainly during action sequences.ALL IN ALL, the series was a complete knockout! If you are looking for action, suspense, mystery, and a little dash of romance then WATCH THIS!!!!! I tend to watch only historical Korean dramas and this one did not disappoint. It relatively short compared to other historical dramas but there is no drag in the storyline. You will fall in love with all the characters and keep on waiting for the truth to be finally revealed.There's not a dull character in here. With the way that the interconnected story arcs are woven into what is ostensibly a pitch-perfect action-comedy-drama trifecta that will hook and won't let go. You won't want to stop watching this one. So many great, colourful characters that are wonderfully acted, and well written. While it may start slow after an action-packed first 15 minutes, the story will soon come to a rolling boil, as you can't wait for the next chapter of this series to watch. Expect some sleepless nights of \"just one more\" to quickly happen, should you jump into this series. It may cause some tired, red-eyed mornings, but I'll guarantee, they're worth it.

Its is really a awesome drama SBS so watch it ...after seeing it I had to reveal the ending... Iljimae wasn't killed, but in the end you will see that the assassin, stabbed Iljimae with Iljimae's-sword, his sword had a dull blade ...remember his \"sunbae\" Kang-kil had given him a dull blade on his sword and telling him it is not for killing...but to save lives...also no one was ever killed by that sword. The 1st scene in episode 1 is after his disappearance at the end of episode 20 was a fictional story told by the citizens as a way to preserve the history of Iljimae in there hearts, so the bow and arrow wasn't real (hence the invisible cloak he used to enter the building, come on in that day-an-age an invisible cloak). And if I am not wrong the child in the end of episode 20 is Dani's son she had with Seo Dol.PS: \"The Return of Iljimae\" played by the actor Joo Ji Hoon that broadcasted January 2009 has nothing to do with this Iljimae. Same character name, but a totally different storyline.", "I really enjoyed watching this serie and fell in love with Korean cinema.\nDefinitely recommendable.", "8/10:\nOverall, Iljimae is the pinnacle of Korean historical drama. Everything from the sound track, the acting and even the nuanced plot would, in my honest opinion, be unchallenged for a very long time for the title of most well-made drama! It also has a lot of \"rewatch potential\".Plot:\nThe plot is clear, with a steady pace of plot progression. The clear backstory of the protagonist, Yong, provided unwavering motivation for him to drive the story forward, hence there was a distinct end goal, drive and a compelling process in between audience could be entertained, moved by and feel sympathy for the main character in the process.The story also brings in the theme of class and tackles it brilliantly through the use of imagery and juxtaposition to emphasise horrid conditions of living, and allows the audience to side more with the anti-establishment robber by painting a good villain. That said, this portrayal sometimes goes too far, making villains, most nobles that is, seem like one-dimensional, greedy creatures with no sense of shame or any other emotions for that matter.The relationships in the film, be it parental or romantic, around Yong, were well explored and extremely moving. Yong's relationship with his foster father was touching and felt genuine, in part due to the script and the actor playing the father's brilliant constant look of concern, in part also due to the comedic relief he provided do separate him from the other characters with devious intentions. His death was a truly memorable and tear-inducing moment in the film, which is a testament to how great the film was at portraying their relationship. As for Yong's relationship with Eun Chi and Bong Soon, it was less powerful but not underwhelming. It would have been better if the love triangle between the 3 could be resolved by the last episode.It would also have been an improvement if the last episode provided more of a closure. The show has built on a kind of dramatic irony of Eun Chi not knowing Il Ji Mae's actual identity which creates tension that begs for release the audience never got. It would also have been better if the final episode showed Yong, as a civilian, alive and well, rather than a pseudo-ambiguous ending whereby audiences need to get confirmation from directors. That said, it is rare and bold for directors to choose to have a bitter-sweet ending (bitter since Yong is unable to live with his friends and family for fear of hurting them, a sacrifice of a hero; sweet because he is still alive and actively seeking revenge) which is definitely commendable. <8/10>Background Music: Songs and background music were very well scored and timed. The main theme was inserted during critical junctures of the plot which certainly made those moments more impactful. Certain elements of the music also fit the period the film was set in, the most memorable of which was \"Gingko Hillside\". Not only has the songs helped advance the plot and shaped the audience to feel a certain way, they are also great additions to any music playlist to listen to every now and again. <10/10>Lines and Line Delivery: Actors were perfect for the role and delivered lines in a compelling fashion. There is so much nuance in the dialogue and the script that makes every time rewatching the show feel like a different experience. Many instances of dramatic irony, foreshadowing, symbolism and general imagery made it feel like a literary haven with techniques seldom used in modern filmmaking. In addition, subtle cues and the discrete dialogue are refreshing as opposed to having every detailed spelled out to the audience in the script. Perfect!<10/10>Special Effects and Choreography: To be honest, the film is visibly lacking in this aspect. Some scenes were extremely poorly shot with green screen it was almost laughable. One notable example would the scene in episode 2 with the ice hole. The fight choreography was victim to the common one-on-one fighting motif which is unrealistic and impractical. (This refers to the instances whereby the protagonist is heavily outnumbered but somehow is able to survive because enemies choose to fight him one by one rather than taking him on all at once.) That said, one redeems aspect about the fight choreography was that it was clear and easy to determine what was going on. <4/10>"], "1156": [], "1157": [], "1158": [], "1159": ["This is not a staight forward story about romance between a poor girl and a handsome CEO.

I have only started watching K-drama just 1-2 months ago and I could really understand now why the world just go crazy over K-drama series. Anyways, I really love this K-drama series. It is a different kind of love story where 2 unexpected people from 2 different worlds and with totally opposite types and temperament from each other, yet they were fated to end up together, no matter what life, people and obstacles were put in from of them. It is full of bitter sweet moments, many funny and hilarious events, and yet some painful and heart wrenching times too. After hours and hours of roller-coaster feelings and boxes of tissues wiping off tears later, I really can say this is one of the best K-drama or any life/love-story dramas I have ever seen in my lifetime. Plus the songs are so good too.This Korean version is much better than the Taiwanese version of \"Fated to Love You\". The Korean version is more realistic (the main Korean guy is more older and more believable as the head of a big corporation than the Taiwanese guy - who looked too young and cute); there are so funny, passionate and painful moments too. All their cast acting are very believable, and they put their full effort in their roles.This K-drama is highly recommended.", "What a beautiful drama, with the perfect mix of emotion and humour and a heavy dose of some great acting. Fated to love you is a drama that focuses on the feelings and character development, the thoughts and emotions - and that's what I thought was refreshing.

It's sad to see that some of you are too busy critiquing the lack of complexity in the plot, because it is this simplicity that makes this movie so beautiful. Since many of you have already reiterated the plot, i'll just cut the chase and try to clear up some confusion, hopefully.First of all, to understand why he let the girl go and turns against his boss, the flashback towards the end is very crucial. When she plays the cello, he smiles, and as he is dying, he smiles as he listens to her voice. These are the only two occasions in which he smiles throughout the entire movie. Whether this is love, attraction, or because he was thankful that she made him feel good, is open to interpretation. Given that he is an extremely straightforward and honest character(and also given that in this movie, everything is what you see on the screen- there are no hidden motives, twists, whatsoever), I assume that the reason he doesn't answer (or CAN'T answer) when asked why he did it by his boss is because he doesn't know himself. I think the key to understanding this movie is the title, and the narration at the end of the movie (something along the line of a disciple telling his master that he cries after a sweet dream because he knows it can't come true). For Sunwoo,the girl and his belief(?) that he can kill everyone else and still live are sweet dreams that cannot come true. The reason why he unrealistically gets by after getting shot and stabbed so much, is not simply because he is the main character, but because everything he does after meeting the girl is like a sweet 'dream', a surreal reality(yes, an oxymoron, just like the title- a 'bittersweet' life). The morbid ending is also very fitting- as sweet as the dream was, the more bitter it is when he \"wakes up\" from it and faces reality(once again relating to the last narration).", "This masterpiece comes from the director of Tales of Two Sisters and he delivers an epic tale of revenge.I can't urge you enough to see this movie. The gun battles are reminiscent of Scarface, the martial arts are gritty and realistic, the poignancy of unrequited love is painful, there is a deep philosophical current that underlies this film, and the camera work is superb-but that's not what carries the movie. The actor who plays the main character is what sets this magnificent movie apart from the trash put out by Hollywood. He's a man's man-sharply dressed in well tailored suits driving in a BMW sedan (like the transporter)through beautiful Seoul (showing what a beautiful, spotless, and vibrant city it is). He reaches the point of no return and his vengeance and determination are a tour de force.Magnificent. Bravo. South Korean films reign supreme.", "I could sit here and start this review off any number of ways to make this film sound ultra important. I could say, once in a great while a film comes along, blah, blah. Or, Only a select few films ever have reached this, blah, blah. Or I could say, if you see one movie this year, blah, blah. You know the drill. These are the opening sentences the big-boy critics use when they really want you to see a flick and when they want a particular review to really stand out. Well, films that deserve this kind of \"special\" praise really do only come around once in a great while. Unbelievably, I have seen two in only six months time. The first was what I like to call the first real 21st Century film, and that was Oldboy. And the second film of this status also comes from Korea, believe it or not, and it is Bittersweet Life.Bittersweet Life is probably one of the most simple, most streamlined modern films I have ever seen. It is lean, mean, and like its lead male, a damn ruthless fighting machine. The film beats along with its Raymond Chandler-like screenplay with all the jazz and style of early 90's John Woo and with the energy and themes of Quentin Tarantino's grind house 70's. Life plays with your emotions, making you care for the bad-guy hero even though he is a vicious killer, and causes one to release tension through laughter when the blood starts gushing like a dozen ruptured fire hoses. Wholesale death, blood by the gallons, broken bones and multiple beatings with humongous pipe-wrenches, two-by-fours, and lead pipes are on order, right after a heaping dish of innocent love and a guy trying for once to do the right thing.The plot, well you see, it's like this: you can see everything coming a mile away, the movie plays it straight, and follows the exact path you know it will and the exact path you hope it will. There are no twist endings, no complicated triple crosses, no hidden motives for the characters. Everything on screen happens the way you see it, and everything thing ends exactly the way you picture it. And this is a good thing. The film is so on track that it doesn't need a twist or a swerve to make you pay attention. It starts at A, ends at E, and hits B, C and D on the way there. Life is so steeped in its genre tropes of noir character and themes that the ending is know to all of us before it even starts. However, it's the journey that matters, and I'll be damned if you can find a better-looking, more brutally violent journey anywhere.As much as I try to analyze the film, nothing comes to mind. And this is the purest of all compliments. The film is as shallow as the pools of blood splattered in the hallways, alleyways and run down exteriors of the sets. Often times a director feels the need to bog a simple story down with twists, and a deeper meaning to hide the fact that they are afraid to just let things happen because they need to happen. Bittersweet Life is not one of these films. It exists with its soul laid bare for all to see, and when the carnage is complete, you thank the film for being honest with itself. As the final credits roll you might find yourself asking, \"Is that it?\" Yes, that is it\u0097cinematic perfection. It is all it needs to be: pure and simple, boisterous and calm, bloody and drenched in gore and an honest movie with nothing to hide. --genrebusters", "This is my first review on here, only because I felt compelled to tell someone about this film\u0085 When I say \"coolest,\" I don't mean it in a that-movie-was-really-cool kind of way\u0085 Coolest, in this case, means that it is the smoothest, well-crafted, stylish, and beautiful films I have ever seen. Everything about the film has a you'll-never-be-this-cool feel, like Jules and Vincent from Pulp Fiction. Not to mention the fact that it has the same sort of humor.Now, I am a film student who has actually gotten a lot of praise from students and teachers and whatnot for my first film project\u0085 That's great and all, but after seeing this film I am reminded of what Steven Spielberg said after he saw The Godfather; \"I guess I should quit now, because I will never make something this good.\" I am, in no way, comparing myself to Spielberg, I'm just describing the feeling of, \"holy s***, this is amazing,\" and \"wow, I could never do this ever\u0085\"See this movie before you die\u0085 Or before it gets remade.", "For director Kim Jee-woon, humor is a basic element of films. And he says no matter how dark and moody it may seem, his new film ''A Bittersweet Life (Talkomhan Insaeng)\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af is no exception.''This movie basically deals with relationship breakups resulting from small communication breakdowns,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af Kim said during a news conference Monday after the preview screening of ''A Bittersweet Life.\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af Without calling it comedy exactly, sometimes audiences have to laugh at very serious or ironic situations, Kim said.Kim has shown his unique morbid sense of humor in previous movies such as ''The Quiet Family,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af a black comedy about a family who kill visitors to their cottage, ''The Foul King,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af a comic drama about an amateur wrestler, and one horror contribution work for the omnibus film ''Three.\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af Kim is also behind ''A Tale of Two Sisters,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af the psychological horror film that became a summer hit in 2003.''A Bittersweet Life,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af starring Lee Byung-hun from ''Everybody Has a Little Secret\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af and Shin Mina from ''Madeleine,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af portrays the desperate and brutal revenge of Sun-woo (played by Lee) after he is expelled from his gang and comes close to being killed by his boss.Lee Byung-hun is a hit-man who falls for the girlfriend of his boss in the stylishly violent \u00a1\u00b0A Bittersweet Life.\u00a1\u00b1 Conventional ideas of causation are put into doubt in director Kim Jee-woon's twist on film noire. ''A Bittersweet Life (Talkomhan Insaeng)'' is what Korean critics are describing as ''Action Noire.'' In it, he tweaks the traditional Korean gangster story line, presenting a work with film noire undertones and stylish cinematography.Sun-woo (Lee Byung-hun) is a revenging dark angel dressed in black. Gang leader Kang (Kim Young-cheol) assigns Sun-woo, his right-hand man, to watch after his nubile girlfriend/professional cellist Hee-soo (Shin Mina) while he is away and find out about the other guy with whom he suspects she is messing around.The plot is complicated by Sun-woo's existential decision to stray from the explicit instructions with which he is charged. He is cryptically told time and again to make good on a promise, but he never exactly know what that is.Much of the action occurs in the long shadows the sprawling megapolis Seoul casts. Here, the gangsters wish they were too cool to be killed. No friend can really be trusted as the good guys are not so good and the bad guys can be down right evil. Importantly, the motivation of his tormentors is shrouded in mystery.But the movie has been labeled ''action noire'' for a good reason. The stylistic ultra-violence of director Kim is superb. The creepy fisherman killer represents a unique Korean twist on the classic film noire villain. Our hero is not a good, good guy either, and I loved that about him. He is not only tough, but also a stone-face killer _ a tribute to both the director and actor's character interpretation.After all, gangsters should fight to kill, and that means sometimes going for the knees and other joints, hitting low and dirty to take the guy out quick. In general, the fight scenes were creative. Watch for the face-dragged-across-the-cinderblock-wall scene, perhaps a first for cinematic violence.", "I had the luck to watch this gem at the Fantasy-Film-Festival in Frankfurt yesterday. It was shown in a theater with about 600 seats and against my expectations the room was packed with people.In comparison with Oldboy or Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance the story is not as deep and goes more straightforward to the pure revenge theme. But this does not make the movie less enjoyable. The cinematography is brilliant and the main-character delivers a great performance. It contains beautifully choreographed martial-arts and gunfight scenes with references to masterpieces like Taxi Driver and Kill Bill. Despite the fact it is very harsh in some scenes the humor does not come to short. The scene with a discussion of Korean-Russian wannabe-gangsters made me nearly wet my pants.", "I had the opportunity to watch this brilliant movie at home, while translating it from English to Greek for the viewers of the Thessaloniki Film Festival in November, 2005.I was impressed by the stunning performance of the leading actor, as well as of the other actors. The music of the film was also wisely selected.Some -few- funny moments in the film help the viewer lighten up and get ready for what I saw as brilliantly directed fighting scenes, that neither bored me nor made me look away.At the end of the film, when the desciple was crying for \"a dream that can never come true\" I was absolutely sure that what I saw was nothing less than a true work of art.", "Everything is believable, from the small things like the way in which the main character first falls in love with his boss's girlfriend because of the delicate curve of her neck and the way the main character fumbles with a gun for the first time while he tries to put it together, to the theme of revenge that this films is propelled by.The main character (Sun-Woo) has lived most of his life serving his 'Hyong-Nim' (Korean for boss in the gangster underworld). He has in fact dedicated 7 years of his life to him, taking care of the dirty work his dirty work. His boss (Mr.Kang) sees Sun-Woo as one of his most trusted 'Ah-Ho' (Korean for underling), and this is where you recognised that family-based element of the gangster underworld. In Korea, the society is largely based on a strict hierarchal system, where you must respect your elders and demand respect from people younger than you. Although right now, Korea is slowly moving away from convention and traditions, the underworld of gangs stills strictly upholds this hierarchal system. The theme of revenge stems from this, as Mr.Kang feels like a betrayed father, with his underling, Sun-Woo protects his boss's girlfriend from getting caught cheating. Mr. Kang follows the protocol of the underworld and decides to punish Sun-Woo who has been like a son to him. Before Sun-Woo suffers the punishment, Mr.Kang asks him why did he betray him, to which Sun-Woo replies, \"I thought if she promised never to cheat on you, everything would be back to normal... I thought everything would be OK.\" To this, Mr.Kang says, \"No, its OK, tell me the truth... It's because you fell for her, isn't it?\" Sun-Woo cannot lie as he stays silent, confused. As he kneels down in the mud in this scene, you see on the main characters face the realisation that after all this time of never falling in love with anyone, the one girl that turned his head was his boss's girlfriend. Earlier in the movie, there is a scene where Mr.Kang and Sun-Woo have dinner together as father and son in a family of the underworld, where Mr.Kang says that he hates being lied to and that if Sun-Woo caught his young girlfriend cheating, that Sun-Woo should kill her. Mr.Kang contradicts himself here, as he is in fact married with a wife who he is cheating on by being with this new younger girlfriend. Mr.Kang believes that in the underworld of gangsters, if your boss says something and he is wrong, you must still agree and follow his lead. There is a Japanese gangster saying, \"If your boss says black is white and white is black, you must agree. If he says there is no sky, then to you there is no sky.\" Mr.Kang punishes Sun-Woo for what he says is betrayal of the code of master and disciple hierarchy. Sun-Woo almost loses his life as he refuses to be punished, fighting against gangsters that he was once the general of. This is where the main character's 'Hamlet-styled' contemplation of revenge takes place. As the story shows the audience Sun-Woo breaking away from tradition and convention by refusing punishment set down by his elder, we also see the main character breaking away from the tradition of close quarter combat as he tries to acquire firearms. To the main character, his boss's actions confuse him. Sun-Woo spent 7 years of his life serving Mr.Kang, and in the final scene Sun-Woo confronts Mr.Kang with this fact. Sun-Woo screams, \"I rotted away serving you for 7 years! Were you really going to kill me?!\" To Sun-Woo, Mr.Kang's actions were too severe. Ironically, this time its Sun-Woo asking Mr.Kang \"No, its OK, tell me the truth... Tell me why you really tried to kill me.\" At this moment, we see that Mr.Kang chose to punish Sun-Woo, not because he wanted to uphold the law of the underworld, but because he was simply jealous of Sun-Woo, of Sun-Woo's youth. Mr.Kang's reason for cheating on his own wife with a younger woman may also suggest Mr.Kang's thirst for youth. Sun-Woo points pistol at his own boss, his father his mentor and I truly expected him not to fire, but I was totally wrong. As Mr.Kang's character may symbolize tradition and convention, Sun-Woo strikes him down as a unpredictable force of chaos and revolution. The way in which we try and control our lives could be seen as the convention of the hierarchal system where humans try to uphold peace and order. Through the main character, this story depicts how bullshit the 'system' is and that life can prove to be utter chaos the more we try to control it and bring order to it. The most powerful scene in this movie I thought was really breathtaking was the final scene where after having been shot numerous times and barely breathing, the main character calls the girl he has recently fallen for. As she picks up, he drops the phone and can only hear her voice. Comforted only by her voice saying \"Yeo Boh Sae Yo?\" (Korean way of asking who is it on the phone) he looks up to see wind blowing in the leaves of a tree. He then seems to be lost in a dream, in his final moments of living. But then his dream is cut very shot, ALL OF A SUDDEN by a single shot to his head. It almost as if he was dreaming and then woke up to see his life, to see nothing.", "Sun-Woo is the manager of sleek modern restaurant in uptown Seoul called La Dolce Vita, but that's not his only employment. He is also the errand-boy of underworld Kingpin Mr Kang. A job he fulfils ruthlessly and efficiently, until the day Mr Kang takes off for a week, leaving Sun-Woo to mind his much younger girlfriend Hee-Soo to make sure she doesn't sleep around. If she does, he is to execute both of them. Hee-Soo cheats. Sun-Woo almost sentences them to death, but has a sober moment and realises that letting them go is the right thing to do.In Mr Kang's absence a rival crime syndicate, headed by President Baek and his over-confident son is becoming more and more impatient to force a business merger with Kang. Despite Kang's reluctance to go through with this deal one of his own men, Sun-Woo's cohort, Min-Gi welcomes the business with Baek and his son and complicates matters.Upon Kang's return he figures out Sun-Woo's failure to carry out his orders and demands he be killed unless he apologises. At this moment, Sun-Woo is about to be tortured to death by Baek Jr. but is returned to Kang on the promise that he will do business.It's out of the frying pan and into the deepest pits of fiery hell for Sun-Woo. Already bashed and bruised and beaten he is cast down in the mud during a heavy rainstorm and forced to apologise. He resists. His hand is crushed with a massive wrench he is buried alive.He survives and breaks through the loose soil. Sun-Woo and the audience breathe a sigh of relief. But it's far from over. Min-Ji and a large group of thugs are still waiting by the shallow grave. They drag him into a old building and give him 15 minutes to call Mr. Kang and beg for his life. Still he refuses. And when those 15 minutes are up Sun-Woo unleashes an incredibly lethal and jaw-droppingly furious ass-kicking like you have never seen. He goes through about 20 men like they weren't even there and dishes out agonising, blood-soaked punishment in one of the most nail-biting escapes you'll ever see.It's now time for Sun-Woo to plan his revenge. And that he does with lovingly violent detail.A Bittersweet Life comes in 3 large acts that make the 120-minute running time pass in a breeze. The set-up and story are so simple and honest that you can literally start-watching the film at any point and still become immersed in the action. But, I feel that many viewers may be missing the twist at the end.By 'twist' I mean after Sun-Woo's death the film goes back to the beginning, revealing that he only fantasised the whole thing. He says the cruelty of any sweet dream is waking up to find yourself back in the real world. He is still in his restaurant and when no one is looking, insecurely looking over his shoulder to make sure, Sun-Woo shadow boxes for fun or curiosity. Hardly the kind of behavior you would expect from a man who has just annihilated 50 baddies.But, regardless of the final outcome, it's the high-octane journey you take to get there that really matters right? And A Bittersweet Life is one movie you'll want to watch over and over again.", "After Tale of Two Sisters, Ji-woon Kim's new movie has been eagerly anticipated. In his previous film, the marks of originality, intellectual challenge and superb visual style hailed the possibility of a brave new voice in Korean cinema.A Bittersweet Life commences with similarly awesome photography and ambiance. The wind in the leaves of a tree - Is it the leaves or the wind that moves? asks the disciple of the master. Neither, he replies, it is your mind and heart that moves. Cut to La Dolce Vita, the swish bar restaurant which we are to discover is also the gangland stronghold of Sun-Woo. A single tree in the centre of the restaurant's sky lounge. The colours red and black, glossy and visually forceful in the lounge - they not only play heavily in the film but make any small deviations stand out. Lushness or delicacy is easily conveyed later in the film by colour, a respite to the bloodshed that will almost swamp us. A tinkling piano (Chopin is used as part of the score) adds a delicate counterpoint to what we know will surely be an overload of violence and mayhem.Sun-Woo has served his boss, President Kang, faithfully for seven years and is now manager of Dolce Vita as well as Kang's right hand man. Background profits, and gang competition, focuses on innocuous little sidelines like the supply of guns or dancing girls, and which countries these should come from. Kang has a secret lover from the 'normal' world, a cellist who is much younger than he, and whom he suspects of infidelity. Kang entrusts Sun-Woo to sort it out and show no mercy. The warfare that follows goes beyond honour, beyond profit, beyond vengeance, . . . beyond any rational point in fact.Sun-Woo is the ultimate cool bad guy. Indentured to a world of violence and expert in the use of martial arts, knives and guns, he is almost a humanised Bruce Lee who's woken up on a Tarantino set. It sounds almost too good to be true and it is. The story lines are formulaic and derivative, consisting largely of how to engineer more ingenious punch-ups, torture or revenge posturing. Light humour afforded in the contrast between suave topdogs and bumbling henchmen has been done so many times, and many of the entertaining debacles could have been borrowed from Kill Bill. But entertaining it is, on an undemanding level. Sadly it is not the work of the Master that we might have expected from Two Sisters. \"The dream I had can't come true,\" laments the protagonist, and ironically the dreams Ji-woon Kim's fans may justifiably had don't quite come true in A Bittersweet Life, but this otherwise elegant shoot-em-up is still reasonable 'boys night out' night fare.", "When you sit back to watch this film, be prepared for a film that will open your mind,a film that will make you question humanity, and be prepared to be floored by a visual masterpiece which is rare by gangster movie standards.From the first few shots we are feasted with beautiful shots, angles and little references that are simply delightful. The story unfolds showing the brighter side of life, the sweet side if you like. This is portrayed by Sunwoo eating a desert in the opening scene and then more food as the first half continues. The film then plays out to its darker half and we are shown the bitter side of life, which i wont go into and destroy for you.Everything about this film just...Works, even the martial arts scenes are well edited and seem clever, rather than tricking us with quick camera cuts, we get a raw and violent slice of brutal gangster revenge, which again simply delights in a strange bitter way.Simply put, A bittersweet life is simple plot, filmed and played exactly how it is meant to be, exactly how you want it to be. Every scene is fresh with humour or suspense which is so rare by todays standards.This films plays out exactly how you want it to, with the exact camera angles it should, with the perfect music to back it all up. This film is a dark and visual spectacle that must be seen to be believed.9/10", "This was possibly the greatest film I have ever seen. It was superb on so many different levels. The script, the fighting, the special effects all mould the perfect film. Within the first ten minutes i knew this film was going to keep me on the edge of my seat. I have never been so excited by action scenes before and never laughed with so much shock at the extent of brutal fighting. It is a genre of its own as it has none of that Hollywood business where the bad guys always fail and the main character is invincible and although love is a factor it is not overplayed. This film is electrifying to say the very least. It has more fist action than all the ROCKYs put together, more blood than Goodfellas and is as exciting if not more than a Tarantino film.", "... but not only. At the beginning there is a clear homage to a french movie (an almost exactly reconstructed camera move/set-up)! But this movie is more than just the sum of it's parts! And the clue is in the beginning ...A Korean friend of mine told me (Randy N.) that the story reminded him very much of a tale, the \"Tale of \"Jo-Shin\" (Dream of Jo-shin)\" or again in his words \"This tale is one of the most famous Korean tale(And there are many similar tale in Asian culture...).\" So if you listen to the monologue at the beginning and at the end, you will get the movie and what it means. Because this is more than just an action flick. But don't worry, there's plenty of action here to enjoy also. Maybe even too much action for some to stomach! Not for the faint of heart, believe me, or for those who can't stand the sight of blood! It's very philosophical and it has action in it. Highly recommended!", "South Korea has lately been raised as the promised land of cool action movies. And not without a good reason. Oldboy showed us how surprising, daring and gritty Korean movies can be. A Bittersweet life fits the formula otherwise, except its story is age old.An assassin is hired by a gang boss to find out if the gang boss's girlfriend is having an affair with another man. If so, the assassin has to kill both of them. But, as it happens, the assassin falls in love with the girlfriend himself. With violent results. And then he goes out to revenge. In Hollywood, they probably would've made a boring Steven Seagal movie, that follows the same pattern seen a million times already. But in Korea even an old story like this can be made to look cool and refreshing. The result is so good, you can feel it in your stomach. It all works out fine. The actors, the action, the direction. Even the love story is oddly touching. Highly recommended especially to those, who haven't yet seen any korean action movies.**** The best part: (minor SPOILER) The race to load guns at the Russian arms dealer", "usually i don't go for movies when i have college and work both in my hands, thats why when i first started on this movie(recommended by a friend) i was thinking \"why am i wasting my time watching this?\" After seeing this for while i realized that everything is going to get more interesting as the movie proceeded. The action literally took me out of my seat, I've seen a lot of action movies but this one had the simplicity and also the brutality of a fight when it happens in real life. Some movies you just see and realize its good and then you carry on with whatever you're gonna do next. But this movie got me thinking deep of how beautiful and innocent love is........a movie i would recommend to all who r always in search of good movies....", "Very stylish and very bloody, A Bittersweet Life may not be the 'classic' that some have hailed it to be, but it is a very good addition to the Asian gangster genre that is well worth watching. Director Kim Jee-Woon has given us a gripping tale of revenge that treads a well worn path, yet does it with enough panache and style for us to forgive the occasional clich\u00e9.Byung-hun Lee plays Sun-woo, cooler-than-cool right-hand man to crime boss Kang, and manager of a swish hotel. Kang asks Sun-woo to keep an eye on his young girlfriend, Hee-Soo, who he suspects is seeing another man; in the event of his suspicions proving to be true, Sun-woo is to kill the girl and her lover.But when Sun-woo does eventually discover Hee-Soo with another man, he grants the young couple mercy. Angered at Sun-woo disobeying his orders, Kang instructs his men to hunt him down and make him pay for his treachery.They catch him, and submit him to mental and physical torture but, before they are able to kill him, Sun-woo escapes. An extremely miffed Sun-woo then sets about exacting revenge on those responsible for trying to bump him off.With a plot that is neither as fresh or as clever as that other recent great Korean revenge drama, Oldboy, Kim Jee Woon's movie owes a lot of its success to lead actor Byung-hun Lee who puts in a confident performance that is the epitome of cool: dressed in a snappy suit, this hard-as-nails gangster is an unflappable fellow, even faced with what seems like certain death.As one would expect, there is plenty of violence, which slowly escalates until the inevitable final showdown between Sun-woo and Kang. These scenes are handled with aplomb and will go down well with fans of action cinema.With an ending that is open to interpretation by the viewer, A Bittersweet Life leaves one thinking about the film long after the credits have rolled. Despite its occasional flaws and peculiarities (I still don't understand why the majority of the Korean gangsters don't have guns?), I recommend fans of Asian cinema seek this one out, before the inevitable Hollywood remake rears its ugly head.", "It's seems like there is no stopping Korean cinema, as the year isn't yet over and they've already released a handful of spectacular features. Aside from Sympathy for Lady Vengeance, A Bittersweet Life was the second revenge driven film I was eagerly awaiting. I kept my expectations at a reasonable level, even though I was well aware of Kim's reputation, his eye for capturing detail and his strength at creating eerie atmosphere.And the atmosphere here was felt right from the start. Byung-hun Lee plays Sun-woo, a hotel restaurant enforcer and a trusted henchman to a powerful crime boss. From the initial glimpse, Lee carries heavily confined mannerisms and easily achieves seriousness and believability. The action, although a bit reminiscent of the Far East style, is intense yet touches the limits of implausibility, much like the ending. I must say that it wasn't the action that held my interest at first, but Lee's character who was sharply followed by the camera through the nights of driving and contemplating. He vacantly lives from one day to next, feeling strongly disconnected from the world around him, but still manages his duties to perfection and to much praise from his boss Kang.That's until he gets entrusted by Kang to carry out a short task involving his young mistress. The female character had some potential in the beginning as she evoked some elusive feelings in our gloomy lead, but she was abruptly shelved. The story makes the turning point as his mission goes awry, but before I was able to question the cause and effect, next came the brutally unprecedented fight between Sun-woo and the thugs. This helped the story quite a bit, since it showed how something small and avoidable could turn into something big and ugly.This surprisingly fills approximately half of the film. The remaining time offers few black comedic elements, fistful of rapid shooting sequences and even hints at a possibility of a Mexican standoff. Not to nitpick or complain, but purely for the sake of conversing and since the movie is labeled as a \"real life\" actioner, there are moments when you think just why weren't these gangsters carrying guns at so many instances? And no, I didn't ask the same question with Kill Bill.In the beginning of the film, Sung-woo recited; \"Master, are the branches moving or is it the wind?\" - \"That which moves is neither the branches or the wind...It's your heart and mind\". I'm no expert at this or a big fan of decoding messages, but I think that it could simply mean that Sung-woo (or the audience) never meant to know what specifically cradled his life into such reveries, nor was Sun-woo able find any grounds of communication with his former boss who sometimes looked at him as if he was his own son.Regardless, could seven years of being a loyal servant to a respectful boss really have pushed both parties into such desperate measures over this? Perhaps he was too stubborn or jealous of Kang to reveal his cause, but why did he decide to help Hee-soo in the first place? Maybe he wanted her to go back to Kang and make him happy. After all, he was such a calculating person that didn't desire love. Maybe it was just because she found him boring and ethereally played cello? Sun-woo's final quote suggested his envision of a dream or its demise. He failed to achieve what he desired. I failed to fully grasp what he desired as well. Perhaps he wanted a more ambiguous finale that gangsters rarely get afforded in reality, but the one he received was pretty dubious on its own. I ask these questions not in vain or to mercilessly critique this film, but because I genuinely wanted to know more about what drove these characters and wouldn't have minded if the movie was longer. After all it was because of Hee-soo that Sun-woo got to travel on a different path in life. If you'll omit such speculations or enhance the plot by filling in the subtleties of Sun-woo's motives then I'm sure you'll find this film very uncompromising and intense from the first reel up until the final hodgepodge of a bloodbath.Overall this was a fairly decent noirish piece with a prosaic story, glossed by few slick action sequences that will likely get some fans rallied. Although the film shares few similarities with OldBoy, it doesn't compare nor achieves the brute straightforwardness seen in such films as Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Peppermint Candy. It was stylistically directed with pleasant music and cinematography, but it ultimately left me unaffected by the underdevelopment of characters leading up to the final showdown. Maybe it was its intent to come off this way, but at the end of the day I am merely a film fan looking for characters to empathize with, be they cold hearted rapists or washed out ex silver medalists on a bad luck streak.Nevertheless, this film is still recommended and is much better than what Hollywood puts out there most of the time. Give it a try and hopefully you'll find it more overall satisfying than I did.", "Beautiful and brutal. Close to perfect. A hit-man, hired to watch over his boss's mistress, is unable to carry out an execution when he uncovers information concerning the mistress. As a result, he signs his own death warrant. \"Bittersweet Life\" is influenced by Woo's \"The Killer\" and \"Bullet in the Head\", although the pic's nihilism has stronger parallels in Johnny To's masterpiece \"A Hero Never Dies\". The violence is bloody and balletic, exquisitely choreographed and ultra-graphic. There is a melodramatic tone to the drama that imbues each scene with enormous tragedy. It becomes difficult to watch a man suffer so much for simply being a man. Like \"Hero...\", the film has many fantastique elements and can not be judged along traditional lines of dramatic logic. In one sequence, our hero escapes from a muddy grave that no average man could possibly breach. In another, our bullet-ridden hero ignores his physical disintegration in order to complete his mission. Ultimately, this is the story of a lost man who finds his true self via an act of selflessness. And the price one must pay to stand alone.", "I first stumbled upon this film from an Asian website. After its release on DVD, almost everyone on that site was discussing the main character, \"the smile\", and most importantly, his bittersweet life. Starting with the film's visual aspect, it definitely sets the tone of cool, almost like the grayish gloomy tones in Le Samurai(If you loved this movie, you must see Le Samurai) by Herman Melville. His hotel room lacks emotion and appeal, just barren and simple like Sunwoo. The Dolce la Vita bar sways the mood of Sunwoo into this absurd, fragile yet dangerous atmosphere of the Korean gangs. All the blood reds, jet blacks and pure white symbolizes the world of Sunwoo to us, professionally pure yet ruthlessly violent. The acting in this film was superb and extraordinarily done. All the characters only display primary emotions, happiness, anger, fear and dismay. I know this might turn you off as saying there is a lack of extensive creativity, in the world of thugs, creativity can not exist. Mun-Suk was damn fine as an incompetent yet super suck-up to Mr.Kang and he proved it until the end as a backstabbing usual thug. President Kang, well, he won a best supporting actor, and you'll damn get a kick out of him, his raunchy thuggish snarls to his straightforward astonishing violent attacks. Everyone else is simply brilliant and worth watching. In terms of violence, this is the most COOOOOOOOLEST gun scenes you'll ever see. Nothing flashy pansy, this movie god damn rocked. Hurray for Lee Byung-Hun and his astonishing and amazing career, hope to see more of his movies.A BitterSweet Life by Kim Ji-Woon, 10/10", "I'm writing this mostly to put thoughts into order on the idea of a film manipulating the audience. It comes up on film forums now and then and I can agree in principle because I recognize it from personal experience, that some films enable the viewer to experience a feeling while other films demand it of him, but watching KJW's film made it more clear for me. The formula of the revenge film is put in full practice here as a plot, in the first half we get the cruel injustice, in the second half the furious vengeance, yet KJW believes he's making more than a revenge film. The trouble here is that stock characters are put through the motions of living stock feelings and the bodyguard ordered to watch his boss's girlfriend falls in love because the film demands it of him. The film opens with a shot of trees blowing in the wind and a quote of the most banal philosophy (-\"is it the branches moving or the wind?\" -\"it's your heart and mind\"). This is trying to resemble a Wong Kar Wai film with the crucial difference that the sadness and longing feel artificial, not the result of personal conviction but rather that these ideas would look good on the film. That may be because KJW relishes the bloodshed. No other part of the film receives the care and attention of the scenes of violence.Yet by the end of it, KJW isn't satisfied with a crime flick where blood gushes out of bullet holes (of which it's a good one), he wants emotion to pour out of the finale. For all this to work for me, for me to be able to acquiesce to the experience as something worth opening myself to, I need to hear the film play itself. Like a music instrument, a film that plays itself is music to my ears, good or bad at least it's an effort. I want to be able to see the film absorbed by its music like it doesn't even matter I'm there. KJW's film wants to play me, to use me as the music instrument to create emotion. A melancholy piano tunes in the right moment, we get a shot of the protagonist shedding a tear, this fabricated emotion is then cut by the loud bang of a pistol. To get back to what I wrote above, some films let me determine whether I will be sad or angry, A Bittersweet Life anxiously expects it of me, it's like the film is studying my reactions to see will I shed a tear. To the degree that all films are artifice, it could have something to do with different levels of transparency to that artifice.I don't know if KJW's problem is that he doesn't have obsessions as a filmmaker. This is the third of his films I've actively disliked and all three of them are vastly different to each other. He's good with technique but, like Tarantino, he seems he doesn't have anything personal to share. In place of nothing to exorcize, he seems to pick every time a different genre to stave off boredom. As though anxious to prevent that same boredom in his audience, he fills his movies with passing thrills. At the same time he aspires to more than passing thrills, yet when the time comes for his film to express a conviction that the world is a certain way we get banalities.", "After seeing thousands of Asian films, the tendency for the average viewer is to become jaded. How many revenge movies can one see until the premise get's old? How many Asian \"shocks\" does it take before being the jolts become normal? That being said, every once in a while, a film comes along that rejuvenates my faith in Asian cinema. A film that takes the simple and tired old formula and spins it into a masterpiece of epic proportions. A Bittersweet Life is one of those films. A masterwork of Korean Cinema that doesn't fail to impress even the most jaded viewer and at the same time, doesn't leap into a formulaic revenge flick.The story is simple, Kim Sunwoo is an enforcer for a Korean Mob Boss Mr. Kang. One day, Mr. Kang announces that he'll be leaving for a few days and asks Kim if he'll watch over his mistress while he's gone. Mr. Kang suspects that his mistress has taken another lover and asks Kim to watch over her, and if he happens to catch her in the act, to immediately call him or \"take care of them\". Kim eventually does catch the mistress cheating with another young man. Instead of following his boss' wishes, Kim decides to let them go. When the boss comes back and realizes he's been lied to he tries to have Kim killed. He is unsuccessful and soon all hell breaks loose.A Bittersweet Life is a masterpiece of contemporary Korean Cinema, on par with that of Park-Chan Wook's Oldboy and Bong Joon-ho's Memories of Murder. The central reason for this, would obviously be Kim Ji-Woon's expert direction. Just as he revitalized the Korean Horror genre with a Tale of Two Sisters, he does so with the Korean Gangster flick in A Bittersweet Life. Kim Ji Y also does an excellent job bringing Kim Ji's vision to life and many of the shots in the film border on breathtaking. In particular, the shots filmed in the rain, of exiled Sunwoo, surrounded by a cloud black umbrella's held by Mr. Kang's syndicate are incredible.Another of the film's big strengths is the score. The film's music features Spanish-inspired guitar pieces, techno, pseudo classical violin pieces, and jazzy/salsa influenced guitar riffs and all work perfectly with the film ever changing moods. Indeed, the film's music is almost as important to the whole package as Byung-hun Lee superb performance.And speaking of Byung-hun Lee, he really is the glue that holds the production together. Towards the beginning of the film he plays the role of Sunwoo as a very quiet and subdued, almost pathetic (except for when he has to kick some major ass, which he does in style) but an event about halfway through the film hardens him and he is resurrected into a monster of sorts, one hell-bent on revenge for his former boss.Oh, and who could forget the action? A Bittersweet Life is full of hard, brutal action (the kind I love so much). The film's action is spread liberally throughout the film, unlike much of the other Korean Gangster films which usually only have spattering of violence here and there. Jung Doo Hong's action scenes are no nonsense. There's no flashy Kung-Fu sequences, just brutal realistic fights and gun-play (although, some of it is a bit over the top). The last 20 minutes of the film features a balls to the wall finale, as Sunwoo singlehandedly takes on the entire syndicate in a sequence strongly reminiscent of Brian Depalma's Scarface.Bottom Line- A Bittersweet Life is an unabashed masterpiece of Korean Cinema.", "This is a revenge movie, pure and simple. When it comes to this genre, the protagonist usually has some injustice (loosely used here) done unto him, and therefore unleashes hell upon those who incurred his wrath, who of course, failed to finish him off in the first place.Sun-woo (Lee Byung-hun) is a hotel manager. Or so he seems. On the surface, he's calm, cool and collected. But step out of line, he brings upon his fury without remorse, and without sympathy. His cockiness earns him no admirers, but he gives his utmost loyalty towards his boss, President Kang.He leads a lonely existence without friends, and in his latest mission, strikes a forbidden friendship with his prey that led to his ostracizing from the clan he belongs to. Relying on his personal judgement, in contradiction with his boss's, he consciously interpreted his mission ambiguously, and this led to his downfall. In the mob, as a servant, you do not think, but carry out orders like a faithful dog. Such is his life for seven years, until now.As with revenge films, those who go against you must die, and you soon find yourself up against impossible odds, and with incredible luck. At times the movie stretches its realism to the limit, but for the purpose of good violent fun. The violence is gratuitous - shootings up close, bleeding by the buckets, hand-breaking, fist-fighting, at times making the audience cringe at too much crimson.But thumbs up for the action pieces, which were well choreographed, especially the escape fight scene (you must learn, never to give a few minutes to a hit-man), and the climatic shoot out finale. Poetry in motion some might add, at times shot like John Woo's slow-motion style with classical music in the background. Various bad characters are up for our anti-hero's dispatch, and you'll find yourself rooting that he does so with as much pain as possible.On the other end of the spectrum, this film also had incredible amounts of silence and non-action, which punctuated between the action sequences well. Sort of like a breather - the calm before the next storm.The relationship element between Sun-woo and Hee-soo (Shin Min-a) however was never fully explored. It was hinted that the cause of the rift between servant and master was the woman, but because of the lack of explicit narrative and dialogue, this was never brought across in a clear manner, and left open to interpretation. Another element that somewhat fell flat was the forced attempts to inject humour with bumbling characters. Felt a bit out of place and the pacing suffered a tad bit.Nonetheless, as a revenge movie, this film delivered. But there's somewhat a nagging thought in me that it could, and should have reached its full potential given the superb cast, stylish action and of course, bloody violence.", "This movie delivers on gangster action and torture scenes but flops on the love side of the story and the plot twists. This is a linear movie where you almost know the end before it starts and are just watching to see the details of how it goes. It's well shot, well cast but no story to speak of that would keep your attention. What I liked in this movie was some of fight scenes were a bit rough and crude and not as dance-like while others were very slick- it gave a good feel for the different ways a fight can go down.PLOT: A man's world goes all to crap in the gangster business and he can't seem to figure out why even though the answer is so obvious. Asian fight scenes and automatic weaponry with a fetish for knives abounds. Other movies do the same thing better such as \"hard boiled\"- one of the classics. Sure I think that was Chinese and not Korean but.. hey.. bullets is bullets.", "A Korean gangster flick that excels in every aspect. It deals with a right hand man who is supposed to follow the boss's girlfriend and report any suspicious activities. He catches her having an affair and doesn't say anything. Another crime family is persisting that he apologize for beating some of their members. These things all come to a head resulting in one hell of a showdown.The same director who did I Saw The Devil (2010) brings us this masterpiece. It has John Woo type action with an incredible score. It does have an Oldboy feel and near the end you can see the influences of Scarface (1983). Clocking in at two hours this is one fast paced ride full of imagery. You won't find much wrong with this one so enjoy.", "This is how mafia films should be and how I love them. Since its Korean obviously a little raw,sharp Round the edges and leaves you with a sour taste in taste in your mouth. Along with the obligatory oh what did I just watch moment. Haven't seen such a fine mafia film for a while, while Hollywood tries to turn Mafia films in summer block busters Korea is still doing it right. The difference between a modern Hollywood thriller and Korean cinema is that you question yourself is he going to live, is he? And often you are (un) pleasantly surprised.The film follows a crime boss and his enforcer, who happens to be a man of honor in his own sense and not a big fan of well words. The film is a single story line but branches off, rivalry between different mafia houses, the chiefs girlfriend, the enforcer, love, revenge, a whole lot of kicking ass and broken bones. But simply put its a story about doing what's right and love, more importantly this still is a better love story than twilight. Not a lot of films in this genre leave a big smile on your face when they end this with its irony does.The other major difference would be feeling empathy, while Sundance and other festival showcase the hard hitting dramas of Hollywood, pick a Korean action film and it still would make you feel something.The cinematography is phenomenal it doesn't go crazy with color tones and doesn't care much about CGI its all really nicely thought out shots and well done stunts. There are some gorgeous frames that you don't see everyday and the way they show you something happening without explaining the whole thing or body is just beautiful.Bonus points for gangster film with no nudity and well there is gore lots of it, you don't like blood? This one isn't for you.The action is paced really nicely there are buildups and then serene moments. If raid is action films headliners done right this is raid without the red bull. Music is a bit of a let down but makes up for it with a great sound mix.This one definitely goes in my must watch list.

However, it didn't progress as good as expected. The first episodes were really good, with the romance developing in slow tempo and the drama being highlighted with the struggles of the inspiring students who want to debut as a band. However, the drama started falling apart after the first half. The romance was not as strong, as the guy constantly made the girl cry, and the girl simply and very idiotically, for me at least, kept coming back. There as a nice love triangle, that, again, couldn't be developed because clearly the girl was obsessed over her first love interest. The performances were okay, but not as good as they could have been, and the songs were nice.

Right away we know this isn't going to be an active story but a passive one that is revealed through the telling of various stories. This kind of technique isn't that uncommon and it can result in effective engagement, but that didn't happen here. As the man tells his story, the homeless woman is introduced. She in turn, within the story that the man is telling, has to tell her story so we understand who she is and why she's in his story. Her story introduces us to another character who has to have a story and the net effect of this is that the film never gets out of background mode until the very end where the clich\u00e9 of love that arrives after death has intervened to make it impossible, attempts to tickle our heartstrings and make us forget we really don't care.Kang Hye-jeong is a wonderful actress and is almost able to make something of her character but she isn't given enough raw material to get completely there. This film relies on background stories for its grill so she is required to be a twenty-something hobo for most of the film and then a high school kid for some of the background. I don't know what it is about her face but she is able to believably portray a realistic looking teenager. This film is only for devoted fans of hers who must see every minute they can of her on the big screen. It is not recommended for anyone looking to see a good movie."], "1170": ["This is a 16 episode, approximately 17 hours in length Koran drama about a 39 year old lady named Shanxi (Choi Jin-Shil) who meets up again with her very first love, the very popular actor Zaibin (Jeong Jun-Ho). Shanxi's caddish husband was put in jail for shady business dealings and is bailed out by a pretty, older lady. He tricks Shanxi into divorcing him. She ends up becoming the housekeeper to Zaibin, his agent brother who is more about expressions than words and 15 year old Xun. Shanxi has a similarly aged daughter Zhimin who, not knowing Zaibin was his mom's first love (Shanxi is the only person outside of the family who knows his real age-for the fans he shaved 7 years off his real age), is all cute and awed by him. This is primarily a drama, but there are little comic moments. Choi Jin-Shin bears the burden of her character terrificly, and this is a very watchable drama. The complaint I have is fairly minor: Bad English subtitles at times (sometimes you have no idea what the characters mean, the English translation makes little sense). However, this doesn't detract from what is an enjoyable, compelling drama about fame, love and understanding. This has less to do with the drama but it needs to be said for Chio Jin-Shil fans. This drama is sometimes a sad, ironic tale given the untimely death of Ms. Jin-Shil by her own hand on October 2, 2008. The depiction of the media, the annoyances of the ever present cameras and need to know (hence the title of the drama, an unfortunate title given the tumult of Ms. Jin-Shil's life before her death), could make you feel a little regret watching this. Don't think about that, celebrate her character and fairly impressive acting and have fun and feel its a worthy drama for your viewing. I recommend it highly."], "1171": [], "1172": [], "1173": [], "1174": ["Not to be confused with another late 2000's South Korean with the same name, 2008's I am Happy. 2009's I am Happy didn't make me happy. I wasn't really glad with how the South Korean film turn out. Loosely inspired by author Lee Cheong-Jonn's short novel 'Mr. Cho, Man-deuk'; which tells the story of two people living life at a Korean psychiatric ward. This movie directed & written by Yoon Jong-Chan slightly change the novel's story plot to something else; which in return, cause this film to end up, more like a mess than a masterpiece. The movie tells the story of two people; Cho Man-su (Hyun-Bin) a patient suffering from a mental illness & his nurse, Soo-kyung (Lee Bo-young). Both are painfully going through some issues, due to the fact, that other people dependent on them. In Cho Man-Su's case, he was deeply mistreat by his mother suffering from dementia and his brother addicted to gambling to the point, that he turned crazy. For Soo-Kyung, the stress of her work, added to the pressure of taking care of her serious ill, father is causing her to go into a deep depression. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I really didn't like how this movie was market in the United States, as romantic comedy when it clearly not. There is barely any sign of romance in the film at all, between the two main characters. I don't think the main guy even develops a crush on the girl at all. The same with the woman. I never saw the relationship being more than Nurse-Patient relationship. So, it was odd to see it, market as more than that. If you're looking for Hyun Bin to be the handsome leading man in a romantic comedy like his 2005's TV show 'My Lovely Sam-Soon' or 2010's 'The Secret Garden', then you will be sorely disappointed by 'I am Happy'. There isn't even any really funny moments for him to shine in. In truth, there isn't anything, but heartbreaking moments. It was very misleading. That's false advertising, big time! I don't know, why they had to lie, to make audiences want to see it. The movie was still somewhat compelling to watch, with its psychological melodrama. If, there is anything good, about it, the acting wasn't that bad. Yes, the movie has a lot more slow and dull moments, where the actors does nothing, but stare like mindless zombies, but at least, there are some instants, where each of their character can really stand out and shine. Sadly, those intense emotional moments are far too little. Most of the movie is endless amount of talking scenes; which had dialogue that was mostly boring. The pacing for this film is also horrible. It really talks forever to tell, the story of these two. Hardly any action going on. Added to the pressure, is weird way, the film intercuts flashbacks. It's so confusing; one minute, Cho Man-Su in the hospital, the next minute, he's running a car repair shop, another second, he's getting out of the hospital. The movie is full of odd place scenes like that. There is no sense of story-structure. The movie is also missing a lot of exposition scenes as well. I can see the extent to which a brother with a gambling addiction and mother with dementia could send him over the edge, however, honestly, I still don't know, how Cho Man-Su came under the delusion that he was a Swiss Millionaire. It seem like he had no idea, where Switzerland, was before this, nor did he shown any interest in being a millionaire, before then. So where did he get the idea? I also don't get, how his story, relations to the nurse's story. Yes, both people are dealing with illness, but dealing with mental illness is way difference than physical illness. There is hardly any connection with the two story concept. The movie even lose focus at times. One scene, has Man-Su trying to stand up against shock therapy as if he is Randle McMurphy from 1975's One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. This over-sense of rebellion, seem a little too out of character for him, even as a crazy guy. It really comes out of nowhere. Also, the sense that he's happy with his craziness is not really established, well. I didn't sense that he was happy with all the blank staring at walls. So I don't get it. Overall: This film is so poorly written that it just end up being uber-confusing and way too long and depressing to enjoy. Not a great watch.

But this detective is also on a quest to exact revenge on the man who violently ruined his family's life 20 years ago. The journey will inevitably take some unexpected turns. This is a film that may divide audiences, due to its off-kilter approach to a number of different genres, time periods and visual styles, using the framework of a hard- boiled detective story to metaphorically glance at various hardships Korea has endured over the past 100 years. It takes a little while for the film's rhythm to take hold, but once it does and you completely click into its particular point-of-view, it becomes more entertaining as it goes on. Writer/director Jo Sung-hee, who impressed with the minimalist, post-apocalyptic END OF ANIMAL and the romance/drama/fantasy A WEREWOLF BOY, again moves down a different path, with a film that is heavily influenced by comic books and pulp crime novels. His smart blend of camera technique, lighting schemes, CGI animation, and set design makes this a feast for the eyes, and if it is screening at a cinema nearby, then I highly recommend that you go and experience it on the big screen.Lee Je-hoon, who caught people's attention with his performances in the first-rate but appropriately titled BLEAK NIGHT and the acclaimed Korean War drama THE FRONT LINE, is very good as detective Gil-dong, and the relationship that develops between he and the two girls is genuinely affecting. However, he doesn't quite command the screen in the way needed to make a film like this truly soar (say like Park Hae-il), but on the strength of his work here, you know that day is not far away. Kim Seong-gyoon proves intimidating as the brutal Kang Sung-il, but the film is stolen by young actors Kim Ha-na (as Mal-soon) and No Jeong-ee (as Dong-yi), who are utterly charming as Gil-dong's hindrance-come-helpers. The director gets remarkably natural and confident performances from the two youngsters, thankfully free of cloyingly sweet mannerisms and cheap sentimentality.The less you know about the plot details the better, as Jo Sung-hee's final vision may be somewhat contrary to what you might be expecting. But it's a surprise that definitely leaves a smile on your face when the end credits begin to roll, and has you already looking forward to what this talented film-maker will do next.", "Hong Gil-dong (Lee Je-hoon) is a detective with a mission: to find the man who murdered his mother in front of his childhood self and avenge her death. For years, he has worked as a detective in the large organization headed by the sister of the wealthy family that adopted him, learning the skills he needs to track this killer down. When he finally has his target in sight, however, members of a mysterious gang kidnap the man, leaving his two young granddaughters distraught and not sure where to turn. Hong tells the girls that he can find their relative, but he needs them to come with him on the journey, and so the three set off together. The girls hope Hong will save their grandfather, but they don't know the reason he's hunting him\u0085. That's a very brief description of the set-up of this extremely convoluted story; there are more twists and turns here than I've seen in a film in a very long time! Nobody is who they seem to be and nobody's motives are what they appear. Well, except maybe for the two girls - I wish I knew the names of the child actors, who are excellent (particularly the 8-year-old, perpetually snot-faced, younger kid). There's an awful lot to like in this movie, both because of its hard-boiled aspect, its tender one and its sheer over-the-top action. One thing I'm not sure of is its time frame; there are references (visual and otherwise) to the 1980s, but the clothing and cars, among other indications, seem to hark back to the 1930s. If that anachronistic visualization doesn't derail you, however, you're in for a heck of a packed, exciting and ultimately satisfying two hours!", "Note: Check me out as the \"Asian Movie Enthusiast\" on YouTube, where I review tons of Asian movies.Our protagonist (a detective, of course) works day-to-day to track down missing persons. One day, he finally finds the man who murdered his mother (when he was a child), but the murderer gets kidnapped and the detective must track down the criminals responsible. At the same time, however, he is forced to watch over two little girls (the murderer's grandchildren) who are tagging along for the ride. Unfortunately, the kidnappers work for a shadowy organization that has no qualms about eliminating anyone who stands in their way.This movie has a very noir-ish feel to it, with a lot of investigation that leads our protagonist from place to place as he narrates his thoughts. He even wears the old school detective hat and coat, which gives him a classical look. The lead actor is Je-hoon Lee, who previously starred in \"Bleak Night\" and appeared in \"The Front Line\" (both of which are very good movies, by the way). \"The Phantom Detective\" provides even more evidence that this guy can legitimately carry a movie. He does a good job of portraying a man who is proficient at his job, but is still vulnerable and can get in over his head.The dynamic between him and the girls is somewhat unorthodox. However, it's also endearing because the kids don't immediately know that he wants to take revenge on their grandfather, but they do figure out fairly early on that he is a habitual liar \u2013 and this gives some leeway for the filmmakers to pepper in some humorous exchanges of dialogue between them. In addition, one of the girls breaks out a notepad and takes down information while he questions people, almost as if she were a detective herself. This is entertaining stuff that safely avoids the \"annoying little kid\" clich\u00e9 that can really hurt a movie. So basically, there are no weak points when considering the acting in this movie \u2013 everyone holds their own.In terms of action \u2013 there are a handful of gun battles and fist fights, none of which are graphically violent, but they do have a hard-hitting feel to them that adds a weight and danger to everything. The action design has a \"higher octane\" feel to it, without the need for going over the top or chucking in cartoonish set pieces. Everything is grounded here, and that's important in this case due to the tone and type of film we're dealing with. Sure, we have three likable leads, but there are some dangerous people in this movie. One such person is the main bad guy, who makes multiple appearances throughout as he stalks the protagonists. And let me tell you, he's one tough son-of-a-gun too. Now, I won't spoil the ending for you, but what I will say is that it's very satisfying.There are a few stylistic flourishes that are used for the buildings and environments at times, which utilize some artificial visuals. I know some critics have complained a bit about these particular special effects, but I thought it was a neat idea that gave this film some charm. You know, I have to say, \"The Phantom Detective\" feels like something that would have come out of U.S. during the 1990s. This is the kind of movie that Hollywood doesn't like to make anymore. And I definitely recommend it.", "At the beginning I was reluctant to watch it.

They will see a parallel to their own situation. From a difficult relationship between a father and a son, to a mother trying to balance her need to find a new partner and her duty towards her daughters.To me it was the start of the boyfriend-girlfriend relationship between EunChan and KanKyul. It mirrors my own experience so closely. The calling game, the little games you play with each other that could lead to misunderstandings and fights. And all this because you are afraid of the strong feelings you have for another person. Not knowing how to express it or how the other person feels about you. The beautiful thing is...they take there time to portray this and it works real well.Where Hollywood stops with just the love story, this shows continues exploring and portraying the relationship behind the lovestory.I can't recommend this how highly enough. A must see.", "The First Shop Of Coffee Prince is about the life of Go Eun Chan.It is not easy; she works many jobs to pay off debts and even gave up her feminine image. Choi Han Kyul is the heir of a big food company, but his grandmother wants him to settle down, so she arranged many dates for him. After Eun Chan bumped into Han Kyul and was mistaken for a boy, Han Kyul decided to hire Eun Chan to be his gay lover in order to avoid the arranged dates. Desperately in need of money, Eun Chan had no choice but to accept. Han Kyul's grandmother also made Han Kyul in charge of a filthy coffee shop in danger of being bankrupt. Eun Chan begged to work at the coffee shop, and not long after, feelings start to spark, except, how would Han Kyul accept his \"homosexuality\"?It took me a while to get into this drama as I felt that it dragged in its early episodes. But as I went through viewing it, there is no doubt that this is a CLASSIC DRAMA. The First Shop of the Coffee Prince provides refreshing themes about homosexuality, self-sacrifice, hard work,dreams,ambition,success,emotional and psychological issues that one may face in life. The story is one-of-a-kind and not your typical Asian drama.Yoon Eun Hye,playing the tomboyish Eun Chan, played her role extremely well. Her chemistry with Goong Yoo, who played the confused Choi Han Kyul,is commendable too. Their chemistry was excellent. Both deserved their MBC acting awards for their work in this drama. The supporting cast is commendable as well. Aside from that, the soundtrack was magnificent. A must-see Korean drama!!!!!!", "Let's start off with the weirdest thing. I'm Dutch, have no relationship with anything or anyone Korean, I just like Anime and J-Pop/K-pop. While browsing through Netflix I came upon this gem. When I started first watching this show, about a week ago, I thought \"fudge it\". I never saw a Korean TV-series before with real actors, apart from the occasional Korean movie involving lots of fighting. \"Coffee Prince\" was my first encounter with a Korean TV-series and boy, what a treat this is!As other reviewers have explained, this is all about the girl- needs-job, pretends-to-be-boy, falls-for-boss. The amazing thing about it is that these actors actually take you along their fantastic ride. At no point in this series I felt they were over-acting. Every single actor is able to portray his character well and they truly develop throughout the series. This is no As The World Turns. ATWT doesn't even come close. This is real drama. You really feel with these actors, I even forgot they are actors at times! The episodes also take their time, running for an hour or longer which gives the actors and director time to really dig deep into their characters and situations. Characters develop during an episode and even more so over the course of the series.The struggle between the two main characters is a back-and-forth, a push-and-pull. Sometimes a tad annoying because you really want them to work things out and get together. But the things happening to them and in their relationship often provide roadblocks which must be overcome for them to go forward. The ways they deal with those roadblocks are recognizable for a normal human being. Nobody get's shot because they cheated. This is real drama.This series is totally captivating and had me interested until the last second. I only wish they would've made an episode about the marriage of the main characters too (and yes, I'm a man saying that...). It would've been the ultimate ending to the series if you ask me.", "The Coffee Prince shows love can cross boundaries (gender, economic status) and triumph. The love story is beautifully portrayed and makes Coffee Prince worth watching.The two leads embody the main characters perfectly. Gong Yoo plays Choi Han-gyul, a rich aimless man and Yoon Eun-hye plays Go Eun-chan, a hard- working breadwinner for her family. Eun-chan does not look or dress in a feminine fashion and Han-gyul mistakes her for a boy. Their initial relationship is based on Han-gyul paying Eun-chan to act as his boyfriend to repulse the blind dates his Grandmother and Mother set him up with, as they want him to settle down and marry. Han-gyul then is challenged to make a decrepit coffee shop profitable in 3 months (as co-owner) and Eun-chan gets a job in the coffee shop. It is wonderful to watch their ensuing friendship and love blossom. Han-gyul struggles with his love for Eun-chan as it challenges his concepts that love should only between a man- and a woman. The lead actor, Gong Yoo, goes all-in on his character, Han-gyul, playing crucial moments with intensity and elevating the entire drama. The lead actress, Yoon Eun-hye, manages to be sympathetic as her character Eun-chan continues her gender lie longer than necessary. The supporting characters of the drama did not grab me so their on- screen stories were not of much interest, lowering the overall of the effect of Coffee Prince as a whole. *SPOILER* When Han-gyul finally allows himself to love Eun-chan regardless of gender (episode 10) it is the best moment of the drama and truly touching. *SPOILER* The finale episode is the weakest as we wait too long for the couple to be reunited, but all ends well.", "OK. I watched this show for the first time in 2015. I was 15. I had just been whipped into phase of watching Korean Dramas by one of my good friends. Compared to the first Korean show I watched, which I also loved but for other reasons (Boys Over Flowers), this show seemed so much more genuine. (I have not included spoilers about events but I might have included spoilers about different character's characteristics. If that makes any sense.)First of all, the relationships weren't outlandish. There is no extreme hate between any of the characters in the show. No arch nemesis. The parents/grand parents are more reasonable when it comes to the romance of the main characters than any other K drama I have seen thus far. The supporting relationship in the show is a refreshing, long lasting love between reasonable, authentic adult characters, which, understandably has some hiccups along the way. Second, the characters weren't to the extremes. I have seen so many dramas with bratty chaebol sons who wear expensive clothing and drive fast cars. Han Kyul is rich and spoiled, but his wealth is toned down so that he is a believable character. Eun Chan was believable too. She didn't beat up people twice her size and the actor wasn't fighting too hard to pass as male. She seemed natural and cool. Sure there are some wacky characters in this show, Mr. Hong, Ha Rim, Sun Ki and Min Yeob, but none of them do extremely garish things which ruin the mood of the show. Third, Gong Yoo is just great, isn't he? He is a very handsome individual and I quite like the ensemble of different facial expressions that he can pull (my favorite is the raised eyebrows). Plus, he still looks great ten years later!Fourth, Yun Eun Hye is terrific as this 24 year old tomboy. Her chemistry with Gong Yoo has not been surpassed by anyone in any other the other shows or movies I have seen him in. I must admit, after watching this, I haven't been able to bring myself to watch any other shows that she is in. I see her as such a boy, and without the short hair and masculine tendencies, her performance in other shows and movies always leaves me feeling a bit empty.The plot kept me on the edge of my seat right up until the end. I'm only docking one point. Half a point because the ending is lacking some, and even though I've watched the show through a few times, I'm always hoping there is something extra that I missed at the end. Plus another half a point for the scenes which I feel are unnecessary and cumbersome to the plot, like Sun Ki's story (sorry Sun Ki).", "I am not a fan of K-Drama, but am a huge fan of this show. Have watched the entire show 4 times so far and always want to come back to it. The scenes are so original you might think it wasn't in a movie.2007 ~ 2018 and haven't had enough to it. Made me think there was something wrong in me but I'm still fine, I wouldn't mind even if I do though.I don't know about the others, but it hurts so bad to know that there will be no 2nd season to this show. It really hurts.", "All though almost all Korean Dramas are great but this One of the best out there. Must watch for all.", "This was the very first Korean drama I watched. After this one I was hooked! Everything about this K-drama was awesome; the cast, the story, the characters. I will definitely re-watch this one again and again! It will get you hooked! Absolutely loved the ending, too!!!", "I found the first few few episodes annoying.. BUT after the 5th episode, I got hooked.. It is so beautiful, the chemistry between the two main leads is amazing.. Love is love, it has no boundaries..\nWatch it.", "Best kiss ever\nFemale lead is cute and male lead is handsome.\nLove it.", "I first watched this show in 2009 then again in 2010 and I am still so impressed by it .Not only is it a very good Kdrama ,its generally just a very good series/miniseries which can stand its own with any international series out there. Its a comedy (mostly of errors ,mixed up identity and confused emotions) but it has a lot of touching ,sad and heartfelt scenes. It also makes a pretty big statement about romantic love and its basis which had me thinking long after it was over", "Coffee Prince follows the footsteps of so many dramas that have a girl dressed as a boy, but manages to be unique and fresh. And those last two qualities make this drama a classic. First of all, the story: a young girl, who is often confused for a boy, manages to get a job at a cafe, ran by a rich spoiled heir. But, in order to get the job, she needs to pretend to be a boy. All in all, it is an okay film. The main story is interesting and entertaining, though the love triangle wasn't that good, maybe because it ended too soon for the main female lead and therefor it lost its strength early on. Plus, the secondary stories were just there to fill the gaps. Honestly, I thought they will forget about them and never show us what happened to them, but they managed to wrapped them up pretty neatly at the final episode. The romance was okay, though it failed to convince at the ending. Fortunately, the girl didn't miraculously changed into a princess of girly power, as all the other girls do in dramas like this one, but she remained herself and that was the main thing that separates coffee prince from the other dramas. Finally, the plot was just okay, with the episodes sometimes being a little boring, as the action didn't precede."], "1224": [], "1225": [], "1226": [], "1227": [], "1228": [], "1229": ["Easy to say that I'm not much of action-flick fan but I'll give this one a try because of Jung-jae Lee and Ji-woo Choi. It has garnered much attention in So. Korea before it's official release and one of the most anticipated drama of the year. The story took us to the daily behind the scene work of airport personnel. The struggle they have to face while making sure the passengers are safe.The starting was fine for me and I'm willing to sit through and give it a chance to make up until the end of the pilot episode. And I was kind of disappointed. I barely watch the next episodes and couldn't find a reason strong enough to continue.Though, of course, I don't really know much about acting and I can only say it from a viewer's perspective. Jung-jae Lee acting has always leave an impression. Ji-woo Choi acting was pretty much the same as in Winter Sonata. I was hoping to see a different side of her. Jin-wook Lee role was quite good but I wish he would have more facial expression.Overall, I give it a 7 for effort done on researching the real issues dealing with airport security but nonetheless, a drama should be dramatic at some point.

Yes it is, and yes it does.But this isn't a Hollywood slasher flick. The kills in this movie are not gratifying and aren't meant to be. The women being killed are not scantily clad models running through forests from men wearing masks. There is nothing pleasant or \"cool\" about these scenes; they make the viewer uncomfortable, they unsettle, they bring one's mind into very dark places. It gives us a peek into the madness that every man is capable of, and does so realistically and without pulling its punches. This brutal realism makes people uncomfortable, and prompts negative reviews. This is understandable, but unfortunate. I believe that a movie should be judged on more than the amount of blood the viewer is comfortable seeing on-screen. To these people, please, do not watch Korean revenge thrillers if you are uncomfortable with torture or blood.But enough of that rambling. This movie is excellent. Beautiful cinematography contrasts the stark, dimly lit scenes where the murders, or gritty fight scenes, occur. The camera work is simple but effective; the viewer is often treated to close-ups of both Byung-hun Lee and Mik-sik Choi, and their facial expressions tell us more than dialogue ever could. There is also contrast between Lee and Choi. Lee, clean and stoic, and Choi, filthy and madly expressive. They compliment each other very well, and play off of each others strengths effectively.The story itself is typical of revenge films, but fantastic in its execution. Lee's character experiences a profound loss at the hands of Choi's character, and in the process of seeking revenge begins to resemble the man he so hates. The line between \"victim\" and \"aggressor\" becomes blurred between both characters. This is where the film shines. There is no black and white in \"I Saw the Devil\"; the viewer is left with shades of grey.As for the acting, it was all done very well. As I mentioned, Lee and Choi work well together, and all supporting cast members did an excellent job. Choi portrays his character in an incredibly convincing manner, shifting suddenly from calmness to manic anger, but never in a way that feels unnatural or forced. Lee's character is quiet and much less expressive, but he does very well in showing immense amounts of emotion through just his eyes or subtle movements of his body. A memorable performance from them both.As for flaws, the only thing I can think of is the strange, perhaps unrealistic behaviour of the police. Lee is a member of the NIS, and is very skilled when it comes to remaining hidden, but that shouldn't make him untouchable when directly provoking police officers or driving on the wrong side of the street. Still, though, it's a very trivial complaint that isn't worth a deducted point.A confident 10/10 from me. If you are comfortable seeing serial murder portrayed realistically, and are able to appreciate more than just gore, please, do yourself a favour and watch this film.", "This movie is not for the squeamish, or the faint of heart. Censors claimed it was offensive to human dignity. These were the kinds of things they told the audience at the world premiere screening of the Uncut Version of I Saw the Devil at the Toronto International Film Festival last week. I had heard the movie was pretty graphic, but I never expected that it would push any boundaries. I turned out to be only half right. After finding out his fianc\u00e9e has been brutally murdered, secret agent Dae-hoon (Byung-hun Lee) is at a loss. With the help of his father-in-law, he sets out on a revenge plot to find the man who did it. He quickly finds the culprit, Kyung-chul (Min-sik Choi). He beats him pretty badly, but instead of killing him, he leaves him alive. He wants to stalk his prey, and exact his revenge slowly and increasingly more painfully.Going in with very few ideas of what I was about to see, I was startled and thrilled at the tenacious audacity on display from the opening scene all the way until the final frames. The film is a gritty, merciless experience that could never be truly recreated in North America. This is the kind of hard-boiled revenge thriller you could only find in Korea. And to hear that even the censors there could not handle Kim Ji-woon's complete vision makes the film all the more uncompromising and astounding. It has taken me well over a week to try and come up with the words to describe and review the film, but never once have I forgotten anything I saw. It is quite simply, unforgettable.I was right in assuming the film would not push the boundaries of what can be shown in regards to graphic violence and gore. But it comes really close. It makes Park Chan-Wook's entire Vengeance Trilogy look about as violent as the Toy Story Trilogy. Blood sprays, flies, drips, gushes \u2013 every verb or way blood can possibly flow out of the human body occurs over the course of the film. It relishes in it no matter if the shot is raw, unflinching and real, or hyper stylized and completely over-the-top. One sequence involving a brutal double murder as the camera swoops around the scene in a circle is simply magnificent to watch, both to see how much blood is spilt and for how wicked and incredible a shot it is.The revenge tale at the core of I Saw the Devil is not all too original, but it is the story and idea around it that is. Very rarely do we see a film with two characters that start off completely different, but very slowly become all in the same. Dae-hoon and Kyung-chul are both very stubborn individuals, who will not back down from each other. They just keep at each other, and even as Kyung-chul is continually beaten, abused and victimized, he never once lets up. I keep coming back to a comparison with Batman and The Joker in The Dark Knight, and how those two menaces push each other to their physical limits, and that is exactly what happens in this film. While it was easy to pick sides in Dark Knight, Ji-woon makes it increasingly difficult for the audience to figure out who they should sympathize with here. It is a haunting and blatantly moral-defying story, and its raw and emotional undertones are more than difficult to swallow.But the key problem I found with the film is Ji-woon's lack of ability to know when to cut. There are easily twenty minutes that could be chopped right out of the film, and none of its edge would be lost in the process. I was glued to the screen for the majority of the film, but found myself checking my watch more than once because I was totally baffled as to why it runs over 140 minutes. There is only so much revenge one can take and comprehend, and having the film run so long makes it all too easy to call out as being self-indulgent. I respect the film, and I respect Ji-woon as a filmmaker (I wanted to seek out the rest of his film catalogue immediately after the lights came up), but it just makes such an incredible movie feel a bit sloppy and weakened as a cohesive package.Another inconsistent element is Lee's Dan-hoon. We never learn much about him outside of his being a secret agent and wanting to inflict as much pain as he can through his revenge scheme. So how are we to assume he was not a sick and twisted individual in the first place? How are we to know this is not his first time inflicting such a painful revenge? He rarely speaks, and his cold, calculating eyes never once give us a hint of any further development. It is a great performance by Lee, but it is one that feels very underdeveloped \u2013 outside of some rather obvious sequences.But then, anyone would look underdeveloped when standing next to Choi. The man gives a performance that is the stuff of legend. He was incredible as the lead in Oldboy as the man who was wronged, and is even better as the wrongdoer here. He brings out the monster in Kyung-chul all too easily, and his riveting performance is unmissable. The transformation into this disgusting, psychopathic creature is nothing short of amazing. He chews up scenery at every turn, and is magnetic on screen. Nothing even comes close to equaling the power, intensity and dare I say authenticity he puts into this character. He is the stuff of nightmares.I Saw the Devil is a great revenge thriller, but is far from perfect. Choi's electric performance alone should become required viewing for anyone with any interest in film.8/10.(An edited version of this review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).", "I Saw The Devil is a bloody masterpiece. Jee-woon Kim has proved himself to be a master storyteller. Beautiful shots, a creative script, perfect acting and intense violence make I Saw The Devil a must-see movie for anyone who calls themselves a horror fan.It's a breath of fresh air in a seemingly stagnant genre full of the same old vampire and zombie stories being retold over and over. And yes, there have been loads of revenge movies before, but I Saw The Devil takes it to the next level.Gritty, dark, gory and original: I loved this movie, and I don't like anything. I just hope an American company doesn't comes along to make a shallow remake (Let The Right One In).", "The plot of \"I Saw the Devil\" revolves around a detective whose beautiful fianc\u00e9e is savagely murdered by a vicious psychopath played by \"Oldboy\" himself Min-Sik Choy.Despairing cop quickly tracks down the psycho,tortures him a little and lets him free to play his own gruesome catch-and-release game...Hauntingy beautiful and sickeningly violent thriller from the director of mesmerizing \"A Tale of Two Sisters\".The cinematography is gorgeous,the action is hypnotic and the murders are savage and unrelenting.The plot is extremely dark and demented,so I was utterly enthralled.You will feel pain,agony and sadness in every inch of your body during \"I Saw the Devil\".The best serial killer movie since \"The Silence of the Lambs\".Watch it in pair with Gerald Kargl's \"Angst\" and be amazed.9 serial killers out of 10.", "Just came back from the TIFF 10 screening of the UNCUT version of this film, and after reading the very first review posted here, I feel somewhat compelled to leave a short comment.the movie is about revenge. a woman is murdered by a serial killer, the woman's soon-to-be husband, who happens be a highly trained special agent, takes revenge on the serial killer in some of the most gruesome ways ever presented on film.The \"TAKEN\"-esque plot is fairly straight forward and even predictable at times, for some people, this unfortunately exposes the violence and turns it into a dominating theme, hence remarks of it being mindless and unnecessary are brought up.But fans of this genre can easily see past the violence, and be drawn back to the noir nature of the film with each passing violence \"segement\", in the end, you can feel the main character's will for revenge, and that simply transcends the violence, and ultimately turns the film into an imaginative commentary on the human condition.the film would also remind you of classic Fincher films, namely se7en, however, the theatrical construction of plot is a signature Ji Woon Kim style, the mise-en-scene, the soundtrack, you see it in every single film of his, especially bittersweet life.after watching this film I found myself immediately comparing it to another masterpiece sympathy for mr.vengeance, so for those of you who have seen chan wook park's revenge trilogy and loved it, you should find time to see this film.", "Are most revenge stories totally complete? Is Hammurabi's Code not good enough? An eye for an eye, a life for a life? 'I Saw the Devil' doesn't think so, and I have to agree.With top Korean names as Ji-Woon Kim (A Bittersweet Life, Tale of Two Sisters), Byung-hun Lee (A Bittersweet Life) and the always amazing Min-Sik Choi (everything), this film had some lofty expectations, and I can easily say that whatever expectations I had, they were smashed, bashed, and slashed into smithereens and finally, thrown out the window. Wronged by the blood-thirsty psycho Choi, Agent Byhung takes vengeance into his own hands in unrelenting fashion. And boy howdy, we got some serious, flesh-ripping and bone-shattering revenge here. Mix in great direction, cinematography, choreography, music, and, of course, dynamite acting, you've got one fantastic flick.Not long into the film, I began to wonder if Min-Sik Choi was delivering one of the all-time anti-hero performances, and for a minute or two, I was definitely thinking that this was the case. However, those anti-hero thoughts were quickly dashed away - he's straight up evil. Always the reliable actor, Min-Sik may have out-done himself; he successfully transformed into one of cinema's most memorable serial killer/villains. Beyond wishing for a stronger emotional impact, this film is just perfect stuff in my eyes. Serial killer movies are being made brilliantly by our beloved brothers from South Korea, and I thank them from the bottom of my heart with big hugs and kisses.", "This movie is probably the heaviest one I have ever seen in terms of mental and physical brutality even though I know movies that touch me even more. Anybody that has problems with torture scenes, cannibalism, violations and explicit sexual content as well as repetitive harsh language should stop reading here and lock for something else. Anybody else is invited to watch a movie about a monster you have never seen before.The movie turns around the question if one can and if so, how one could fight a monster. If two monsters fight each other can there be a winner and what are the consequences for other involved people. The movie hides in fact a lot of philosophical content and depth beneath the surface of blood and gore and is less superficial than it might seem at first sight.The movie is comparable to the story of the great Korean vengeance trilogy around \"Sympathy for Mister Vengeance\", \"Oldboy\" and \"Lady Vengeance\". It has the same harsh language and great acting as the Korean crime masterpiece \"Memories of murder\". It has the same philosophical content as the Canadian \"Les sept jours du talion\". Those movies can be references but this flick isn't comparable to any Hollywood production. This movie is also much heavier than any of the mentioned movies and something like that could only be a success in a country like Korea because it would be cut or banned in Europe or North America. Be sure to catch the uncut version no matter how high the price because it's really worth it.This movie doesn't only live from its shocking and gripping story and the numerous brutal scenes but also from the amazing acting. Choi Min-sik is one of Korea's greatest actors as he proved in \"Oldboy\" or \"Lady Vengenace\" but this time he is even more perfect than I expected. He plays his role with so much credibility and precision and is easily the best interpretation of a serial killer I have ever seen in a movie. Lee Byung-hun plays in a credible way a man that must become a monster to realize his promise and his revenge and he perfectly plays a broken person that goes through extreme changes. The other actors also deliver a more than solid job and remain credible. I must underline the acting of the weird cannibal friend of the monster and his strange wife (you should absolutely check out the deleted scenes).The director also did a great and very detailed job. The acting is perfect, the settings work very well and a great atmosphere is created. Kim Jee-won already created the dark, calm and mind-blowing masterpiece \"A tale of two sisters\" and he shows in here that he can also create a heavy, pitiless and extreme movie like this. I happen to estimate him higher and higher and want to check out the rest of his movies.In the end, this movie isn't maybe as gripping and stunningly original as my favourite Korean flicks \"Oldboy\", \"A tale of two sisters\" or \"Memories of murder\" but it surely is a movie you should check out if you like modern Asian cinema and if you liked the movies I've listed up in this review. It's a little masterpiece you won't forget after you have seen it and it's probably the best movie of the year to me. I would say that this movie underlines my opinion that the Korean cinema has become the best in the world during the last years.", "When Joo-yeon (San-ha Oh) has a flat tire on the snow, she calls the tow truck to help her and calls her beloved fianc\u00e9 Kim Soo-hyeon (Byung-hun Lee), who is a secret agent, to kill time. Out of the blue, a man offers to help her and Joo-yeon refuses. But the man breaks her car, abducts her and dismember her body. Her father, who is a retired chief of police, gives the data of the four prime suspects to Soo- hyeon and he asks two week off to his chief. He hunts the men down and when he finds that Kyung-chul (Min-sik Choi) is the killer, he promises a dreadful to revenge against the killer to make him suffer as Joo- yeon did. Soo-hyeon becomes a monster and begins a cat-and- mouse game, capturing and releasing Kyung-chul wounded many times. But the serial-killer is the personification of evil and makes Soo-hyeon regret for not killing him when he had the chance.\"Ang-ma-reul bo-at-da\", a.k.a. \"I Saw the Devil\", is a brutal South- Korean thriller with a story of revenge. The plot follows the creepy line of \"Seven\" and \"Silence of the Lambs\", but Kyung-chul makes John Doe and Dr. Hannibal Lecter seem to be in the kindergarten of crime. The viewer does not feel the 2h 21min running time of the suspenseful and haunting story. The direction, performances, cinematography, camera work, locations, resuming, everything is top-notch in this film. Fortunately there is no American remake of this film. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Eu Vi o Diabo\" (\"I Saw the Devil\")", "First and foremost, much of this movie borders on, for lack of a better word, the obscene. There are plenty of scenes that bring to mind soft-core pornography, and the violence is incredibly gory and at times, over the top. Some of the actions performed on screen will make most viewers squirm uncomfortably, while a vast majority of those that aren't will let the audience's mind drift to some very, very scary places. In short, its a visceral thriller. The movie is essentially driven by both lead characters trying to inflict as much pain and terror in one another as possible. Unlike most serial killer/crime thrillers, both the two characters collide (in violent, brutal fashion) with one another many, many times, leaving each other bloodied and eager for the next encounter. During these scenes, the movie takes on an unexpected action tone, with plenty of engaging fights that include knives, scythes, screwdrivers and in one scene, a fire extinguisher. In between these scenes the audience is shown the full depravity of the serial killer's psychopathic nature, who pretty much succeeds on setting the bar for on screen insanity.If this sounds like a mindless action/thriller summer film, you'd be mistaken. Both Choi M.S and Lee B.H deliver great performances, with Choi in particular acting disturbingly convincing as a completely unhinged maniac. The plot, although somewhat predictable, is nonetheless entertaining and once set in motion, incredibly gripping. There are plenty of cheap \"boo! gotcha\" scares, but some scenes are masterfully crafted to generate a LOT of tension. Believe me when I say that there were plenty of scenes where you could literally see that the rest of the audience wasn't even breathing, much less moving. As mentioned earlier, the action scenes are shot surprisingly well, and there's a certain pleasure to be derived from watching the hunter become hunted... and in such an exquisite, effective and merciless manner.On an aside, the movie seems to have remake potential with Hollywood production. Perhaps starring Will Smith and Robert Downey Jr. (as a serial killer? wouldn't you be terrified?), with maybe... Danny Boyle at the helm? Hopefully the movie does well enough in its release to receive any considerations.", "Prior to my screening on I Saw the Devil at the Toronto International  Film Festival, all I knew about the film was the one sentence provided  to me by IMDb.com: A secret agent tracks a serial killer who murdered  his fianc\u00e9e.  But I did know that the film was directed by Ji-woon Kim who helmed  last year's brilliant, the Good, The Bad and The Weird. And on the  strength of that resume entry alone, I secured tickets to I Saw the  Devil.  To say that I wasn't prepared for what I was about to screen was an  understatement. And I certainly wasn't prepared to comment that I Saw  the Devil is the best film about a serial killer since Se7en.  The film begins with the serial killer abducting a female victim. After  nearly destroying her head with a hammer, he dismembers her and  disposes of the various body parts.  A search ensues, and her head is found is shallow waters. We learn that  the murdered young girl was the fianc\u00e9e of Kim So-Hyun who happens to  be some kind of Special Service bodyguard. She also was the daughter of  the former Chief of Police.  Kim So-Hyun abruptly takes two weeks off work and begins a manhunt for  his finances killer. He has narrowed it down to four possibilities and  after roughing up the first two (multiple wrench blows to the nuts) he  focuses on his third suspect named Kang.  We know from the opening scene that Kang is indeed the killer and when  Kim So-Hyun breaks into his home, he realizes he has found his man.  But instead of turning Kang over to justice, Kim decides that he will  beat, torture and then release Kang over and over again tormenting him  without peace. A transmitter swallowed unwillingly by Kang allows Kim  to follow his every move.  The next reels of film will follow as Kim dispels some incredibly  violent and bloody vengeance on Kang. Using everything from rocks to  plastic bags to fire extinguishers and fish hooks, Kim will enter  Kang's life, beat him near death, then leave him to his wounds only to  hunt him down and beat him some more.  The scenes of the beatings are not for the faint of heart as I Saw the  Devil is not for the squeamish. I scalpel to the foot and the cutting  of the Achilles tendon got the biggest reaction from the crowd, but  there is enough blood and torture afflicted here to give anyone  nightmares.  Ji-woon Kim brilliantly weaves a tale that has not been shown in film  before. Our two leads meet each other early in the film whereas most  serial killer films don't pit the law and the maniac on the screen  together until the final act. Kim clearly has the upper hand until a  turn of events allow Kang to again strike back. It's like two  heavyweight boxers standing in the ring going toe-to-toe in a crowd  pleasing match of heavy blows.  And just when Kang takes control again and tries to surrender to  police, Kim again finds a way to avenge his family.  Byung-hun Lee as Kim and Min-sik Choi as Kang, are brilliantly cast and  bring an energy to the screen that is maintained through the 144  minutes of the uncut edit. The supporting cast which essentially  involves further Kang victims or unsavory characters that deserve their  fates, do just enough to distract us from the brutality of the  one-on-one battle and allow us to catch our breath (barely) before the  carnage begins anew.  It's been a while since I have been so invigorated and involved in a  film such as I Saw the Devil that I wanted to climb the highest  mountain and sing its praises, but this film delivers the goods. Rarely  do you find an audience involved with that much violence on screen,  cheering and applauding when a character utters, \"I'm far from done\"  during a blood soaked frenzy of activity.  I didn't just see the devil. I saw the best serial killer movie in many  years and clearly one that goes in my Top 5 serial killer films of all  time.", "I SAW THE DEVIL is a brutal, bloody, shocking and very effective crime drama. A psychopath has killed many young girls and when one of them turns out to be the pregnant fianc\u00e9 of a government agent - the agent takes matter into his own hands to track down the killer and make him pay. Now in many American movies, the hero would spend the whole movie tracking the guy down then finally have him cornered on the roof of a skyscraper or the edge of waterfall, etc and then he'd say a corny quip and blow the guy away. But in this amazing Korean film, the agent finds the killer early on and injures him badly and then says \"this is just the beginning\" - planting in this killer's mind the fear that he will come back for him - he doesn't know how or when. The psychological aspect of the hunter and the hunted is very powerful and the performances are incredible. One of the best actors of the planet (Min-sik Choi) who was so brilliant as the lead in OLD BOY, is once again, fantastic as the twisted killer. This movie might not be for everyone - the camera never flinches from any brutality and violence. But the under the surface sorrow and pain of the agent carries the emotional wallop that punches the viewer at the very end.", "For your common or garden movie avenging angel, a bullet in the head is payback enough; others might go so far as to break out the meat-grinder or flamethrower. Nothing quite so simple for secret agent Dae-hoon, whose plans for revenge take vigilantism to a whole new level: after his pregnant wife is butchered by psycho killer Kyung-chul (Min-sik Choi), Dae-hoon vows to make the murderer experience ten-thousand-fold the pain suffered by his missus. Taking a fortnight off work, he plays a deadly game of cat and mouse with Kyung-chul, catching the sicko and torturing him, but letting him go afterwards to repeat the process time and time again.Directed by Ji-woon Kim (A Tale of Two Sisters, A Bittersweet Life), I Saw The Devil is quite possibly the most ferocious revenge drama that I have seen. From the initial abduction of Dae-hoon's wife, which involves the poor woman being repeatedly smashed over the head with a hammer, to the shocking climax which sees the emotionally shattered secret agent finally putting a very bloody end to his brutal game, Ji-woon Kim's film is a relentless display of human savagery designed to spark its audience's most primal emotions, something which it succeeds in doing brilliantly.Min-sik Choi gives Anthony Wong (The Untold Story) and Ben Ng (Red To Kill) a run for their money as the ultimate Asian nutjob, abducting, hacking and slicing his way through a series of victims with relish, and his convincingly demented performance will have viewers right alongside Dae-hoon as he dishes out his special brand of justice, not just to Kyung-chul, but also to a cannibalistic couple who share his passion for killing.With his film's running time clocking in at well over two hours, director Kim can be accused of spinning things out for a little too long, but with oodles of no-holds-barred gore, and even some sleazy sex thrown in for good measure, there is no denying that this film packs a powerful punch that won't be forgotten in a hurry.", "I SAW THE DEVIL (English title) is a great story of revenge of a secret agent who pursues a serial killer, after this last one kill his fianc\u00e9e, in a deadly cat-mouse game.The story is captivating and the film has a good pace with a constant rhythm from the beginning to the end. Meanwhile we watch some great scenes of gore, with lots of blood but also very well shot. The humor is also present with some great jokes of black humor that are well connected to the plot. In fact is with little details this movie makes the difference, like some scenes where the camera work is great: the stabbing inside the cab is one of them. The actors also do a good job, especially the two who represent the main roles: the agent and the serial killer.A nice piece of Asian cinema for sure, very well directed and with a strong plot.", "This movie is not for everyone . If you have heart problems or you just simple hate blood ,Don't watch it . Usually , I don't watch this kind of movies .A Korean movie about an serial killer ?

I really enjoyed watching this movie .Yes ,it's violent .Yes ,it doesn't have a happy ending .If you still believe in fairy tales - don't watch it .This is a blowing-mind movie with two people who swings between madness and killer instinct .", "Many reviewers who give this movie a good rating assume that most critics are put off by the violence and the bloodshed and then proceed to support their appreciation for the movie by explaining that one needs to look through the (apparently necessary) gore and appreciate the deeper layers of the movie. Well, I wasn't necessarily put off by the gore, although I don't appreciate gore for the sake of gore (I don't like the Saw movies). I think Old Boy was an excellent movie for example. That movie went far beyond violence and gore and covered themes like pain, loss and revenge in a wildly original, meaningful way. 'I saw the devil' attempts to do something similar (at least, that is what I assume), but it fails miserably. The acting is actually quite good, Min-Sik Choi and Byung-Hun Lee are very capable actors, without any doubt. And the story starts off very promising. There's a good build up the first 45 minutes, but after that the story unravels into an inconsistent mess within no time. I deduct that the supposed moral of the story is that revenge cannot heal the inflicted pain, even if you try to live out your revenge in installments. And that in the end revenge backfires and the moral borderline between victim and perpetrator starts to dissolve. Fair enough, I've seen less illuminated morals in movies. But the execution of the idea undermines the whole purpose. A couple of examples: GPS-capsules are solid poop-proof and only flush out with diarrhea? And exactly at what level of mushiness does the capsule decide to go for the exit? These may seem like trivial questions, but are essential to the story development. And mind you, Kimchi tends to be pretty spicy. The first time the serial killer is set loose (temporarily) he happens to catch a ride with two killers (with a dead body in the trunk) - oh, what a coincidence. And of course he kills them, in a moving car. The secret agent discovers the 3 bodies, but somehow this does not convince him that his gamble to keep the serial killer on the loose may harm innocent bystanders (or are we supposed to believe that he knew they were killers and that justice was somehow done, despite the fact that he should know that the killer doesn't just have an appetite for 'guilty' victims as he butchered his fianc\u00e9e). Many more people end up dead or traumatized because of this gamble. And don't tell me that his hatred and urge for revenge have already completely taken over his rationality and morality at that point - why then proceed 1,5 hours to portray this disintegration? The other cops are supposedly completely incapable and do nothing to stop the carnage. Our cop gone rogue uses his cell phone a number of times to call with the police but they have no way to track him down? Despite the fact that they have GPS capsules with microphones in their arsenal they cannot track down a mobile phone? And even when they meet him at his father in law's house they don't apprehend him? Moreover, when the serial killer decides to surrender to the police, about 50 cops are waiting at the agreed meeting point. Then, our rogue cop comes driving by and while driving pulls the serial killer (waving a knife) into the car and abducts him. And the other cops just stand by, doing nothing. What? All 50 cops came on bicycle or using public transport and cannot pursue a driver who is struggling to subdue a serial killer with a knife while driving? And so on, and so onI'm willing to accept a (tiny) bit of illogicality, coincidence, inconsistency and even plain stupidity in a movie, but a movie should not be build on that. At least, that is my humble opinion. The rating this movie gets on IMDb shows that most viewers don't agree.", "I'll start off by saying that after everything I had read about the film, I was expecting it to actually be even more brutal. I mean, don't get me wrong, the violence here is absolutely relentless and easily some of the most intense I've ever seen, but I was expecting more. There was never a moment where I considered turning away from the screen (although, poop is gross), which I was expecting to have plenty of. It didn't have an impact on my appreciation of the whole piece though. Like I said, the violence was still relentless and some of the best I've seen from recent years. Relentless really is the perfect word for the whole thing; once it gets going about twenty minutes in, it just never stops. Neither character is allowed to pause and take a breath, it's just this nonstop battle that escalates and escalates. Every scene has an intensity that few directors are able to achieve. You know this battle will continue going, but you never know what's going to happen in each scene and that's rare.There's so much violence right off the bat that it enters into this realm where anything is possible and thus every scene keeps you on the edge of your seat. The violence is probably the most positive aspect of the film, but it also contains that theme of \"when does one stop being the avenger and becomes just another monster hunting a monster?\" which is one of my favorite themes in any medium. There's something so compelling about that to me, this exploration of right and wrong and when does the just cross the line and become just another animal. Monsters turning righteous men into monsters. It's a theme that will never get old to me and this film captures that all expertly. Of course it really helps that both Byung-hun Lee and Min-sik Choi deliver sensational performances, the former being the perfect choice for the man decaying into darkness (his breakdown at the end was devastating) and the latter just being the most disgusting, detestable, terrifying monster imaginable.Throughout the film I really felt that there should have been more of an emotional strength to it, a resonance that comes with losing a loved one, but our main character boils all of that inside and when he finally lets it all out, that emotional strength comes pouring out in one riveting moment. That final scene between the two of them, where Kim Soo-hyeon realizes that no matter what he does, he can't take that boulder he spoke of off his chest and put it onto Kyung-chul's, delivers more of a punch than any scene of violence could have achieved. My one and only complaint is that the film goes on a little too long, but even that hardly makes a dent in a final product that is so compelling. I've always had a bit of a stigma against Asian cinema because, for whatever reason, it's never been able to really engage me, but this one had me hooked from about five minutes in.", "I Saw The Devil is, in my opinion, not for female eyes - it is gruesome and depicts women as easy prey for the unhinged of male society.Mens inner demons run riot in this movie, for one man he is intrinsically evil, for another, his actions are brought about by rage and revenge.The acting of the two main characters is close to perfection, the story-line chilling, with the final scene, the yin to the movie's yang. As a film watcher for forty years this movie creeps into the very small list of ten-out-of-tens. Masterpiece.Les D", "SPOILER Storyline has no sense at all, nothing in this movie is related to real life situations. Cops in the movie are completely useless, always late and totally uninvolved in happenings. There is no emergency team on crime scene to help the dying victim but bunch of people and cop \"puppets\". Main story is glorifying the main character, putting storyline aside and making this movie not about killer's victims but about \"super hero secret agent\" main character. Who is, by the way, stupendously naive. Except it's very bloody and violent, storyline and movie by itself doesn't have any cinematographic value. On top of everything, this movie is more than 2 hours long.This movie will make you tired and exhausted, leaving you crying from being bored at the end together with the main character. SPOILER END", "I challenge you how many times do you have to cover your eyes with your hand during thiz film? The movie is so fertile, it makes \"The Last House on the Left\" (2009) and \"I Spit on Your Grave\" (2010) look like plastic trees. The violence level will shock you to the edge of your seat. A secret agent found his fianc\u00e9e brutally murdered by the hand of a psychopath serial killer. With all the power he has, the agent hunts down the killer and avenge him through the mercilessly pains he could possibly do. The power of thiz movie doesn't come from its story which is predictable but still it leaves you a little twist in the ending, but how the Director describes it so well and brilliantly gritty. The fact is Korea Media Rating Board had forced the Director (Jee-Woon Kim) to cut and edit the violent contents in thiz film. Although after the re-editing, in some scenes it still will mark something in your mind, especially the killing scenes and violence against women. It's not a recommended film for viewers with weak heart. Kim is known for his previous works such as \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" (2003) and \"The Good, The Bad, The Weird\" (2008). In thiz revenge thriller, the image is colorful with precise lighting and stunning cinematography. The throbbing Score works along harmoniously through every scene. However, the focus of thiz movie undoubtedly is on two main characters. Both bring a depth of emotion in their character developments. As NIS agent, Byung-Hun Lee (who is previously known as Storm Shadow in \"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\" {2009}) gives a resolute and complex character, on one side he performs the vengeance without platitude, and on the other side we could still see his brittle emotion. As the killer, Min-Sik Choi (who is previously known for \"Oldboy\" in 2003) provides a convincing crazy psychopath character that is not afraid of anything. It's a perfect role for Choi. Nothing will prepare you for some atrocious scenes. In the end, after seeing thiz film entirely, something will make you realize who the real devil is, is it the killer? Or is it the man who takes revenge on him? Since both of them bring unmerciful heat to their actions. Although they come from different direction and motive, finally they meet in the middle anyway, they are the same. It's a good contemplation. Every person has the devil inside them. The difference is how far we can tame it? Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com", "I usually don't write reviews on movies, but I felt compelled to write a thing or two about this movie that I disliked immensely. I honestly am having very hard time trying to understand why this movie got such a high rating in IMDb. First off, The story was very boring and predictable, and protagonist was probably one of the most despicable character I've seen in a revenge flick. It can probably be argued that he has probably done more damage than the serial killer through all the suffering he caused for innocent people. He appeared to show zero remorse for all the trauma he caused innocent victims by letting the killer go every time and seemed to enjoy the suffering he caused around him. At least for me, he had zero redeeming quality and made me want to root for the psycho killer (which I assume was not the director's intention). Further, Lee byung hun's lack of emotional range can be clearly seen in many crucial scenes as his acting definitely feels forced from the beginning to the end, and there is absolutely no character development for both the protagonist and the killer which I found very disappointing. They were simply one dimensional characters most frequently seen in Hollywood movies. Lee byung hun's dialogue seemed forced at times, and I could not feel a single genuine emotion coming from him in any of the scene. Not only that, the plot of this movie simply baffled me. Kim Soo Hyeon(Lee byung hun's character) makes many (and I mean many) illogical decisions in the movie. After he let Kyung-chul go for the last time, why would he go to the hospital to ask his brother(?) what Kyung-chul is up to. I would have to assume that he has to be intellectually compromised to not see where this is headed. Kyung-chul pretty much gives it away by saying that he will get his revenge, which have to mean that he is probably headed for someone close to him. Further, why would his brother know where Kyung-chul is headed, and how on earth did he wake up from a brain trauma with few slaps in the face. Further, why on earth would he provoke someone who nearly killed him? None of these actions made sense. I'm assuming that his brother was there for some kind of comic relief , but this was neither amusing nor relevant to the plot. He could have probably stopped Kyung-chul from killing his father in law, if he used his brain for just one second. Further, I'm confused as to how Kim soo hyeon would put his hand in someone's mouth and rip one's mouth open, without getting seriously bit. Even Kyung-chul's action doesn't make much sense as it would be more logical for him to go for Kim soo hyeon's parents instead of his father in law. Next, how did he retrieve the GPS device after Kyung-chul made a random civilian swallow it in the bathroom(he used the device at the end of the movie so he can hear his family suffer which I find very unnecessary and over-the-top). Am I to believe that Kim soo hyeon actually retrieved it somehow from a civilian's mouth when he was in a hurry to find Kyung- chul (just so he can use it at the end for dramatic effect?) Also, I hated the part when Kyung-chul's wife was getting killed. I feel terrible for saying this, but making a female victim pregnant is such a hackneyed and clich\u00e9d way to make the viewer feel emotional connection with the victim that I honestly found myself laughing through this part. Fight scenes were also pretty corny and no where near as gritty as many top Korean thrillers I've seen (old boy, chaser...). It was just some pretty-boy doing his very best not to dirty his leather jacket for the most part (again reminiscent of many Hollywood films). Kim soo hyeon honestly seemed to try so hard to preserve his \"cool\" image that it definitely overshadowed any kind of emotion coming from him. I could go on and on, but I think I'll just stop here. Aside from few beautiful scenes (especially the beginning sequence when soo hyeon's wife gets dragged away in the snow), this movie was weak in its plots, dialogues, and character developments and had so many flaws. I do not believe this movie deserves the 7.9 rating it has, and, in my honest opinion, this is probably on par with \"I spit on your grave.\" Also I am not a troll trying to provoke people. I genuinely want to know what most people here sees in this movie.", "How far can the revenge thriller genre go? Well when you have a film of this genre helmed by twisted Korean director Jee-woon Kim it can go pretty far. I Saw the Devil is about a secret agent who blurs the line between good and evil as he hunts down his fianc\u00e9e's killer to enact some particularly gruesome revenge. His lust for revenge sends him to the brink of insanity as he begins to become a more despicable human being than the serial killer he is chasing down. The film is brutal, intense, and haunting. It is unapologetically graphic from start to finish and is absolutely not for the faint of heart. But, for anyone who can stomach its brutality, I Saw the Devil is quite the movie.It seems this film's primary goal is to shock and disgust. It more than excels in this area, but it also works very well as a psychological thriller. There is this constant struggle of what is good and what is evil throughout the film. The distinction grows more and more faint as Kim Soo-hyeon grows more and more obsessed with catching and defeating Kyung-chul, the serial killer. He is disturbingly brutal and endlessly vicious in his revenge against Kyung-chul. The film has a somewhat repetitive nature once it gets going. Kyung-chul hides somewhere, is about to torture a victim, but then Soo-hyeon stops him and beats the hell out of him before leaving him in misery and pain so that he may track him down and torture him once again. But the repetitiveness works because it is a constant escalation in brutality and a loss of humanity. Plus every fight between Soo-hyeon and Kyung-chul is incredible.Jee-woon Kim shoots this film with a brutally precise eye for visual integrity. His camera-work allows the film to succeed as a haunting drama as well as a fast paced action thriller. The fights are choreographed excellently and the violence in each duel only increases. This isn't a film for the squeamish as Kim finds every possible way to disgust his audience with the bloodiest and most malicious forms of torture possible. It is all shot so intensely that you just want to scream in pain and disgust at the horrors you are witnessing. And yet at the same time there are calmer and more subtle scenes of the film which are shot with haunting beauty in the framing and camera movement. Plus the film has a disturbingly beautiful score that will leave you mystified as well as terrified. I wouldn't go as far as to call this an art house film but it certainly has some qualities that might lead it to that.I Saw the Devil is a fantastic film in all of its bloody glory. It is the kind of film that will only appeal to those with an appetite for maliciousness and a stomach for horrific amounts of blood and gore. This film is so disturbed and yet so excellent in its execution that if you can handle it you will be treated to a very worthwhile film. Expect the unexpected with this film and be prepared to look away in horrified disgust.", "This Korean movie is the bloodiest movie I have ever seen, but that does not mean that its a bad movie. Its not the horror movie but its more red than Hellraiser I,II, and III! I watch it with my wife and wee were fist shock with amount of violence and gore in this film, but both agree that film is truly good, but not for everyone! Min Sik Choi is excellent in role of psychopathic killer. This one and the role in Old Boy is his best performance in life! Film is very good directed, The cast is very good, and the story line too. This film is like part four of Chan Wok Park vengeance trilogy. Everyone who likes Korean thriller movies, this one must see! 9/10.", "Director Jee-Woon Kim has had a spotty career to date. His breakout, A Tale Of Two Sisters, was a muted, cruel and often confusing tale. It was a case of style over substance, a film that was to ignite the messages boards rather than the average film goers brain. His follow up however, A Bittersweet Life, was thrilling yarn, taking its ques from the coveted American styled thriller. The film concerns an 'enforcer' who is told to do the one job he wont do, obviously this doesn't make his boss very happy. Like i said we've seen this before but these thrillers set up their premise early and the fun is had watching our main character stumble over the finishing line. With 'I Saw The Devil' there is no such care taken, it sees the director plunge head first into the murky and depraved world of torture porn.As an audience we should be asking ourselves what the point of given scene or character action is but the violence here is gratuitous and without merit. Even something as shallow as Saw (Darren Lynn Boussman) which arguably ushered in this new fad to the masses, has a (slightly) veiled point, that some people deserve to die because they don't know how to live. In one scene in I Saw The Devil, our 'hero' is told that 'revenge is for the American movies' it would seem then the notion has been processed for all its hyper real absurdity but still the film makers are intent to make us watch the senseless breaking of limbs and bludgeoning. Just while we are on the point of the bludgeoning (of which there are many), why are these characters still alive after 30 blows to the head with a metal pipe? The answer seems to be so we can have a nice little coincidental expository scene or indeed so the person can be tortured further for our (dis)pleasure.Firstly, the idea of redemption through revenge is one that doesn't sit with me at all. That's not to say i cant have fun watching it, films like Black Rain (Ridley Scott) set up the ensuing redemptive violence with care making the idea of Michael Douglas's impending bloody revenge more appealing. Or take Oldboy for example, with Oldboy, the fun of the revenge is in the complexity of the web spun in its honour. We get nothing here except for the death of his wife (who just happens to be pregnant) and this is surely enough right? Well, no its not. I need to care about the characters first, so i therefore feel for them, if anything further happens to them whether it be directly or indirectly. But that's what the film deals in, actions. Our hero never verbalises his anger, he just acts this leads to a disconnect from him. This fact coupled with the over use of the films killer (Min-Sik Choi) gives the film an uneasy weight toward the dealings of the killer, the film revels in his depravity. Its almost like watching one of the vacuous major horror franchises in which the killer is the main star and the audience come to watch him work. By the end of the movie, i didn't care whether the killer was punished or not, rightly or wrongly. There was nothing holding the movie together, people cried but there is no emotion, this movie is completely soulless. A good juxtaposition to this is The Chaser. The Chaser walks similar lines, we have a depraved serial killer and the man who stop at nothing to exact bloody revenge. The difference here being that the incentive for the hero is not just to kill or maim the bad guy, which is completely uninteresting, our hero learns that there are more important things in the world other than his nihilism. Neither men here have anything real to live for, they are both as bad as each other. Watching as Byung-Hun Lee bludgeons suspected serial killers is not fun, its just wrong.If you want morally murky then Joe Carnahan' s excellent Narc is a fantastic example of good person doing terrible things, under extreme circumstances. In that film, Ray Liotta goes to illegal lengths to gain a conviction and tough justice on the criminal underworld after his partner dies. We really get a sense of character in the film, and you really get a feel for Liotta's choices, however wrong they might be. So what we end up watching isn't nasty or irrelevant, its heartbreaking.I honestly couldn't help but be appalled by this movie. I didn't want to be, i don't want to be the killjoy. i saw nothing in this movie that justified its 2hrs 20minute runtime and I'm a person that likes to try and take positives out of negatives. I think that the vast majority that will see this movie will be looking for the torture porn elements or just because they heard how 'bad' it is and for that, they will enjoy it. Those who, like me, were looking for something with abit more meat (forgive the pun), something a little more in the vein of A Bittersweet Life, Oldboy or The Chaser, i would strongly recommend staying away from this tripe.", "Revenge.. is an easy theme for one to work with and to weave a thrilling story around and Jee-woon Kim makes a confusing contribution with this film - even the name in English makes no sense if u look back! And look back I do with a lot of disappointment at having been led on by the high rating on IMDb! What is wrong with the film-viewing community these days that they give high ratings to any pretentious junk that comes their way?This film is not the least bit realistic in any way in terms of the situations and the incidents.. it is just too surreal while it attempts to be anything but that! Like just how does the good guy with the pin- up-guy face and boy-band-crew haircut get away so easily from the cops AND the bad guys! And going by the ease with which the 'bad guy' does away with humans, one would think that living in Korea is really dangerous - and young girls dressed in expensive-looking clothes wouldn't wanna be caught dead waiting for a bus in the middle of nowhere - especially after dark! Its like the script-writer sat with a bunch of his drunk friends discussing women and they went, \"..yeah, let's put this girl here in this scene, strip her naked, and then another girl here, get her molested, and another one there and get her raped! Yeah, that's the secret to attracting a large audience!\" So at regular intervals - what could have been hinted at, was explicitly displayed, in not anywhere near artistic shots. Purely gross stuff shown to gross u out.. without any emotion involved at all!Very lackluster performances too.. bah! None of the actors in this film seem really fit for their role and instead look very uncomfortable playing their part and eager to finish the job and move on! So i'll not waste any more of my (nor your) time with this film and would like to make this review brief, in concluding that besides the casting and the plot, there were just too many flaws in this film in dealing with psychology, physiology, etc. Cheap thrills in shock- sequences and an overly-cold cold-blooded 'bad guy' who is thrown into pointless gory scenes make this film a senseless ordeal!3 out of 10 for the not-so-terrible music and the bare effort taken by Kim to make this film a 'thriller' with OK cinematography (A tale of 2 sisters - also by Kim - had better visuals). This film is easily avoidable!!", "I am a huge fan of horror/thriller films, but I couldn't quite get my head around this one... Admittedly, I don't watch many foreign horror films.

I get the whole 'catch and release' idea, but it almost went too far. I found myself feeling somewhere between almost bored and not entertained most of the time.

After a failed romance at work Dal-ja counters with a paid boyfriend (6 years younger than herself) to save face and finds herself drawn to him. She meets a rich man, separated from his wife, and is drawn to him too. Dal-ja's Spring had fun while dealing with women over 30 (who are considered old), women dating younger men, women dating men with the \"right\" career path, women balancing work and family, jealous spouses, former loves becoming friends, etc. This show was enjoyable, touching, intelligent and understated. Dal-ja's Spring wasn't overly dramatic and felt realistic. I was satisfied with where all the characters ended up at the end of the 22 episode series.What I liked about Dal-ja's Spring: 1. Dal-ja was played with pluck and good cheer by actress Chae Rim. Dal- ja's permed hair, her laugh, her toughness, her tenderness, her love for her friends and family, made her interesting and likable. I enjoyed the 22 episode evolution Dal-ja made. 2. Tae-bong the paid boyfriend was sensitive yet guarded and intriguing as portrayed by actor Lee Min-ki. His story was an interesting onion that was peeled during the series. 3. Dal-ja's co-workers were fun and supportive, the kinds of folks you'd want to work with. Even the terror boss turns out to respect and admire Dal-ja. 4. Dal-ja's mother and grandmother loved her and wanted her happiness. To them that equaled marriage to a man with the \"right\" career which wasn't necessarily the option for Dal-ja. 5. Secondary couple was interesting too. Seon-joo an independent 33 year old home shopping hostess and Se-do a 33 year old home shopping producer (Dal-ja's failed work romance) had their own obstacles to overcome in their relationship. They evolved into good friends with Dal-ja and important supporters.What I didn't like about Dal-ja's Spring: 1. Tae-bong's mother was quite irritating initially. Fly off the handle anger, not accepting of Dal-ja's relationship with Tae-bong, she was tough to swallow in the early episodes. Eventually she comes to value Dal-ja. 2. Soo-jin Tae-bong's ex-girlfriend was so sure she'd get him back. I felt this character was clich\u00e9 and expendable."], "1258": [], "1259": [], "1260": [], "1261": ["A true heartfelt comedy. We see a connection between a mentally ill father and his lovingly adorable daughter. A really close one. Although mentally unfit, the emotion and love of the father is undeniable. And then you have a smart and understanding daughter, who loves his father so much and doesn't see her father differently. Behind that, there is a tragically engaging story -- The kind-hearted father, as innocent as he is, accused of murder and rape. The prison scenes act as an icing to the story. A place so feared and somber, is in fact where most of the comedy takes place. It shows the positive side of a prison life, and that not all prisoners are gangsters or bad. Everyone has a heart, a good one that is. They have made their prison cell a very bearable place. So much that even Ye-Seung, the daughter can hide in it and stay with them.All characters play very important roles to construct the whole movie. It's fun to watch the prison inmates, all having their very own personality. Ryoo Seung-Yong portrayed the character of the mentally handicapped father very convincingly. And the child actor, Kal So-Won is so cute and sweet and suited her role so much. Even the adult version of the girl turns out to be a real sweetheart and has a very captivating performance. The movie shows us that you can be someone as high up as a Police Commissioner, but a disgusting personality. Or someone as simple-minded as the father in this story, but with a good heart. Rankings and positions really does not determine a person. Sometimes things are more delightful when it's not complicated, as long as we know to appreciate and cherish all that we have.This is definitely one of the best Korean movies. Filled with tears and laughters. Yes, you have to prepare some tissues as it gets very teary- eyed towards the end.. and not just once. A fun to watch film from beginning to the end and a compelling drama at the same time, easily grips the hearts of the audience. Very well thought of and extremely well executed. A true gem.", "And I am sure most of you will too. The story revolves around the strong family bond between mentally disabled father Yong-gu and his young daughter Ye-sung. Movie begins with a young woman collecting witnesses and later standing in court to reverse a ruling of a case many years ago. In court she starts telling her story and thats when the real part of the movie begins. A mentally disabled man is torn apart from his little daughter as he is wrongfully accused of a unspeakable crime. He is mistreated by police and prison authorities. In jail he is bullied. But slowly he changes the mind of people around him and hatred turns into care. His daughter is smuggled into the prison and it is there father and daughter can meet again. Comic and enjoyable moments take place within the prison walls. The scenes alternate between being very serious and being comic. Both part is very well done. Its is pulled off by excellent acting. Ye-sung is adorable and acting is outstanding for her age. Yong-gu is the child like father whose only concern is welbeing of Ye-sung.The movie is not flawless. If you really want to, you really can find some of the events and story illogical or impractical. For example how can he be allowed to be the guardian of this daughter in the 1st place? Surely he is not mature enough to raise a child but it seems neighbors, welfare or school must not be ignorant about it.I found similarity with the movies Life is Beautiful and Green Mile. Life is Beautiful was a story about a child like father and his son and was a comedy set on a very depressing world. In Green Mile the prisoner has a child like innocence and wins the trust of all the guards. Usually I don't think it is good idea to mix up very polarized genres. Particularly I don't think its a good idea to mix up something very depressing and dark with comedy. Comedy best works standalone or when mixed with Action or Romance. Hence the genres rom-com or action-comedy. I think when you are watching something depressing and when you are presented with a comic moment its not natural to immediately switch to a laughter mode, and the scene is wasted, and hence its not a great idea to do it in the 1st place. But Miracle on Cell No 7 pulls this off wonderfully with its brilliant cast. But it also made me think if this were only father daughter comedy movie only how fun would that be.Final verdict: I give it a 10/10. Previously shawshank redemption was my favourite 'prison' themed movie. Now its Miracle on Cell No 7. And to those who has already seen the movie.... yes there was one scene which broke me down completely... there are very few movies I have seen that have moved me this much.", "I have to say that I am not a Korean Movie fan. Or else you might say I kinda avoid watching Korean Drama because I personally think that it is way too dramatic. But a friend recommended this movie and I thought \"What do I have to loose if I just watch it sometimes?\" so I watched it and Oh My God, if you are into sad movie this is a must watch. Even thou if you don't like Korean Movie, still, this one is worth to watch and I am guarantee it myself that this movie will drain your tears (exceptional for those with no heart).This movie will melt your heart by showing the innocence of a little girl and a gently loving father. It'll show you how great the power of love is through the tears and also the laughter of joys this movie will bring. I personally recommend it to accompany your free time. so yes, I'm giving 10/10.", "Miracle in cell no.7, one of the highest grossing movie in Korea, is one of the best family drama I have seen in ages. The mentally ill father and the intelligent daughter reminded me of I am Sam, but I liked Seung-yong Ryoo's acting than Sean Penn's. The movie's plot and story are great and the story inside the prison also grabbed my attention and I loved the way the comedy has been blended with the emotions in the movie. I laughed my a** off for a moment, the other moment tears rolled out of my eyes.The movie's end is a great tearjerker and will force one to cry. I don't just recommend one to have tissues to wipe their tears but also a friend to have a shoulder to cry on.

Miracle in Cell No. 7 is a heartwarming tale that depicts the relationship between a 6-year old girl & her mentally challenged father who's accused & convicted for a crime he didn't commit. Awaiting the trial, he is assigned Cell no. 7 which consists of the most hardened criminals & unknowingly convinces everyone that he's a good-hearted fellow who couldn't have committed the crime he's accused of. And so, the inmates get together to help him see his daughter again by breaking her in & also start preparing him for his trial.There is a heavy amount of non-sense & annoyance in the film but there is also a lot of heart that went into its making. Some scenes, no matter how silly or childish, still are able to resonate a feeling of love & the characters look eccentric yet adorable thanks to mesmerizing performances from its cast. The film also carries a huge emotional baggage that is sugar-coated with layers after layers of superbly timed humour but is sure to leave many viewers with tears during its heartbreaking final moments.On an overall scale, Miracle in Cell No. 7 completely surprised me with its heartfelt narration, plethora of childlike but never childish moments, expert use of slapstick humour, vibrant characters & a heart-winning performances from its cast. It may not be great enough to rank amongst the best films of its genre but its soul is certainly at the right place plus it makes up for an immensely satisfying family drama that will leave most of its viewers with a smile on their face & tears in their eyes. Give it a try.", "It's contrived, preposterous, emotionally manipulative and sappy but such a crowd pleaser. My specs fogged up a few times because of my hot tears. Even though it was dripping with schmaltz, I still found myself easily lulled into the story. It's a prison story, a family drama, a redemptive drama, an investigative thriller and a court drama, all rolled into one. The strength with the film lies in its excellent ensemble cast of veteran Korean actors and the little girl - a total natural. I love her character's name, Yesung. Pronounce the name a few times in your head... sounds like Jesus?\u00a0 Love the scenes in the cell... It's quite ridiculous but the earnest performances are so good, you will easily overlook the preposterous setups and some of the situations are ingeniously funny. This film was released in Korea early this Jan and has now become the third highest grossing domestic movie of all time, behind The Host (2006) and The Thieves (2012).So far this year, this is the only film that made me laugh and cry. An excellent film. The perfect film to bring your other half, especially if she's into Korean weepies. Don't be afraid to show up your new age sensitive self dudes", "How are movies rated? By way of cinematography? By how the characters act? By how wonderful the CGI are? By how real the movie is? Or by how much the producer spent in the movie?I do not really care for all of the above.. For me, I rate a movie 10 if I felt the desire to watch it again after a week. If I selflessly share it with others or brag about how good it was or feel proud when I hear somebody else praise it..Those are my parameters.I wouldn't have mind if you didn't care how a rated this movie or how I reviewed it if I only wanted it for myself. But I really wanted others to watch it. Watch it especially with their daughter if they have one. I promise you, this movie will make you laugh so hard but in the end it will make you cry so much..One thing good about movies is, they can make make you laugh and you'll love them, they can make you cry but you'll still love them nonetheless:-) This movie is all about that.I advise you .. DON'T JUST WATCH IT!.. WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN...", "It is a hard nut to crack to make the audience shed tears while watching a movie. But for that matter it is much difficult to make the audience cry and laugh simultaneously, but \"Miracle in Cell No.7\" is one of the highest-grossing Korean films and it can! Lee Yong-gu (Ryu Seung-Ryong),a mentally retarded man, working as a staff parking in a shopping center lives with Ye-sung (Kal So-won), aged 6 years. Yong-gu situation never hinder their happiness as a father and daughter. They come to an unexpected event which brings Yong-gu as deceitfully accused of murder and sexual assault of high rank police officer's daughter in their district. Yong-gu is in the prison while awaiting for verdict and it a death penalty, leaving Ye-sung by herself and had to drop out of school to an orphanage. In cell number 7 Yong-gu has five other inmates, Choi Choon-ho (Park Won-sang), Shin Bong-sik (Jeong Man-sik), Man-bum (Kim Jung-tae), Oldman Seo (Kim Gi-Cheon) and so called cell leader So Yang-ho (Oh Dai-su) who was saved by Yong-gu from an attack, after a long time all realize that there was an incorrect judgment against him. They smuggle Ye-sung to the cell to be able to meet with her father, it subsequently changes the sentiment of Warden Jang Min-hwan (Jung Jin-young) in a sympathetic way, and they began to plan an idea to save Yong-gu, if necessary, all will escape from prison.Nothing changes for a 6 year old even if his father is mentally retarded and both have the intellect of same age. What really matters is love. The unconditional love between a mentally challenged father and his daughter has been portrayed immaculately.Ryu Seung-Ryong gives a poignant performance as it takes a lot to be consistent in such a challenging role, his body language perfectly describes a mentally challenged man.Kal So-Won is very pretty and she steals your heart with her innocent and adorable screen presence.The ensemble does the job effortlessly like an icing on the cake.Recommended.8/10", "i must say this movie is the best movie i ever seen, thanks god i didn't miss it the acting was superb you almost believe that the main actor is a fool in a real life , this movie will make you happy and sad and you will enjoy them both you will enjoy every moment in this movie even the sad moments ! i wont go in details to avoid spoilers but you will not feel it till you watch it, i recommend watching this movie with your kids , it will teach them a lesson about the father love .i'm now a really big fan of Korean movies especially after watching this one sadly most of Hollywood movies now focus on making money more then the content of the movie itself please Korean director keep Korean movies your way!.", "Rarely will you see a movie that shakes your soul to the core and this movie manages to do that. For a long time I remained adamant that I will never experience another movie as lachrymose as The Green Mile but I was wrong. My tears just would not stop. The father daughter relationship in this movie is simply beautiful, in some ways ineffable. You have got to watch this movie in order to understand how pure, innocent and affectionate their bond is. Their acting was incredible. The child in particularly was extremely convincing and deserves praise for expressing believable emotions at such a young age. Some might criticise the movie for a few illogical/unrealistic events but I can assure you that this does not diminish the greatness of this movie. What matters in this movie is character development and character interaction which are executed flawlessly. The supporting cast also do an excellent job. Hope, justice, mercy, innocence, sacrifice and affection are some of the themes that are explored in this harrowing and satisfying movie. This movie is right up there with The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile for great prison movies. Please...please do not miss this one.", "For all of you saying that this story wasn't realistic, you're pitting the legal system of Korea against the legal system of America/England/Australia/Canada where you're used to it being (somewhat) fair for inmates. If it weren't for the documentary I saw on Youtube about how f**ked up the court systems and jail facilities are in almost all of Asia I wouldn't have believed that these prisoners could get away with everything they got away with, and that this case could have been blamed on Yong-Go even though it was obvious he didn't do it. In Asia it is all, entirely, COMPLETELY about saving face and keeping a good reputation. Even if the Chief of Police knew he didn't do it, Yong- Go still would have been executed just for the simple fact that everyone believed that he was a murderer and no-one would want the misfortune of being labeled a liar. It would just be easier to keep everything under hush and continue on with the lie. Obviously the kid wouldn't have happened, but who'd believe that anyway? Also the inmates would be under 100% more supervision and the guards would be 1,000,000% more corrupt. That's why the court system in Japan/Korea/China isn't spoken about much, even to the people who live there. Jail is a big NO-NO and your life is guaranteed ruined if you're ever sent. The very best and most desired lawyer in Asia would be laughed at and swept aside in America/England/Australia/Canada. So yeah, to me it was more realistic than most people because I know the court system there isn't half as structured, or public, as it is in the western world.", "I love watching movies, and this is the first movie that made me cry a LOT (even experienced hyperventilation during some of the really heavy scenes). South Korea is know for their artistic and heavy film making, whatever the genre is, and this film is no exception. Story line is simple; even a child can understand what's going on. We see a goofy and loving father and his Adorable daughter; Rich couple and their innocent daughter taken suddenly by an accident; High official taken by grief due to the loss of a beloved; and a lot of inmates who all have their own special characters to the story. It's the remarkable love between a father and daughter that makes it so simple yet brilliant. First class acting, superb casting, a little bit of comedy. Some scenes are a little too much of a clich\u00e9, but who cares? The film totally delivered!", "This is perfect for the upcoming Father's Day. The story is about the love of the daughter to her mentally challenged father. This is what we call the unconditional love. The movie will let you laugh, cry and realize the reality in our society. Imprisonment and sentencing death to innocent man is very common especially those who are poor and who cannot afford are the main victims of these. Heart melting and tear dropping movie. Two thumbs up for the good actors (especially to Mr.Ryu Seung-Ryong and Ms. Kal So-won, producers and the director.", "Ryu Seung-Ryong is one of the hot actors in Korea. His recent movies, the ultimate weapon, \"bow\", \"GwangHae\" and many others show why he is a good actor. Actually he is probably the one of the two hottest actors in Korea nowadays. One is Ha Jung-Woo and the other is Ryu Seung-Ryong.His characters in movies were usually very manly. Sometimes a boss of a gangster, sometimes a warrior, sometimes a very solemn guy... well.. sometimes a playboy ( in \"All about my wife\" ) So, it was a joy to see his the other side in this movie. This story is not based on true story. However, it shows some problems in the process of police's accusation of a person and persuade him to accept police's offer by falsely presents some of their ideas and sacrifice the innocent people's life without any payback.Right after this movie, an news article was posted in a newspaper how many percentage of all those people who are sentenced to something non-trivial things are falsely persuaded to accept police's offer or things like that.So, although this movie is totally fiction and comedy, it gives us some chance to think about the problem after laughing and sobbing.One thing I noticed is that probably this movie is re-adaptation of Hollywood movie, \"Green Mile\". The difference is that it was about a person who had a super power in Green Mile and he tried to save a girl's life, but he was falsely accused as a killer. In this movie, Ryu Seung-Ryong is a mentally handicapped person who loves his daughter very much. He promised to buy a school bag with the \"Sailer Moon\" cartoon on it for his daughter. When he got his \"probably\" daily salary from a local market, a girl approached to him and she told him that she knew a store where they sell more sailor moon school bag. Because it was a cold day, the little girl slipped on ice and due to the too-heavy sailor moon bag she wore, she slipped heavily and to make thins worse, a cement brick which was pushing down some covers for goods at some stores fell on her forehead. So, he tried to do CPR ( because he learned it at his work ) but an woman passing by saw him and misunderstood he tried to rape her and killed her.Then there is a chief in the prison who started to see his real intention and what he actually did. He tried his best to save him, but he couldn't prevent his hanging from being processed.So, overall plot of those two movies are almost same. In the case of Green Mile, why the guy was falsely accused is based on the situation here in the US, while the mentally handicapped guy was accused so was based on the situation there in S.Korea.I don't know if Korean producers of this movie actually intended or bought the scenario from Hollywood. But the plot is like that.Sometimes it's very interesting to see how different directors and cultures draw the same topic differently. Even though I thought it was re-adaptation of Green Mile, it was not boring to watch this movie. It felt fresh. Also I had interesting time to compare those two movies.I recommend this movie.", "This film will make you laugh. This film will make you cry.

He's surnamed \"wolf dog\", because he had to fight wolves when he was still young and was treated badly as a hostage. Now he likes to foster his image as a fearsome beast. There's a fight for the throne going on. Hae Soo finds herself caught between it all. Thanks to her history lessons at school she comes to realize Wang So will win this battle finally. He'll become the future king of Goryeo, and a bloody tyrant at that. Soo loves So, but she also fears him. Can she change her lover into a better ruler in time? The Good: The first meeting of the 'Moon Lovers', Hae Soo and Wang So, sets the tone for the whole series: old fashioned romance but a love that hurts. There's the black Wolf Prince riding his war horse, first endangering Hae Soo but saving her as well by lifting her in the saddle in front of him. Then there's the extended closeup of their faces, sitting opposite each other, bouncing up and down, having their eyes on each other while the music plays their love theme. The next scene he seems afraid of his own feelings and So drops Soo to the ground. Their love is painful, literally.Leading man Lee Joon Gi is simply the best actor available for that kind of TV making. The minute he appears on the screen I am glued to his face and facial expressions despite his mask, that renders all kinds of emotions like joy, pain, embarrassment, hate. Notwithstanding his well performed fighting scenes, he's in danger of becoming a modern Rudolph Valentino, with female fans only. I hope he'll get the chance to proof himself in less romantic roles playing more tormented characters like the lead in Man on High Heels (2014)for example.The Bad: Moon Lovers is a remake of the Chinese series 'Scarlet Heart' with 35 episodes. The original version could handle all the princes and their love interests. The Korean production however should have cut some story lines to flesh out the characters of Soo and So, who are the protagonists, giving them more time to develop their romance. Now we were misled thinking Wang Wook was Soo's Prince Charming. Kang Ha Neul gives a stunning performance, so it was no punishment to watch him stealing screen time from Lee Joon Gi. But the story lines became too difficult to tell, leaving plot holes until the very end. Also there are still questions unanswered: is this all about(moon)love? Or altering history? Who knows?Nevertheless I would highly recommend this series. I was hooked for 20 episodes, hoping for a sequel.", "I am no fan of Korean TV series but I took an exception in watching since the plot was very complicated taking a step back in time. It took me awhile to feel comfortable watching since it took a lot of effort in reading subtitles while internalizing the dialogue. But right after Episode 2, I was totally hooked. I couldn't stop with just 1 episode a night and had the craving to just watch all 20 episodes in 2 nights!! Scarlet Heart Ryeo has just begun airing in the Philippines but I have access to the original version with English subtitle, which I prefer. It was giving me a headache listening to the Tagalog translation. Besides, it was more heart-wrenching hearing their original voices. So, as a fan of the Scarlet Heart Ryeo series, I hope that a Scarlet Heart Ryeo 2 is up for an international showing SOON. It may not have been a hit in South Korea but I hope that the producers seek the comments from the international audience for an unbiased feedback.", "Moon Lovers was my first Korean Drama, and i got addicted! It is simply SUPERB!!! The actors have a great chemistry together,and i will like to find out other movies or settings they had made before Moon Lovers! The landscapes and locations are fantastic,the battle scenes were like watching a well made action movie with great battle choreography. I was surprised from the costumes and fashion of the era that were Amazing,and most of all the plot is breathtaking! I can't hide that I cried many times over the 20 episodes i saw in just 5 days time! I recommend it to everyone,and i hope that there will be a second season!!! Please!", "Lee Joon Gi delivered his role of unwanted, abused, desperate-for- love Prince very well, and IU was very natural in her expressions. Their friendship and romance were slow in developing, but blossomed beautifully when they did, leaving viewers aching for more.They say a story is only as good its villain. Scarlet Heart has no shortage of villains, all the actors and actresses playing their roles magnificently 'til the end.Warning: This drama is not for the weak-minded and fainthearted.Overall: Good acting, good story, good soundtrack, good chemistry between the leads, good fight sequences, good cinematography, based on historical events (but filmed with liberty).I was hooked from start to finish, left with just one wish... that the director and staff have mercy and finally grace us with those precious deleted scenes!", "I loved this drama. The story and acting was amazing. I think all the main actors have done an amazing job. Ending is extremely sad, though. I would love to know that beforehand. I was really hoping for a happy ending, but towards the end the story was just getting worse and worse. This must be the saddest drama I've ever seen. There are some really sad events earlier in the drama, but last part is just tragic. Usually, when a drama ends like that, it makes me hate the whole story. But this one is just so good, that I still love it. Overall, the story was amazing and I love that ending was connected to the beginning. Just be prepared that it starts quite lightly, but gets darker.", "I donot know how I really feel about this serial. It started off pretty well. The story line and the character development of Soo and So made sense. But I dont know if this is me but sometimes there are loopholes in Korean serials. Like characters show really exaggerated reactions to mere things which ends up changing the storyline very radically. Like Wang so's reaction to finding out that Soo had loved Wook at one point was far too exaggerated and so was Soo's unwillingless to mend their misunderstanding. I can understand why Soo wanted to leave the palace, the king was changing into the man she feared he would become, the Queen's relationship with him as well as her increasing loneliness, but still i felt that her reaction to her servants death felt a bit exaggerated.At times I also struggled with Soo's character, She was shown to be a hot headed girl who was outspoken and bold in the beginning but soon it transformed into a typical Mary sue who was everyone's savior and was flawless.I think the main fault of Soo was refusal to marry the King, In the goodness of her heart she made the first move to priortise the throne over their relationship and I think that is where the conflicts started.\nI also felt that there were too many questions which were left unanswered, Why had Soo timetravelled? Who was the astronomer and how did he appear in the end? Why did Wang So's mother hate him- I mean his abuse at the hands of family was an important part of the story but the cause of his mom's resentment was never explained...? The last episode also felt poorly directed with chunks and bits and pieces from the past mixing into the present. I felt that the resolution was never reached and as an audience i didnot feel satisfied with the ambigous decalaration of the king that \" He will find her again\"\nThe one thing which does make this series worth watching is Joon Gi lee's acting. It is perfect. From his tranformation from a cruel warrior to that of a lover to that of a blood thirsty king, everything is perfect. \nIn the end I would say that with better direction and better script handling this could have been a much more amazing serial. I guess a season 2 could do a better job of satisfying the audience :/", "When I'm done watching the other korean dramas, I'm in a doubt if I should watch this one. But after I watched this, it hooked me. It's already months ago when this drama ended but I'm here, still searching updates about them and wanting to watch it again. I also watched this on a live stream and I don't understand anything what they're saying but based on their emotions, I feel that I know what's really going on. I'm even more emotional when I watched them like that. The acting is super b! I'm very impressed to all the actors especially Lee Joon Gi, who I know is very perfect on every korean historical dramas and Kang Ha Neul, who gave me goosebumps with his acting. Also, the other actors did a great job. The stage production and costumes will make you thought if this is a TV or a film production. 10/10 for me!When I'm currently watching this, I'm kinda disappointed to myself because I think back then, \"Why I am only watching this now? I should watched this before anything else\" That really make me regret back then lol-If you'll be watching this, brace yourself with a lot of emotions. You may find this a cute love story with a love triangle going on, but when the story goes on, a tragic moments happening and you may curse a lot of people when the Princes begins to battle for the throne. You'll find whose greedy and not. What they priorities most. Love or Power? Family or Love?I hope you'll enjoy watching this bcoz I never forget this one and it will be remembered as one of the best. On all dramas I watched, they were on my top 3 list. The ending may not as you expected as similar as the original series \"Scarlet Heart\" from China. But it's a good ending I think it's better that way that they didn't copy the exact ending happened on the original series. BTW, Lee Joon Gi mentioned that it's impossible to have a season 2, who knows. Maybe a miracle happened.", "Superb drama. The starting may feel entirely opposite to end. Very romantic drama. The story line is also perfect. The ending might be little different kind of sad ending but if there comes a season2 it will be good. The love scenes is very cute. The acting of all the cast is superb. I loved the part of Baekhyun as Wang Eun. Hes very cute and his acting is also very cute and emotional. All the actors are extra smart with great attitude. All the couples had great chemistry. The dressing of the actors and actress and their hairstyle is gorgeous. There were some scenes still hanging so it's better to have season2. That would make the drama perfect. The fight scenes were also nice. I can give it a 10/10 rating.", "What looked first to me as a soap opera, turned out to be a fantastic drama adding up more and more suspense from one episode to the next. The acting is just great. A lot of facial expression, a lot of gestures, only little action scenes. A great part is about how characters change for the good and for the bad throughout their lives. Many scenes are heartbreaking, if you follow the plot your emotions will be stirred up. Just the last episodes has elements in it that should have been left out since these elements distract from the overall message.It seems that they plan on producing a second series, if so, I am definitely looking forward to the sequel.", "I can't give less than 10 stars. I love the script, I love the music but the more I love the Moon Lovers, Wang So and Hae Soo. Their love is so deeply", "Its nice .....every episode was interesting...\nHea Soo role is maintainted dominantly in every episode...\nshe in present highly disappointed at life...as the situation carries...she was fallen into deep waters..when she woke up she realises ...she is in past...\nlater gets attached to prince's of palace....\nShe said no to 10th prince proposal....as she cant share her husband...\nwhen comes to Wong Soo...his marriage is highly expected with heroine..\nbut ...it happen with another person....\nHae Soo...no one is as before when thay had a desire for throne....(4th prince and 8th prince)\nat the ending heroine become the wife of another prince....\nstill....her love to Wong Soo never declined and think and think of him...and died in the age and becomes alive in present ....\nstory with best dialogue in \"I WONT LET U GO\"....", "An unexpected drama that lives up to it's expectations. No wonder why it is still on the \"hot to watch\" lists even it ended months ago! Well, the story is about a girl who dies in a lake accident and she magically goes back in time, during the kingdom period, where she takes the body of a lady. She develops strong relationships with the princes of the dynasty, and the drama focuses on her story and how she enters the palace as a court lady and her relationship with the fourth prince, who is described as a wolf. All in all, I really loved her story, though I did find some disadvantages. First of all, the coming \"back\" from the future didn't really work, though it was forgotten after the second episode and it was only revisited in the last episode. Also, the comic acts were not that good, and they made the drama a little silly. Plus, the romance was strong, but I felt that the chemistry was lucking, though I did like the fact that she didn't develop feelings for the prince from the start, as it would have made the drama dull (twenty episodes long already it would have been tiring to watch if the romance had started from episode four!). Another thing that is only my personal opinion is that the male lead didn't work for me. As I'm not his biggest fan, I didn't quite identify with the romance, as he looked rather cruel at times and like a child in others, not to mention the \"You are only mine\" possessiveness didn't work for me at all! However, I did enjoy this drama. The performances were okay (the first episodes were a little awkward though), the costumes and the settings were breathtaking and the action and royal twists were enough to keep the interest high till the very end. Another plus was that the lead lady's character was well developed, as you could she her growing up from a bold girl to a respected head court lady. So, 6 out of 10.", "I felt the warmth of love, relations, bondings, funny moments, lots of emotions, climaxes and many heart breaking betrayal. This is by far the best historical drama for me. Omg I cried so many times. Watching this drama is an eye punishment for us..", "Honestly, i started to watch recently korean dramas, and I now watch them with a bit of addiction. Scarlet Heart is one of the best I have seen, however, the actors made me watch it also and not only the story. I tried to watch chinese version but after few minutes I just could not.. guess I can't see anyone else as Wang So than L.J.G. He is really amazing and I watched almost all his dramas.. Scarlet Heart is worth your time... however, you might end up with false hopes for a sequel like me. Guess I ll need few years to get over that ending . Hope LJG will play in more hystorical dramas in future!", "This is the second k-drama I've seen so far and it managed to top the first one, to which I also gave 10 stars. I don't know how this is possible, honestly! There are no words to describe how much I love it, although it broke my heart so many times. I may add more about it in the future (if an edit option is even available; I don't it's the first time I write a review here), I just couldn't help but jump here immediately after I finished it, I'm just way too emotional now, sorry about this review being such a mess! I'll say one last thing for now, though: if you were wondering whether or not to watch it and you decided to see what the reviews says about it, so that you can decide, then take this as a sign - I'm telling you: \"WATCH IT RIGHT NOW!\"", "I watched this drama after watching Lawless lawyer of Lee joon gi and I must say it didn't disappoint me.

At the time, it was a bit refreshing for a K drama, both for its unusual premise and excellent incorporation of manga drawings and anime scenes throughout the series.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Hana is a talented but reclusive Japanese manga artist who takes an interest in the lives of an elderly neighbor lady and the elderly gentleman who hand sweeps the street outside her home every morning at 3 am. One day, the gentleman passes away, and Hana's family is tasked by the community to take care of his estate and remains since he has no family. The lady soon shows up however to abscond with the ashes of the gentleman who forever swept her street. Fascinated by these 2 people, Hana sets off to find out more about their relationship. During her journey, she uncovers a 60 year love story between the lady and gentleman. She then tries to tell their love story in the form of her new manga series with the help of some other characters that show up along the way.This series started off exceptionally well, and, I was quickly taken in by its subtle and unique method of storytelling. Unfortunately, it hits a wall HARD during the middle to latter half of its run time, as it falls back on so many tired clich\u00e9 driven subplots and typical overly forced melodrama. I really wanted to skull punch the people in charge for practically ruining it all. I sometimes wish I had some all encompassing authority or magical ability to edit these shows as I see fit before they air; this is absurd of course, and, I do realize the nature of, and time constraints involved with, airing KTV shows which must fulfill a certain number of predetermined episodes. I'm rambling on here, but the basic problem with this show is that it is an excellent story that is stretched out way longer than it should be.There is a lot to like about this series though: The epic love story mystery at the core is interesting, and the efforts of Hana and her cohorts to bring this story to life while dealing with their own love interests and problems along the way is often entertaining. Also, the drawings and animation utilized throughout the series are superbly implemented, and, the 4 main leads/stars are all quite good actors/actresses. I really liked the soundtrack too; the title song and the dramatically cued love song are both still stuck in my head after all these years, and that's saying something! I also did very much like the final episode and how the series ended overall.The main problem with this series is that it's simply too long. As a result, the forced melodramatic nonsense gets out of hand as the series progresses, before it finally gets back on track. All of the characters are quite likable to begin with, but their melodramatic \"de-evolution\" makes you end up not wanting to like any of them. Here's a breakdown of the 4 main characters:1. Hana. She's shy, introverted, and doesn't like people or believe in love. She avoids interacting with the world and finds solace only in her drawings. She supposed to slowly start to emerge from her shell as the series progresses, and she does, but she also spends a lot of time just being cold and sullen, before the show finds its footing again.2. Hana's love interest. This guy is a handsome young resourceful dude who has a knack for storytelling and interacting with people. He helps Hana come out of her shell as they both work towards completing the new manga, and, they begin to fall in love with each other along the way. Unfortunately, he also spends a good number of episodes throwing violent temper tantrums and whining a lot. At one point, he literally spends 2-3 full episodes as a drunkard who does nothing but cry nonstop.3. The doctor/psychiatrist. He's a very successful and good looking MD, and a highly reasonable man. He happens to be a huge closet manga fan, and, he possesses a gigantic stash of same that's hidden in an awesome secret room which he escapes to in order to relax with his hobby. He's a big fan of Hana's work as well, and, he soon becomes smitten with her when they meet face to face due to a series of events. His love for Hana is clearly misplaced, which would be OK if he didn't end up coming across as more of an obsessed and creepy stalker more than anything else. 4. The woman who produces the manga series (probably my favorite character). She's an attractive single woman that is focused on her career as an independent producer. She's hard working, and very good at what she does, and she's a perfect match for the doc referenced above that she has a crush on. It's perfectly clear that she and the doc should be together, but he's obsessed with Hana at this point, and there's no reasoning with him. So, she reacts accordingly and spends a lot of time just being a manipulative woman who pulls whatever strings she needs to in order to get what she wants (both professionally and personally).This synthetic melodrama really drives me crazy! Why are the writers and director intentionally trying to make us hate these characters?...NEWS FLASH: This does not make the show any better or more watchable, and it actually does the exact opposite. I'm perfectly fine if the melodrama flows naturally, but if not, DON'T FORCE IT! You've practically ruined what could have been an excellent show because of your mistaken belief that more melodrama ALWAYS equals better series. IT DOES NOT!If you're going to watch this show, I recommend skipping over episodes 9-14 or thereabouts; you'll be glad if you do.So, 6.5-7.5 out of 10 stars. Watchable, but should have easily been way better! 7 stars it is!"], "1269": [], "1270": [], "1271": [], "1272": ["I love this drama very much. Every teenager plays a role.

Also, I would be lying if I said I didn't watch it to see Song Hae-Gyo as the main role.Unfortunately I was caught by these traps.Firstly, if you are watching this movie in order to learn historic facts, don't bother. Almost half of the movie involves senseless fighting and unpleasant sensuality, while trying to immerse viewers into the absent plot line.**TINY SPOILER** Clich\u00e9s are existent. It's the same old thing: Two young friends are tragically split up because of an overly dominating father, the girl goes through physical/mental hardships (becoming a kisaeng) while the boy trains to fight enemies and ultimately to meet back with his childhood friend. **SPOILER END** The first parts of the movie pathetically try to involve viewers emotionally by using children to enhance our pity for their tragic separation, and grab the attentions of fight-scene lovers by including a brutal battle scene. While these kept me interested in the short-term, I can't say the same about the rest of the film.Some good points: What can I say about korean movie actors? Beautiful, accurate and gets-to-the-point expressions. Although this film was Song Hae-Gyo's first movie, she does an incredible job bringing up clear emotions according to the situation.The atmosphere was excellent almost throughout the whole film. Dark, brutal and tense lighting keeps audiences suspenseful and wondering what terrible event will happen next. (Very similar to Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) The music is average, as it doesn't include memorable scene-music (like Old Boy did) but suited the situation alright.Overall, in my opinion, this movie used korean must-know historic facts and famous actors to make people interested and to get them to watch it. This is not excellent, but not a disaster either. You may enjoy it if you're a fan of tragic love stories, but other than that, nothing is special here. 5/10", "It's a film worth watching for its beauty - beauty of the actress playing Hwang Jin Yi, beauty of costumes and location. It's valuable for those who are interested in Korean culture and history.It is also good to know the story of the famous courtesan. Anyway, apart from its visual values the film doesn't offer too much. The love story presented there isn't convincing at all, actually, it even sounds a bit illogical and therefore didn't move me at all. The story of their love was somehow neglected and not fully shown in the initial stage and then at the end the director focused on it and was apparently trying to make it touching and moving. The film seemed to have too many plot lines, none of them fully developed, so actually it was neither a good love story nor a proper biographical or historical film plus it was a bit boring. All in all, it's not a bad idea to watch it just to admire traditional clothes, music and beautiful actresses but if you are looking for something ambitious and really interesting, you may be disappointed.", "such a beautiful and touching movie! i was amazed how they presented an artist's heart, and an artist's calling. i enjoyed so much watching this movie and i appreciate the tenderness and deep understanding of artist's conditions, not only during that time, but in our times also. i am also a bit sad because not so many people understood the message of the movie. there is some criticism concerning some minor mistakes. anyhow, i would like to express my gratitude and to congratulate the team and the actors who played in this drama. there were no bad people. there were people who were hurt, there were people who sought for healing their souls. and the art, the pure and true art is able to do it. i believe in this message of the movie. thank you!", "I had always had a soft spot for SHK since first seeing her in Autumn Tale and My Girl and I, after hearing so much about this film while it was in production I had made up my mind to go see it.unknown to some, there is also a drama that was made and was released a few months prior to this movie. I wanted to get a hold on the storyline and a feel for the character before seeing this movie so i watched the drama. it was absolutely brilliant. the main girl in there, Ha Ji Won, was excellent, she had this proud-ness about her that was either endearing or dis-likable, but to me she was such a likable character,even if she wasn't lovable, and the dancing was so beautiful, especially the sword dance and the calling for justice dance she did to save her lover.with that feeling i went into the movie, i knew from the forgo that the movie would be different, would have different feel and the character would be different too. but i never expected to not like Hwang Jin Yi, or find her a bore.But i did, she was so utterly boring and the director tried way to hard for the viewers to feel sorry for Hwang's situation that it really ruined it for me. one of the reason the drama was so good was that Hwang in the drama was never portrayed to be a sympathetic character, the path she tread was the one she had chosen, she had no one to blame but herself, she never asked for our sympathy, and we don't feel the need to give it to her.the movie's Hwang was the total opposite, we see her as being forced into the situation, taking crap from people and being betrayed by her best friend then abandoned by him. all the makings for a sympathetic character, but although i did feel sorry for her as would anyone with a bit of compassion in them but felt like a cheap shot. and i was left feeling like I'm been forced into the feeling.what really did me in the most, was the fact that Hwang was suppose to be renowned for her beauty, intelligence and artistic nature in both drawing and dancing, the movie only portrayed her as a beauty with some brains, there was any particular scene that made us go 'wow she's so smart' and the most damming of them all, no dancing.the worst thing this movie did was being un-memorable, it was such a shame, as i expected it to be much better.if anyone has the chance, skip this movie and watch the series, but if you want to watch both then watch the movie first, there is no way you can stand this movie if you've already seen the drama. one of the stupidest thing i did was go watch the drama first."], "1274": [], "1275": [], "1276": [], "1277": [], "1278": [], "1279": ["What's Up Fox is a 2006 16 episode Korean romance drama about a younger man (24) and older woman (33). A theme throughout the show is to follow your heart not your head for happiness. The writer wrote the better known My Name is Kim Sam-Soon (2005). The drama centers around a middle class mother and her 2 daughters. Byung Hee, the older daughter, is 33 and a reporter for a men's magazine. Joon Hee, the younger daughter, is 24 and a model. Byung Hee's best friend has a younger brother, Chul Su, who returns after a 2 year around the world trek. Byung Hee gets drunk one night and Chul Su is sent to bring her home safely. They end up sleeping together. Chul Su pursues Byung Hee but she's afraid of the age difference and rebuffs him in favor of a more age appropriate doctor. Chul Su won't give up and Byung Hee eventually realizes she loves him. Family opposition and the army provide the obstacles for our couple after that.What I liked about What's Up Fox: 1. Likable couple. The actor playing our male lead, Chul Su, was cute and appealing. The actress playing our female lead, Byung Hee, had good chemistry with the male lead and excelled portraying the character's struggle to take the risk to date a younger man. 2. Equally likable secondary couple. The younger sister had a interesting hate to love relationship with a much older man (she was 24 and he was 42). You never found out what the secret of his bum was though. 3. Realistic ending. Neither couple walked into the sunset holding hands but you felt each couple was going to make a solid go of their relationship. Our main couple has to deal with tough questions and does not provide the easy out. Their relationship evolves and has merit because of the obstacles they overcome together. What I was less fond of: 1. Chul Su's sister was a bit over the top in her negative reaction to her brother and best friend finding love. When she submitted him for the 2 year army stint, that was a low blow. 2. I found the other suitor Dr. Bae boring which was intentional for our heroine to pick the safe Dr. Bae or the passionate Chul Su."], "1280": [], "1281": [], "1282": [], "1283": [], "1284": [], "1285": ["I love how they explain moves, tactics, geography-everything on the map.", "If this series had a poster it would be say something like \"The story of one of Korea's greatest hereoes\" But just as applicable would be a line spoken by one of the main characters, which went something like \"Nobody remains a friend forever, and nobody remains an enemy forever.\nI'll divide my review into sections.\nPerformances.\nI'll give names of characters, as I'm not very good at remembering actors names.

This is a highly recommended one as it shows lessons on how a person matures after he learns the value of being self-succifient and independent.Aside from that, it provides a viewer lessons in life that materialism is not the ultimate reason why a person is happy in this world and the we can make plans but never control the results of it. Yoon Eun-hye is definitely a talented actress. Deserves to win the Best Actress Awards for her role in this drama. She is EXTREMELY GORGEOUS as well. Better than some of the good-looking actresses in Hollywood.Her screen presence is great!!! She is now my favorite Korean actress. I like her more than my other two favorites namely: Son Ye-Jin and Jun Ji- Hyun. Finally,this KDrama is very entertaining and highly recommended.Definitely,a must-see!!!", "I was introduced to Eun Hye Yoon thru \"Goong\" (aka \"Princess Hours\") (2006), which I've always felt is a severely overrated series that gets pretty darn boring at times. Yoon's performance was the main reason why I was moderately satisfied after finishing it. Afterward I moved on to \"Coffee Prince\" (2007), which was more entertaining but not quite as great as many claimed it to be. Nevertheless, I became a fan of Yoon's and decided to seek out everything in her portfolio. This lead me to \"The Man of the Vineyard\" (2006), which is fantastic and one of the best K-dramas I've seen so far.After a series of unfortunate incidents, an aspiring fashion designer is coerced into working on her grandfather's vineyard for one year. Along the way she bonds with a surly farmer. On paper this series (16 episodes, 70 minutes each) is one of the more simplistic K-dramas, but it's surprisingly one of the most entertaining because it creates a fun environment from start to finish. The high dose of charming humor helps a lot, as does the strong chemistry between the actors. Unlike many K-dramas, there's very little melodrama and the pacing never seems to drag. The characters are nicely developed and the romantic conflicts are strong, especially when the two other love interests start to claw their way into the mix. Fun stuff that's worth seeking out.FYI, Yoon's recent series entitled \"My Fair Lady\" (2009) is also a lot of fun and very fast paced. I highly recommend that one as well."], "1289": [], "1290": [], "1291": [], "1292": [], "1293": [], "1294": [], "1295": [], "1296": [], "1297": [], "1298": ["Well, I saw this movie on the flight Paris-Seoul in August 2002. I guess if you don't speak korean, the only chance you'll have to see this film is to grab a Koreanair flight... Unfortunately ! If recently in France, Asian cinema is getting stronger, it is more the japanese and chinese/HK/Taiwanese cinema that are getting the lion's share. Nothing much for the korean... It is the story about a guy who became partially amnesiac after a car accident. No big deal (except some embarassing gaffes) but he makes strange dreams about a girl he loved and whom he doesn't remember. His doctor tells him that this is a way for the memory to reconstruct itself, it means that this is an important fact, and that he should try to remember it. So our hero, who's weather man on TV, starts an investigation : who was that girl (whose face we don't see of course). So the movie is about this investigation. The guy is reconstructing his past, his college's years, but since he was kind of a secret guy, his pals, guys and girls, never knew whom he was really in love with... Obsessed with finding the girl he once loved to reconstruct his memory, he starts to see things differently at work and he doesn't notice he's slowly but surely falling in love again with a real girl, not a dream. And when he does notice that, he wants to give up his quest because that mystery girl doesn't mean anything anymore. Will he be able to embark in a new story and finding out why and by whom he was so obsessed in his past ?... As you guessed, it is a nice little romantic movie, but so far from the Meg Ryan's... Everything is done subtly and you enjoy being carried away in that story because it doesn't explain things like you're 12 and not knowing anything about human relationships. And people do not act like they are stupid teenagers who don't dare giving a kiss... It is not corny mainly because most of the movie is about reconstructing a past love just to know the ID of that girl, nothing more. And the present love slowly emerges from that, and when we become aware of that, other problems rise... Overall, if it is not very surprising (still a little bit), it is still very pleasant because the way it is done and very charming mostly because of the actors I must admit. Charming enough to fight the sleepiness caused by the jetlag... How many movies can do that for you ?", "This movie is adorable! I normally wouldn't see a Korean film since I don't understand Korean.BUT a friend showed this to me and I loved it!!! It is such a cute love story, sort of like a Korean \"Sleepless In Seattle\" or \"While you are Sleeping\". It is a story of a man who loses some of his memory and tries to piece it all together. While this is happening, there are flashbacks to the past. It is very intricate and you want to immediately watch it again after the first time just to see all the clues you missed in the first time. I'm normally NOT attracted to Asian men BUT the leading man gets MORE AND MORE adorable as the movie continues.The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because nothing is perfect.", "Very interesting movie about a weatherman who is slowly regaining bits and pieces of his memory after an accident, and the pieces are leading him on a quest to find a college sweetheart known only by him as \"Rainbow.\" But he just cannot remember who Rainbow is. He was always secretive in school, so none of his college friends know the lady's identity. This is a mystery romance, well-acted and well-made. The \"rainbow\" mystery in a way reminds of the \"rosebud\" mystery in the movie \"Citizen Kane.\" (This review is in regard to the dvd version with English subtitles.) The Korean film industry has another winner in \"Over The Rainbow.\"", "This is one of those films that leave you with a pleasant feeling inside. It is a mystery and love story all in one. The way the film unfolds is so delightful. You find yourself wondering and hoping at the same time. There is nothing dramatic in the story, but the drama nevertheless is there... in the ordinary unfolding of daily life.The two actors play their parts well. It is easy to act dramatic parts dramatically, but it is very difficult to bring out drama in everyday events in life. The actors succeed in bringing out the drama through the course of things that we do every day and yet take for granted. All in all, a fine film.Highly recommended."], "1299": [], "1300": [], "1301": [], "1302": [], "1303": [], "1304": [], "1305": [], "1306": ["I finished watching all 16 episodes of ALONE IN LOVE.It is highly recommended.It was worth all the 16 hours of viewing.ALONE IN LOVE is story was about a divorced couple,who are struggling to move past their relationships,in their journey of finding their one true love.Kam Woo-seong plays Dong-jin Lee and Son Ye-Jin plays Eun-ho Lee,both as the male and female divorcees respectively.Credit should also be given to Lee Ha-and Kong Hyeong-jin for providing great performance in their supporting roles.The story was both realistic as well as highly unpredictable until the last few minutes of the final episode of the series.Also,it was a HAPPY ENDING for change since Koreans are known for sad endings.Son Ye-Jin was great in this TV series.She once again proves that she is one of the best actresses if not the best in Asia.The viewers are given a lot of information in real life situations about love that can be useful not only to married couples but also to those who are engaged,in a relationship and those people who have yet to fall in love.The series has a good mix of drama and comedy.Not a dull moment in this 16 hour long TV series.", "This is real romance! First mature Korean show I've seen. This isn't a love story, a life story is more appropriate. It's a very beautiful-powerful representation of relations between people with awesome combination of lightness and seriousness; not only love but also friendship, siblings' love etc. Overall mood of drama is light; often it's L-O-L kind of funny without being idiotic and very heartwarming and sometimes it gives feeling of emptiness. I'm a guy and I'm not ashamed to admit that I shed many tears of happiness while watching Alone in Love. I felt like I was one of the members of their friend circle. I was attached emotionally with each character. I felt emotionally saturated after going through this lovely show! Eun-ho (SYJ) and Dong-jin's (KWS) views in narration on their life and love are inspiring and can be lessons for most people. Their views can be useful for any person-any age, those who are in love, those who were in love and especially those who yet to be in love! Acting/cast:Almost everyone was A+ in acting including guest roles! Gong Hyung-Jin is brilliant and funny as an unconfident gynecologist and played an important role as best friend of main lead. Son Ye-Jin: I don't need to talk about her. She's proved actress. She is flawless throughout whole show but her best performance was in the last two episodes. Lee Ha-Na: I'm very very impressed by this actress! This was her first role in her career still she managed to perform it brilliantly. She was very natural, great expressions and dialogue delivery. Sometimes she was suppressed by the presence of Son Ye-Jin but still she outclassed SYJ in many scenes! She definitely deserved her New Star award. Kam Woo Sung: Poor guy, every other actor in this drama got acknowledgment for their acting by getting either best actress; top excellence, New Star or supporting actor-actress awards but this poor man missed it! I think his acting was best in the whole cast! Clever dialogue delivery! BEST! Music: Music was mesmerizing. I couldn't find OST album yet so I don't know specific track names to point out but I loved the music! Pros: -Very realistic -Romantic! -No angst and typical Asian show riddles -Excellent combination of all emotions -Perfect casting & acting! -Strong and likable characters -No idols -0% nonsense -No annoying characters -Stable pace Cons: None, still I couldn't find anything negative except this was highly addictive. It felt like a 16 hour long movie! Who should watch this? As I said it's mature so it'll definitely suit mature audience but I think it's more advisable to recommend it to younger audience (I'm also in this group!) to give slight idea about love! So in short everyone! Highly recommended for everyone! If someone wants to watch a Korean show and wants to watch only one then I'd recommend Alone in Love. I'd easily sideline my previous joint #1 Salaryman and Evasive Inquiry Agency! Who should avoid this? -Those who want adrenaline rush in everything. -Those who want to live in fantasy. -Those who want to watch mushy, kiddo's, 'Love @ 1st sight', \"I love you\u0085I love you too!\"/\"I can't live without you\u0085\" kind of romance."], "1307": [], "1308": [], "1309": [], "1310": [], "1311": [], "1312": ["The previous reviewer dwelled on the penis thing and the erotic aspect of this film, but I think he, along with many others, missed the point. It's partly the fault of the advertising campaign, which I understand emphasized Jo YeoJung's (as well as other actors') nude scenes -- but I don't know how anyone can still retain the impression that this movie is an erotic bodice-ripper after actually watching it. This is a dark, perilous journey through the obsessions and grudges of people who cannot stop running lest they fall behind, and the sweat is all of the cold kind.The said scenes involving nudity and sexuality are not in the least erotic, nor did I find Kim DongWook's reaction to the coitus-by-the-book(literally) as the hapless young king at all comedic, intentionally or otherwise; rather he did a fine job of assaying a pathetic and desperate character trapped in an intolerable situation, and his mental near-collapse was almost palpable. And the supporting characters' stories did not interfere with the unfolding of the main plot for me -- they were not subplots so much as back stories for the characters' motivations, and served to flesh out, not complicate, the plot.Aside from the mostly fine direction and the acting -- which latter ranged from decent (in a few cases) to very good (mostly) -- for me the art direction and cinematography were particular standouts. While most historical epics tend to emphasize sumptuous costumes and the splendor of the architecture and ornamentation, this movie did the opposite; while it is visually rich in its own, gloom-laden way, everything in it is in dark, muted colors as if it were dyed with tea, the ladies wear little jewelry and the sets are kept very lean, to sometimes very striking, almost expressionistic, effect, as when HwaYeon's maid is assigned new, better quarters of her own after catching the King's eye, but the room is entirely empty, and the woman is shown laughing in semi-hysterical self-congratulation on a tiny mat on an otherwise bare floor.There are many, many scenes shot at very close range, often lit by simulated candlelight at night, creating an overall claustrophobic feel that visually replicates the suffocating atmosphere of the intrigue-riddled court these people endured. Fittingly, the scenes of violence are presented suddenly and starkly, with minimal cues in the soundtrack, which makes them all the more shocking yet realistic.While not exactly a masterpiece, this movie is a well-thought out and well-executed production, much superior to the kind of titillating fluff it is made out to be by some. It definitely deserves a thoughtful watch.", "Unlike the recent South Korean period dramas, the movie has a notable anachronistic feeling. It seems its background is the Joseon dynasty(1392-1910) considering the design of architectures in the film, but there is also the influences from the Goryeo dynasty(918-1392) in the characters' costumes and other details. They behave like the people living during the Joseon dynasty, but, as far as I know, there was not any incident during that period which can possibly inspire the lurid story of the film, and I have never heard about the king's mother presiding over the copulation ritual of her son and daughter-in-law in the next room.But, despite its fictional world, the ruthless pursuit of power in the palace is a familiar story you have encountered in other stories. The king is dead due to an unidentified cause, and the king's mother(Park Ji-yeong), who is actually his stepmother, now holds the power to decide who will be the next king. She quickly puts her own son, Prince Seong- won(Kim Dong-wuk), on the throne, and she also swiftly eliminates her opponents including the previous king's father-in-law.In such a circumstance like that, the previous king's wife, Hwa-yeon(Cho Yeo-jeong), naturally has lots of worry about not only her future and but also her young son's future. He is just a child at present, but this innocent kid is already deemed as a potential threat to the kingship, and he can be killed at any time if the king's mother and her followers have a chance to get a good reason for that. Some of South Korean audiences have never heard of Lady MacBeth or Richard III, but they will be reminded of several bloody incidents during the Joseon dynasty or other dynasties preceding that. King Danjong of the Joseon dynasty was dethroned by his uncle, who became the next king, and then this young boy was killed later when he was thought to be too much of trouble(believe or not, it was said that this horrific decision was strongly supported by his great uncle). In case of Prince Young-Chang, he was murdered by King Gwanghaegun of the Joseon dynasty just because he was a more legitimate heir to the throne than the king himself. Anything could be committed for absolute power in those days, you know.Unlike his ruthless mother, Prince Seong-won has other thoughts about his sister-in-law, and we know why. While he was merely a prince, he met her in her father's house, and he has been obsessed with her since then. His mother already sets him up with the other woman as his queen when he becomes the king, but he still wants Hwa-yeon in spite of his mother's warning. It may be not that bad to sleep with the deceased brother's wife(well, he is the king, isn't he?), but it can be fatal to sleep with someone who can threaten the power.The situation becomes more complicated after another player of this dangerous game of palace intrigue appears in the palace. His name is Kwon-yoo(Kim Dong-wuk), who was Hwa-yeon's former lover in the past. When he tried to elope with Hwa-yeon before she was sent to the place as the previous king's new wife, he was captured and castrated by Hwa- yeon's father, and now he enters the palace as one of new eunuchs. While he is quickly promoted enough to be near the king, he becomes also a little closer to Hwa-yeon though he lacks a certain body part crucial for rekindling their feelings in the past. Can she trust him as a close ally? And does she really have some feelings for him as he guesses?You never can be sure about them because of the understated but competent performances by Jo Yeo-jeong and Kim Min-joon. Revealing real feelings in the palace can be a fatal blow to your fate, and they must hide their emotions and thoughts as much as possible to survive. Jo Yeo- jeong is good as a woman who gradually becomes as ruthless and cunning as her enemies through her need to survive. When she comes to know that the king wants her, she see it as an opportunity to win the game, and she is determined to manipulate him to turn against her devious mother- in-law.Meanwhile, clueless and reckless Guem-OK(Cho Eun-ji), a maid who has served for Hwa-yeon, finds herself in a serious situation way over her head. She is forced to copulate with the king when he is very frustrated over his desire toward Hwa-yeon, and we can say that she is virtually raped, but, what do you know, she feels a lot better to see her changed position as one of the king's concubines. Unfortunately, while intoxicated with her newly gained power, she does not have the slightest idea about how dangerous the power game can be between the women in the palace.The king's mother is the most powerful and dangerous player in this perilous game, and Park Ji-young gives a juicy villainous performance which ably supplies grand gestures whenever they are required. The king's mother has probably done many terrible things for protecting his son and making the throne ready for him, but it is not easy for her to resist the power behind the throne \u2013 and now her dear son is becoming one of the major blocks in her grand plan.", "The problem with this movie is that it goes in a complex and jumbled direction and some parts of it lead to hardly anything all that effective. The cinematography and acting is good and some parts are just cruel which leaves a bit of a impression on how things worked during the Joseon Dynasty. When it comes to males their manhood means just about everything to them(well for most men at least) and their pride comes from the length of it all. Even when they compete it comes down to their ego which is basically a penis measuring competition. The plot contrived of something more than what it is. And when it comes down to it the moral of this movie is to never mess with a man's penis or you will face the consequences. As comedic as that sounds that is basically the message of this movie although everything is a bit jumbled. Besides the penis aspect of it all it sort of reminded me of the 2010 Korean movie \"The Servant\" which Jo Yeo-Jeong who is the lead actress in this was part of. Because both movies are erotic and sexual while dealing with the distance a man would go for their love or the person they lust over. While also dealing with a person that is constantly getting in the way of if all. So the plot in this is basically about a woman that tries to save his lover's life when they decided to run away together and get caught. And thus she volunteers to become a concubine for the king in order to save her lover's life. But soon a bunch of conspiracies happen in the palace when the king passes away and the prince is in love well in lust over the concubine way before she became a concubine and finds her in the palace before the king's death. And during the conspiracy the queen who is very cruel and cold gets involved as well. And there is constant arguing and conflict between the selfish prince and the tyrant queen because of the concubine. And later the concubine finds her previous lover but is shocked to know he has become a eunuch. So yeah this movie is quite a plot but besides few slightly shocking and erotic scenes nothing really makes this movie stand out. After the movie is finished nothing much about is memorable and the plot just doesn't stick. The plot isn't bad, in fact some parts of it is actually quite well written but there really isn't anything special about it and is unfocused as times. When it comes down to the core of it all besides the whole penis thing, is that just about all the characters in this act for their own self interest...I guess somethings never change. I give this movie a 6 because the climax slightly upgraded this movie.6/10", "You would think this movie is solely a movie about two guys wanting the same woman and being willing to do anything to have her. While this is a part of the film it is only a small part of a much larger drama that has much more to do with mothers.The title is a bit confusing and I can only assume that it was named such due to a \"Spilling the Beans\" moment in the film. There is sex but not in the volumes that one might expect by the title.The acting was quite well and I could really feel the emotional energy from the female characters coming through. It was filmed well but the scripting was convoluted in places and could've been delivered just as well with a few things omitted.Overall, I enjoyed the film. I liked our female characters and the obsessive nature, be it fueled by jealousy, lust or revenge, of the males. Glad I found and watched it and I will be recommending it as a nice work of dramatic historical fiction."], "1313": [], "1314": [], "1315": [], "1316": [], "1317": ["I watched this movie with no expectations and was brought on a roller coaster ride of emotions. All the highs and lows of love are here and presented through visually emotional camera work as well low-key yet powerful acting. When I'd finished watching, there was a gut-wrenching feeling in me that lingered for days. There is little dialogue in this film. Yet it speaks volumes because of the performances of Lee Young-Ae and Yu Ji-Tae. Each look, each gesture, each simple touch said more than a thousand words. If you want a genuine portrayal of a love affair from its beginning to its end, then watch this.", "This isn't a film about plot, so I'll concentrate on describing the main characters. Sang-Woo is a single sound engineer living with his family. Eun-su is a radio show host who lives about 4 hours away, by herself in a small, somewhat messy apartment. They meet to record the sound of wind in a bamboo forest for her radio show, and a relationship develops between them. The film observes them over the course of the changing seasons in Korea, starting in the Spring both in terms of the calendar and their relationship.The pace is deliberate, and the characters don't really change much, but the film is beautiful and, not surprisingly, lovely to listen to, and it's definitely worth seeing. I think that the male lead (Ji-tae Yu) is particularly good in his role. My understanding is that the film won the top prize at Korea's equivalent to the Academy Awards.I saw this at the San Francisco International Film Festival on 4/21/2002, where an earlier showing was the U.S. premiere. The director was present to answer questions, through an interpreter, and one of his responses indicated that viewers who are more experienced in love tend to identify with the female lead, while those less experienced see themselves in the male character.", "Although Alfred Lord Tennyson said, \"Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all\", anyone who has endured the breakup of an intense relationship would not necessarily agree. Certainly not Lee Sang-woo, the young sound engineer from Seoul, Korea in Hur Jin-ho's exquisite second feature One Fine Spring Day (literally Spring day goes). In the film of quiet power, two young people meet, fall in love, then gradually pull back and withdraw, but the film is not about their circumstances, but about the impermanence of life and how we must learn to ride the roller coaster. Like Hur's 1998 film Christmas in August, it is a realistic and intimate work, filled with a touching lyricism that never succumbs to manipulative devices.Working to record sounds of nature for a radio station, Sang-woo and radio disc jockey Han Eun-su meet at a bus station in a most unusual way. Unable to wake her from a bench in the waiting room, he calls her on his cell phone even though she is sitting right next to him. As they work together, their relationship develops slowly. She has recently been divorced and he lives at home with his father, aunt, and grandmother. The joy of discovering a new relationship is conveyed against a background of nature \u0096 its mountains, forests, and streams and, as we listen to the two recording the sound of the wind against the bamboo and the wheat fields, we are struck by the mood of serenity created by the cinematography of Kim Hyeong-gyu and the original music of Jo Sung-woo, based on the French ballad, \"Plaisir D'amour\".Impermanence is a constant theme in the film and the seasons represent various stages in the character's relationship. To underscore the fleeting nature of love, Sang-woo's grandmother denies that her deceased husband was ever unfaithful to her and, barely in touch with reality, goes to the train station everyday to wait for him. Though Eun-su lives in the provinces, she and Sang-woo begin to meet each other after work and spend some nights together. On the surface, they are an attractive couple - warm, sensitive, and very cute together. But Hur drops hints that each, in their own way is eager to pull away from what looks like it might become a lasting relationship. Though the reason for their growing coolness toward each other is not specifically defined, she may be reacting to the fallout from her last marriage or may be put off by his tendency to cling. In his first real relationship, he may be having thoughts that it is too soon to close off other possibilities in life.Neither, however, communicates their fears and, like a flower that is not being nurtured, their relationship is allowed to wither. As she withdraws, he pursues her even more, giving her the upper hand and placing her in a controlling position and Sang-woo is run by his expectations and disappointment, drinking and hiding out when things start to turn sour. In \"One Fine Spring Day\", we learn that, as in the Buddhist tradition, life has the characteristics of instantaneity, impermanence, and decay and that the three realms are deceptive and illusory in nature. We share Sang-woo's discovery of the joy of love and also its confusion and pain. Literally, not too much happens in the film, and, on paper it sounds ordinary, but, like the poetry of Walt Whitman, if we look beneath the surface we can easily see the divine in the commonplace.", "This is another very quiet film by Hur about the relationship between two people.  Like \"Christmas in August\" the direction is such that excessive dialogue is unnecessary.  We know what the two people involved are thinking at all times through their eyes, the way the look (or don't look) at each other.It's a story that anyone who has had any experience in love will immediately recognize and get that \"I have been there\" feeling.  The film doesn't sympathize with one person or the other but you probably will empathize with one of them based on your own experiences in love and loss.  Two people fall in love, one of them falls out of love (or does she?), is anyone to blame?", "Although I didn't like April Snow, I have to admit that I got curious about it's clinical, meditative, and almost Ozu-like approach to start searching out its director's previous films. One Fine Spring Day is Hur Jin-Ho's second feature film. Surprisingly though, the film feels like it's been crafted by a master who's been making films for decades. One Fine Spring Day evokes a certain sense of maturity and control that deflects the low points of its spare plot. Sang-woo (Yu Ji-tae) is a sound engineer who lives with his father and his senile grandmother. He gets a job to record certain sounds of nature with beautiful radio DJ Eun-su (Lee Young-ae). Sang-woo, who seems to be an extrovert and Eun-su, who is more outgoing and openminded, get along very well and start a relationship. Their relationship, however, is not the type that would last forever as both characters are very different and both have issues that need to be resolved. Those seeking something that will provide for a fuzzy joyous romantic feeling would easily get disappointed with One Fine Spring Day. One Fine Spring Day, despite its rather light atmosphere, holds a bittersweet conclusion that feels all too real for comfort. It matches the joys of falling in love with the pangs of an unexplained break up. The beauty of the film doesn't emanate from the plot, or the characterizations, or even the technical merits, but from Hur's surehanded direction that never seems to stray from its melancholic tone. Hur doesn't waste time in dealing with heartwarming moments or scenes of melodramatic intensity. He satisfies himself with sincere moments of silence that somehow evoke great emotional weight. One Fine Spring Day is a lovely film. I loved the fact that it never breaks into serious drama or comedy. It stays right there, comfortable in the middle, chronicling in a very sure manner the failing relationship of the couple. It's very different from April Snow which I thought tried too hard to build up its setup with a more ominous atmosphere that bogs down whatever talent and effort Hur and the rest of his crew put in entirely.", "From the very beginning, this film reminds me of a Japanese filmmaker Ozu. Well, there are few lines for characters and little music, they exchange their feeling by their facial expression. The film has a stereoscope effect owing to describe the vast nature image. It is all the more interesting that the subtle movement of love is contrasted with that immense spring nature.I guess the impression of this film is dependent on each person because the film leaves room for thinking more deeply about their relationship and their character. Superficially, Eun-su looks a little wicked since she leaves him suddenly, but I think there is something about her. She was divorced once and she may need someone to rely on. Also, Sang-woo lost his mother and is seeking for maternity in Eun-su. Both want someone to depend on but what they want in their partner is different. So they keep passing each other.Like August in Christmas(the previous film of Jin-ho Hur), their love is one way. Namely, an young pure innocent person loves an elder person. And the elder one leaves him or her at the end. The film makes me wonder how and what the young learn through love. Do you think he can recover from the loss?", "I will not go into the details of the plot, but will make an attempt to explain the relationships between the two main characters.A divorced woman, who lives alone in her messy city apartment and occasionally drinks herself to sleep meets a guy by starting a new sound recording project. They were assigned to be a team, and slowly but surely their mutual attraction develops. The woman feels lonely and she takes it to a new level when she invites him to spend a night at her apartment. The guy has never had any serious relationships before. This is his first love. Before meeting her he leads a simple yet happy life with his dad and his grandma. His aunt occasionally visits the family to take care of the grandma who is slowly losing her memory. The guy is loved by his family and he loves them back. Later we learn that he lost his mom at an early age.Their relationships blossoms. The woman enjoys his company because he makes her life more orderly by bringing kimchi and making ramen noodles. Without him her sleeping patterns are completely messed up and she feels lonely. The guy enjoys making her happy, he practically glows with happiness (his co-workers and family started to notice) and would like to get serious about their future as a family. The woman insists on secrecy. She mentions that the guy may lose his job if somebody finds out about their affair. The guy is ready to give up his job in order to keep her - this is how serious he is. In reality, his sudden request to see his father scares her. She did not expect that he would get so serious about it so soon. She does not feel right about the relationship. She understands what a great guy he is but feels inadequate since she has already been divorced. Being torn from her desire to be with him and her guilt of being in a wrong relationship, she suggests to spend a month apart. When this does not work, she tells hims she wants to break up with him. She even starts a new (continues her old?) relationship to forget him.As with any person whose true love was rejected, he suffers a great deal and becomes almost a stalker. We do not see the tormented feeling the woman goes through, but we see the agony of the guy. He spends a night in a parking lot next to her apartment building, follows her to her friend's house and even goes as far as keying her lime green car. He is ready to give up his job for her, yet he does not get it: why did she leave him? His family and friends are very supportive of him. Then his grandmother dies.The woman calls him back. She wants to see him again.He comes to meet her, but when she mentions that she would like to continue their relationships, he rejects her. You can see that he still loves her, because this decision does not come easy to him. He has to make an enormous effort not to follow her when she walks away.You can also see that the woman loves him too. When she turns around and sees him standing, she could have come back and make him start over. But she finds the inner strength and empathy to let him go because she was not sure that she was the right person who could make him happy.", "I saw this film at the 2002 San Francisco International film festival and it was, by far, the best film of the ten I saw. Some of the others were so bad, that if it hadn't been for this one film, I would have considered my ten ticket pass to be a waste of time (if not money). This is a romantic film with a very cute and unique story line that alone, would make it worth seeing. But the sound editing and the cinematography really put it over the top in my opinion. One sound and visual sequence in a bamboo forest will stand out in my memory forever.Unfortunately, for those of us who would love to see it again, or those who have never seen it, this film did not get released in the US and is not available on DVD or video.", "When I finished watching this film, I was reminded of what poet Lord Tennyson said about love: 'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. And I agree with others who have commented here on the film that it s only if you have loved and had been loved that you fully appreciate the film.One aspect of the film that I found most interesting was that Eun-su (Lee Yoeng-Ae) and Sang-woo (Jit-taeYue) met and fell in love because of sound but yet the acting was mostly silent. A simple gesture or a grimace here and there conveyed with clarity the powerful emotions and inner turmoil of these two main characters.I am grateful that I saw the film. It was so refreshing and so different that it was sort of a catharsis and I actually said to myself, \"I needed that\" when it was over.", "Its not about plot, not about twist nor about something unbelievable. This is a film that concentrate on characters and their different points of view. Dialogues are very modest in expression. Director uses rather non-verbal communication. Shy look there, insecure touch there or actions that tells us more then words. All that accompanied by great cinematography complemented by sensual music or sounds of bamboo. Audience can enjoy that thanks to slow storytelling and long pauses filled with body language. Back to the story. Jin-ho Hur tells a story about 2 individuals and their evolving relationship. Sang-woo is a young sound technician inexperienced with strong feelings. He meets Eun-so recently divorced radio announcer. Director shows the beginning of their relationship with creating overwhelming atmosphere of excitement and happiness that even spreads on the audience. **Spoiler Alert**However just like in life at some moment everything starts to go wrong. Director don't give us clear answer what is going on because just as it happens in those situations you can only insinuate. From this point everyone starts to cheer only for one of the main characters. Those less experienced by love go with Sang-woo. Those that tasted ups and downs of loving stand with Eun-so no matter which sex they're representing. Ending is perfectly directed. As Eun-so and Sang-woo meet up after some time she puts him again at crossroads. As he declined its clear that he finally made peace with it. As she goes away we can clearly see his hesitation. In this moment thanks to film shot without depth of field her going away is like fading of a memory. ** End of Spoilers**As i mentioned before great cinematography is accompanied by amazing music and that builds great background to the story. However at some point this omnipresent music started to get on my nerves. I just think there is a little bit too much of it. As someone before me noted the easiest way to describe this film is to quote Alfred Lord Tennyson: \"Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all\"", "You might expect that this movie, like all the other common consumer movies, that would be like stereotypical features, but that's not the case. \nAlways the audience makes a general definition of the melodrama genre in his mentality, and in front of his default, he is directed to a film that is not far from its presuppositions.\nBut the creation of a romantic film that can literally deal with the petitions of an emotional relationship is praiseworthy.\nJoining and separating two verbs is an inseparable part of relationship in the cinema, but setting to these two is not attractive alone.\nRomance movie needs some kind of subject writing. In this context, it is a more successful film that set to detail.\nI saw a good spring day movie on a good spring day, the first day of the spring of 2018.\nWithout exaggeration, the other romantic films I had seen, was in far space.\nThe culmination of the story is a fascinating reminder of a collapsing and annihilating relationship in which both conflict different behaviors in spite of their psychological and internal reaction, despite the emotion they are involved with.\nThe point to be considered here is that the problem that originally causes conflict and heterogeneity in their relationship is precisely where the one is willing to agree, and the other does not want to, and this position is changing.\nEventually, in the end of our film, we face an approach that is not happy end at all and confirm the signature of the modern structure of the film.\nThis movie should be seen because of its state of affairs and suitable for today.", "I saw this film at the San Francisco film festival several years ago.

I don't want to bash this show too hard, as I want to try to be objective, and the series does have a few good things going for it; It's an interesting premise to base a show on, and I appreciated its attempt to try to convey a more darkly themed love story compared to the norm for KTV melodramas. There are several solid romantic and dramatic moments, and many sad ones, throughout, but you'll have to wade through a considerable amount of filler and nonsense to get to them. Ultimately, there are just too many issues that affect this show for it to be considered one of the better Korean melodramas.SPOILERS AHEAD!So, where did it go wrong?...I'll tell you: The primary problem with this show is that it simply can't sustain its 20 episode length. I frequently complain about Asian productions being way lengthier than they need be, but this series might be the most egregious offender of this issue that I've ever seen. As a result, its pacing is often incredibly sloooowwww! This is a constant and reoccurring problem that effects this show on every level; several episodes don't progress the story at all, plot lines seem to drag along indefinitely, etc. This issue even manifests itself in many individual scenes; someone will say or do something and a good 10 seconds or so will go by before the other party responds, characters frequently reminisce or stare off into the distance for an interminable amount of time, etc. This all becomes excruciating to bear with as the series plays out, and I frequently found myself begging for something/anything to happen, or for someone to do or say something, in order to get this show moving along at a more expedient pace. I understand this is supposed to be a \"slow burn\" dramatic tale, but that's no excuse for it to be a tedious and boring watch (which it often is).The premise of this revenge/love story is intriguing, but could they not think of a better way to implement it?...Essentially, this story involves a male lead character who wants to get revenge for his older brother's suicide (which he blames on the actress his older brother was in love with). Let's set aside the fact that any reasonable person would realize that this is not the fault of the actress, and just assume that the younger brother is filled with blind compassion and rage for his beloved brother. The only problem with this is that he hasn't seen his brother in over a decade, and he barely seems to know or care about him at all, so, it's rather unbelievable that he would be completely consumed with avenging him all of a sudden (despite how this show tries to explain to you why he is, via flashbacks to when they were younger).In order to exact his revenge, the lead character decides to get close to the actress by becoming her personal bodyguard. Why not just walk up to her and say \"Hi, I'm the younger brother of the guy you loved, and he's had a very bad accident, can we discuss the situation?\" He could have easily gotten close to her that way, instead of using this absurdly contrived bodyguard plot. Nevertheless, he somehow manages to become her bodyguard; I guess background checks were not a requirement, since the people who hired him have no problem with the fact that he has no experience, don't bother to make a simple inquiry to discover he was the brother of the guy they were trying to keep away from the actress, and don't seem to care that he's a violent and unstable psychopath who shakes down people on the street for money when he's not busy losing club fights on purpose. What, was Hannibal Lecter unavailable for the position?...Jeesh!There are a couple of secondary stories as well, the most prominent of which involves an heir of a major company wanting to marry the actress. This story line is absurd and unnecessary; the sole reason as to why these 2 characters should/must be married is essentially based on a single innocuous misunderstanding that could easily be rectified by reasonable adults...sadly, the writers are children and thought otherwise!As for your actors; there's basically only 2 main roles: Shin Min A plays the part of the actress. She's usually does pretty solid work, and she does what's asked of her here well enough, but this is not a role that does her any favors. Rain plays the lead here; he has legions of fans, but at the risk of being beaten to death by a bunch of fan-girls, I'm just going to say it: He's not that great of an actor, and I've been less than impressed with many of the roles I've seen him in. His range primarily consists of being angry, sad, distant, or goofy (with, seemingly, very little room in between). He's certainly good looking, athletic, likable, and, he can do a wide variety of things, but IMO, he's lacking the nuances and subtleties needed at this stage of his career (now 2012), in order to be considered the preeminent new wave actor that so many people once claimed him to be.This show wants to be an epic sad love tale meets revenge story, but it's not! Instead, it's an overwrought and underwhelming melodrama that features an unlikeable main lead and some badly contrived story lines. If it were 12-16 episodes long, and helmed by a more solid writing team, it could have been a lot better. Ultimately though, it never rises above the level of being just a mediocre soap opera at best.Bottom line: 5 out of 10 stars. If you are looking for a Korean melodrama of a similar vein, there are many other shows to choose from that are far better than this one.", "I had extremely high hopes for this series as it's Rain's newest work and since I have seen \"Full House\" and \"Sang Doo! Let's Go To School\" which I thought were outstanding, I didn't expect anything less - in fact I expected it to be a life changing thing! Haha. I was worried that I was going to be disappointed because I had such high hopes but it amazed me and managed to blow me away.Using non-verbal communication, you can tell from the cover that it's very serious, Rain's character is going to be very cold, and just from the title you know that the story is going to be exciting and epic.Even though it's not the first time this kind of story has been done, it still seems so original because it seemed so fresh.The thing I enjoyed the most was seeing a completely different side of Rain. If you're a Rain fan from such series as \"Full House\", don't expect to see the sweet and gentle Young-Jae you saw. Rain's character, Bok-Gu, is cold, UNBELIEVABLY smooth and has the attractive 'bad boy' attitude. After watching this, I was convinced that Rain can act any role because he just nailed this character. There is nothing worse than when you're watching a film or series and you don't care about the characters. You won't find that in this \u0096 you will genuinely care about the characters, pity them, hate them, understand them, be frustrated with them and fall in love with them.You also cannot ignore the incredible music used in this. The music alone touched me and broke my heart - it was so effective. A superb soundtrack.Girls must watch this series for the excitement of the development of the 2 lovers' relationship and see what ending will come out of this completely against fate scenario. And most importantly, in all seriousness, no joke, Rain's handsomeness. The shots used for all the characters were done so unbelievably well \u0096 I melted every time Rain came on screen.Guys \u0096 get ready for a new role model. There is also so much action in this \u0096 it's more than a drama. Also, follow all the courting steps in this series and you will melt any girl's heart you desire.All the cast's acting skills were generally extremely good but hands down to Rain who once again holds nothing back and always gives it his all.The ending is beautiful and at first you may find it very unsatisfying because you needed more closure but I was thinking about this series for days (along with tears \u0096 yes it was also very sad, heartbreaking and really touching) after I finished watching it and I found that I loved it more and more. It turns out to be such a brilliant story and it's a must see. Definitely another brilliant piece with Rain.", "Its been two days since I watched the ending and I still can't stop thinking about the it and being sad. Damn ending was really depressing. Especially after the excellent acting and character development made me really care and worry about the two lovers. Its quite rare that I actually care about the characters in these sort of dramas, but this one did the job. Never thought Rain was such a great actor.Story line was very engaging, even though not very original. I like the fact that none of the characters are \"evil\", rather they are all driven by their own sense of love, friendship, guilt or loyalty. Yet, the course of events and misunderstandings forced them into confrontation and emotional conflict. The road to ruin is paved with good intentions. Easily the best drama I've watched in years, but extremely heartbreaking. :(", "*WARNING* spoilers. To avoid them, but still read this otherwise un-spoiling review, skip down past the fourth paragraph down that begins with \"on the scale of originality\" and enjoy this review :) There are a few things to be said about this drama: First off - I won't lie, I only began watching this because I knew Rain was in it. And come on, lets face it - what girl isn't in love with Rain? lol. But after watching the first few episodes I realized just how incredibly deep and touching this drama really was.Aside from being good-looking, one has to give MAJOR credit to Bi - his acting is amazing in this drama, as it was in Sangdoo-ya Hakyo Kaja. It is hard to believe that this is only his third drama - he acts like a pro. His sad scenes moved me to tears, his romantic ones made me go \"awwww\" and be even more in love with him than I was (which is saying something) and his funny scenes (which were scarce in this drama, i have to admit, but still effective) had me burst out laughing. He displays many complex emotions throughout this drama - from violently angry to determined, stoic, grief-ridden, genuinely happy, and confused - all of which he shows with remarkable skill. All in all, Bi's acting as a lead truly helped this drama be amazing. One thing I was particularly impressed with is that he doesn't overact his sad scenes or force emotions that aren't there, as many novice actors tend to do (i.e. the fake, tearless cry) but rather pulls from memories of his own painful past to recreate the emotions the character should be feeling, giving way to a very genuine, touching performance of grief.The same can be said for Shin Min-Ah, whose innocence and smile light up this otherwise fairly depressing drama. The supporting cast does a very good job as well, and particular emphasis should be noted for Lee Ki Woo, who skillfully managed to turn his truly detestable character into a likable one in just 16 episodes.On the scale of originality it could definitely be higher. Anyone who is familiar with the writing of Lee Kyun Hee (who also wrote \"Sorry, I Love You\" and \"Let's Go, Sangdoo,\") knows that she generally follows the pattern of portraying a tragic love that is too strong to endure on this earth - Ijuksa, for the most part, is no different in that sense. And many typical Kdrama clich\u00e9s are implemented in this show, it's true. But different scenarios between characters and more complex relationships between them make a very tangled web of love that I, for one, have not ever seen the likes of yet. In short: you'll recognize some elements from other dramas, but you definitely won't be bored.Finally - the music. To put it simply, this drama's music is outstanding. Full of piano and vocal tracks whose melodies will embed themselves in your mind for days and not leave even if you want them to, and others that will make you tear up after the first chord, the soundtrack to Ijuksa is heartfelt and will bring back many memories while listening to it.All in all this drama is truly worth a watch. It's touching, romantic, and lovable.If you are looking for a cheery, light, fluffy drama, I wouldn't recommend this one, simply because it is very deep and tugs at ones heartstrings quite often. But by the end of this drama, I can guarantee that you will be sad to part with these characters, all of whom you undoubtedly will grow to love.Two thumbs up for Ijuksa. :D", "I won't give away the story most of the reviewers have told you the basic storyline. However, my spoiler is revolving around Bok-ku (Rain's character) and Da-jung (Sa-rang Kim) the reviewers are right this story is about Bokku wanting to get revenge on actress Cha Eun-suk for his brother's tragedy.However, as the story progressed I grew to dislike Bok-ku more and more. He moved between Da-jung who he claimed to love and his obsessed love of Cha Eun-suk. Da-Jung had been in a fire and I am not sure who saved who but she fell in love with Bok-ku. Throughout the story he continues to lead her on a path that suggests the two will be together that he will not be like his brother overwhelmed by Cha Eun-suk. There is nothing to hate about Cha Eun-suk her character isn't evil in any real way she just throws love around very easily. First with Bok-ku's brother (who she doesn't know why he disappeared on her) then suddenly to Bok-ku and when he asks about her previously love she answers it's been so long she can't remember.All the while Da-Jung has done the unspeakable for Bok-ku by using the photos they discovered of the real live relationship of his brother and Cha Eun-suk to blackmail the actress to pay for his brother's hospital care.I understand a lot of Asian movies, dramas, etc don't like to have neat clean happy endings but this one was just wrong.Da-Jung I felt sorry for although a close friend of theirs Mi-Suk is in love with her she never leads him on she tells him upfront she wants Bok-ku and no other. In the end she gives up to Cha Eun-suk because she knows Bok-ku will never look at her as anything he promised to. That part made me cry. After the two had gone out together and he called her his Da-Jung and how she was perfect for him and they together to be betrayed was just the wrong way to go with the story.I am writing this only because it truly bothered me. I know it's melodrama but geez have a bit of sympathy for the girl who has saw you through some of the worst times instead of rushing off with the same obsession your brother had.", "This is a strange story with some very dark themes. It starts of with the plot looking a little like Dangerous Liaisons but moves into different territory as it progresses.There are a few surprises as we go a long, there is a little humour and the lead actress is very beautiful.The acting is mostly good especially from the two leads, the actress playing Dajung is the weakest cast member and is often unconvincing.Unfortunately it does move into more melodrama as it progresses and becomes a bit to much like soap opera at times.They also should have ended it one episode earlier, everything was tied up and resolved and then they added an extra episode of very confused plot that tries to inject some pathos but instead comes across as very contrived.It was worth watching once but I can't imagine wanting to re-watch it.", "You have to hand it to the makers of Korean TV programs. They make so many, there's something to please (or disgust) everyone.You have your choice of standards - for example, HIGH - Green Rose (Geu-rin Ro-jeu) and My Name is Kim Samsoon (Nae Il-eum-eun Kim Sam-soon); MEDIUM - Full House (Poolha Wooseu), and Only You (On-li Yoo); and UTTER RUBBISH - like Princess Lulu (Loo-loo Gong-joo) and Sorry, I love you (Mianhada, Saranghanda). This 20 episode series swings between all three categories.The main plot is simple: a young man (Jung Ji-hoon aka Rain) is reunited with his older brother (Kim Yeong-jae) after a long separation. The older brother is so obsessed with a famous actress (Sin Min-ah), that he comes to serious grief over it. The younger brother blames her and swears to exact revenge. The problem is - and there is always a problem, or there'd be no drama - once he gets close enough to her to be in a position to hurt her, he too becomes obsessed with her.There is nothing really new in the plot, but the series works for two main reasons. Firstly, the three lead actors are outstanding, as indeed are most of the supporting cast, particularly Lee Ki-woo in a really unsympathetic and gormless role of suitor to Sin Min-ah's character.Secondly, there is the clever and interesting use of partial flashback. This means that only part of each event is told at any one time, and several flashbacks to the same event, told from different perspectives and with additional details, are required to give the full story - the past of each character is slowly fleshed out and secrets are revealed. What is the reason behind the panic attacks the actress often suffers on-set? Why is the older brother so obsessed with her that he throws his life away? Why is the younger brother so reckless and violent?There are several sub-plots, and character complexities are explored at length. Because the series is unusually long, you'll you need to pay a bit of attention to details for the story to make sense. This makes a very welcome and unexpected challenge from a series of this nature.It's also the biggest problem. Suspension of disbelief is a necessary part of any drama because (gasp) it's not real. By watching it, you partly agree to buy into the world that's being created for you. The difficulty is; can you do it over 20 episodes? When the twists and turns are stretched to maximum elasticity as they are here, and when there are inconsistencies and even a couple of errors of logic in the working out of plot points, you may stop caring who did what to whom and why, or what finally becomes of them all. But if you can stick it out for the long haul, there's a lot to be savoured and enjoyed, and maybe just a little to be tolerated.", "So. Here's a short analysis of the 'love attraction' that results from admiring a performer with incredibly strong appeal. What is it? Master writers, that's what I think. OK masters of each task. Writers, performers, producers, everyone.I watch Korean dramas for their absence of sexual activity. Helpful to express and process my romantic emotions. In fact, I'm really grateful to the 'moral police agency' of Korea. I never thought I'd say that of any such entity, but this time, such a rules-enforcer has been good for me.I've watched several K-dramas; usually difficult to realize as conceivable, but that is beside the point. Go with the plot and soon, watcher, you are drawn in, hook line sinker. I believe it is the show's ability and willingness to articulate feelings. Something this Irish German American was not taught. Thank you.So, again, I decide to watch another Bi Rain-featured show. I click on A Love To Kill. Figure some edgy/grittiness would wash away the romantic cuteness of Full House. Well all that was going well --fun! Our anti?hero is so self-centered, self-destructive. No matter that he absolutely has no skills to prevent this. I relish to indulge the self- fantasy. Not to mention the to-die-for cinematography of our man kick boxing in the ring. wwwwwow.Our Bokgu-la and his writers took me down a path that kicked me in the soul clear to kingdom come. At what point did I develop feelings for this character/real person? How is that possible? Ah social/ entertainment engineering. At what expense? What benefit? The pain of withdrawal is agony; no less than from a real person in real life. Attributed to this young man's meteoric success born from his real life circumstances, subsequent drive, and resulting skill? Yes, the Michael Jordan of Korean entertainment indeed. One must applaud him.The pain and sorrow of losing my vibrant, strong young hero is as totally unexpected as the path of the movie all along.

It has the brain (legal battles) and the brawn (physical fights) element, which is a promising combination if you are into action dramas. The promising plot and conflicts are able to keep the audience engaged through episodes, as they are intriguing enough. However, don't expect the fights to be that epic. There are twists, sure, but some are kind of predictable and forced. The twists are not the kind that could make you clap of awe. Then, as expected from Korean dramas, there is the romantic element. I was worried at first that this would ruin the cool prompt, but luckily, it doesn't, as it only serves as an additional sentimental watching experience. However, one thing does bother me: a clich\u00e9 couple conflict. The female lead character is at odd with the male lead, just because he keeps her in the dark for her own sake, while she instantly jumps into conclusion without considering other reasons behind his action. I'm sorry, but this is just too dumb for a so-called lawyer, who is supposedly used to facts and logic. I also notice some details that don't add up, such as the female lead's inability to recognize her own mother when the mother is literally portrayed by the same actress with the only difference is the hair. Sure, the female lead was only a child when the mother left her, but there's a family picture in her father's photo studio, for God's sake! It's just too illogical, let alone since the female lead has always been longing for her mother, which normally would make her keep record of her mother's face. On top of the minor annoyance, the ending is not as epic as expected. It's all resolved just like that, making me question, \"That's it? Just like that?!\"\nThis drama is cool, honestly, but it doesn't last long, let alone until the very end. I think this could be mind-blowing drama if the conflicts are prepared better.

This film is the perfect mix of comedy, drama, romance, some of the best storytelling I've ever seen, and even some surprise action scenes! And what's best, it's universal. I'm sure some would avoid this film simply because it's Korean - but that's where you'd make a mistake.This film makes sense to anyone who's a teenager or has been one (recently.) Both college students, the clumsy, laid back Gyeon-woo and \"The Girl\", a whimsical tomcat, make for one interesting couple for the main characters. And everything that they encounter throughout the film magically comes together in the end, and it's truly heartwarming. You'll laugh, you'll cry, no matter who you are. I guarantee it. It couldn't be any better!", "*SPOILERS AHEAD*...taken from a reaction paper I wrote for Social Science Class..My Sassy Girl is a 2001 film by Korean director Kwak Jae Yong, formerly known for the straight melodramas he directed. It was based on the novel with the same title, compiled from the journals posted on the Internet by Kim Ho Seok about his relationship with a girl. The film catapulted its lead actress Jeon Ji Hyun and its lead actor Cha Tae Hyun into superstardom. It spawned viewers' interest in romantic comedies, although it was never recognized in the west.My Sassy Girl starts out with Gyeon-Woo, a na\u00efve but eccentric 25 year-old college student who doesn't have a clear direction in life. He narrates how his parents raised him like a girl, and how his parents' constantly telling him he was smart caused him to become lazy. His life then becomes intertwined with that of a bizarre girl whom he meets at the subway. She was drunk and wasted when he first saw her, and before passing out at the subway she calls him 'honey'. He was then forced to take responsibility for her, and that night he carried the wasted girl on her back all the way to a nearby motel. Hilarity ensues in the following scenes, as Gyeon-Woo and the girl share funny moments together, such as hitting each other on the subway, playing squash (the ball always hitting Gyeon-Woo squarely in the face), dancing in the disco with their high school uniforms on, and exchanging shoes (the girl wears sneakers while Gyeon-Woo wears heels).The early parts of the film showcase the girl's bizarre attitude. The girl can be seen arguing with strangers, writing synopses of action movies, passing out after drinking three glasses of beer, and hitting Gyeon-Woo all the time, telling him 'wanna die?' and using him to get her way. Gyeon-Woo, on the other hand, succumbs to all the girl's whims and does everything for her. The first half of the film is filled with pure physical comedy and witty, hilarious sequences.What sets this movie apart from others is how the second half of the film, which consists of pure melodrama, is connected to the first half. The second half explains the girl's bizarre attitude and unfolds all the drama behind the girl's comedic behavior in the first half. Gyeon-Woo battles a conflict with himself and finds it hard to let the girl go after 'healing her sorrow'. The latter scenes in the film are so dramatic that it 'turns grown men into crybabies' (quoted from the International Movie Database). Jeon Ji-Hyun's acting versatility added to the second half's strong impact on the viewers. A very ingeniously written script turns the laughing audience into a crying one in a short span of time.However sad the second half of the film may be, the 'overtime' part of the film wonderfully concludes all the comedy and drama that unfolded in the preceding two parts. Gyeon-woo and the girl go along with the sad fate that befell them, continuing their own lives. The ending (which I will not reveal, for I recommend that people watch it) could be considered as one of the greatest ones in the history of film-making. It left no questions unanswered, and it concluded all the subtle hints that the earlier parts gave. It left me, and other members of the audience, laughing in tears.The uncut version of the film lasts 137 minutes (2 hours and 17 minutes), quite long for a romantic comedy. But it was so craftily and carefully written that one would not notice time ticking by. Every scene in the film gives the viewers something to laugh, cry, or think about. There was no dead air in the story. The cinematography of the film was excellent, for it captured every scene perfectly, also showcasing the beautiful environment of Korea along the way. The soundtrack very much added to the emotion of the film's most significant sequences. George Winston's rendition of 'Pachelbel's Canon in D' invokes a very romantic and joyous feeling that is indeed felt in the scene where Gyeon-Woo gives the girl a rose during her class (at an all-girls school) while she was playing the piano. Shin Seung Hoon's 'I Believe', the movie's main theme, served its function well as the tear-inducer in the most dramatic parts of the film. After watching the movie, only hearing the song brings me to the edge of tears as I remember the saddest parts of the film.Jeon Ji-Hyun's acting in the film was very superior. She does very well in portraying the unnamed girl (yes, the girl's name was never mentioned) in the movie. Her very strong charm and acting versatility (she laughs, threatens Gyeon-Woo, and cries in one scene) makes the film very appealing, even to grown men who grew up watching action movies. Her performance in this film shoved her into the limelight and made girls want to be like her and made boys want to be with her.Cha Tae Hyun did justice to the role of Gyeon-Woo. Just looking at him makes you laugh, and his being punched, slapped and manipulated by the girl is one of the big factors in the film's success as a comedy. His performance in the film made him one of Korea's 'most wanted dates', according to a survey on Korean girls.Some of the very notable characteristics that I found in the film were: 1.) It had no kissing scenes; 2.) The girl's name was never mentioned, although she played the biggest part in the film, and 3.) There were no 'I love you' lines in the entirety of the film.After watching the uncut version of the film, I saw tears in the eyes of most people in the audience. I could most probably say the movie has been successful in moving its viewers.Jeon Ji Hyun won the 2002 Grand Bell Best Actress Award for her performance in this film. Cha Tae Hyun won Best New Actor at the 2002 Korean Oscars for his performance in this film. My Sassy Girl was number one at the box office for six straight weeks in Korea and sold over 20,000 tickets per day in Hong Kong at the time of its release in 2001. It was the second highest grosser of that year (accumulating more box office loot than SHREK, HARRY POTTER or LORD OF THE RINGS). It was the Best Asian Film at the 22nd Annual Hong Kong Film Awards. Just this year, Dreamworks (an American film company) has been planning for a Hollywood remake of this film. How great could this film get? My Sassy Girl is a film close to my heart. It is not only a lighthearted comedy that delves into the culture and behavior of Asian teenagers. This movie shows that there are so many different ways of expressing your love without saying 'I love you'. It is a movie that proves 'fate is building a bridge of chance for the one you love'.", "This is my \u0084afterword\" \u0096 maybe it's written more for myself, but please don't mind it and my lack in English too.When watching movies we rarely know what to wait from them and the least we wait the film to affect us so hard that suddenly a completely new dimension appears to us, that the movie will make us to look on things and life from a different viewpoint, will make you to remember forgotten things. But movies like that exist, and this is one of them .Thinking about this film I start to consider what the movie makers really want to achieve creating films and what is the task for a movie. Is it a picture movie with good cameraman's work, good acting , story or impressive special effects? These things are important ,but in my opinion, in a good movie the main is the message of it. I don't know if it is the director, the scriptwriter or the crew together who made this movie to touch the viewer, made him to look with a different look, who worked to make this film to deliver the message as it is, but I can say that they have achieved their aim.This movie is humane. It's message and characters are humane. It has no meaning if the end of the movie is happy or sad - there is joy and pain both in it, because that's exactly how the life is.I liked this movie. But it is impossible for me to rate it the same it's not possible for me to rate my own life.This movie touched me. I hope that many others too.", "-Minor Spoilers-This film is one of the greatest Romance/Comedy movies ever made, and as such, I feel I will have a hard time doing it justice with a few lines written here. The story was first seen online as an internet diary written by Korean student Ho Sik Kim. And is claimed to be based on a relationship with a girl he actually met. Yeah, that's right. It's a (mostly) true story! Then the story was bought by Korean film production company, Shin Cine. Finally, Korean director, Kwak Jae Yong, 'Sketch of a rainy day' was brought on board to direct. The rest, as they say. is history.The entire movie revolves around two main characters, 'Kyun Woo' (Cha Tae Hyun) and 'The Girl' (Yes, her name is never actually given) played by the wonderful Jeon Ji Hyun. The story begins when Kyun Woo meets the girl on a train platform late at night. See, she's drunk. Very drunk. After making a fool of herself on the train she passes out, but not before calling Kyun Woo \"Honey\". This leads the other passengers to believe that she is his girlfriend. In turn, our wimpy hero feels obliged to take care of her. So off he goes. Well, at least half way down the platform, before dropping her onto an empty bench. But do you think he has the heart to leave her there? Of course not. That's one of the things that makes this film special. Kyun Woo may be a bit soft. He may be even just a tad pathetic, but his heart is in the right place. All he wants to do is help the girl. But... What does he get in return? Well, He gets a down right scary, weird, psychopath of a girlfriend who takes every opportunity to either A: Hit him B: Humiliate him or C: Get him thrown into Jail. Yes, she's pretty mean. Or is she? Is there more to her than both Kyun Woo, and we the audience, can see? Maybe his wish to help her is not totally unjustified.One of the greatest achievements of this movie is in it's two leads. Considering nearly the entire movie focuses on just two people. The stars did a very good job of keeping up 'very' good chemistry. These are two wonderful actors who portray all the emotions needed, and at a very high level. Cha Tae Hyun, in his first role manages to keep Kyun Woo on just the right side of Bumbling, Shy and even Pathetic. At no point in the movie does he annoy, and that's a hard task indeed. He's always laughable. Granted, sometimes you laugh with him, mostly we laugh 'At him,' but that never stops you from thinking you'd like to have him as your friend. Jeon Ji Hyun however, is just incredible. She is the best actress of her generation. I don't just mean in Korea. I mean PERIOD. She fills the character of 'the girl' with depth, charm and overall a sense of reality which in a film that occasionally becomes far fetched is an excellent achievement indeed. She is incredibly expressive. Most of the time she doesn't even need to say anything. Her face says all we need to know. Some of her expressions are just priceless, and I can honestly say I have never, ever seen them captured on film before. i'd be 'more' than a little surprised if she doesn't become more of an 'international' star in the next few yearsThe film features a wide range of genre's. Although It is primarily a Romance/Comedy film, it also has a dash of action courtesy of the girl's 'Scriptwriting' hobby. This leads to all manor of imagined scenarios staring Jeon Ji Hyun. Be it parodies of 'The Matrix' in her 'Demolition Terminator' story, to an 'Ashes Of Time' style period/swordplay movie later on in the film. These scenes, while not exactly furthering the plot are really well done, and a nice little break from the main story.My favourite aspect of the film is how the director gives little hints and tips as to what is happening in the story without actually telling us. Each and every small detail (Which at first may seem trivial or pointless) will come back to play a major part in the film later on. Apart from being a really neat little way to tell the story, it also makes the film nearly infinitely re-watchable. You can come back to it again and again and you'll always notice something new which enhances the plot. By the time you get to the midpoint of this film you 'will' care for these characters. As it approaches a more touching, less comedic, romance angle you wont lose interest. It's clever, funny, touching and romantic.The only people who may not like this will be those allergic to romantic films. Even then, I feel you may just be surprised. I cannot recommend this film enough. If you don't watch it. You only have yourself to blame.", "My sassy girl is a movie kind of old indeed, I have it since it went out on DVD, because every movie I hear good comments I buy it, but honestly I didn't see this movie until yesterday, I saw the directors cut which is 15 minutes longer, so the movies reaches 2 hour 15 minutes, and there wasn't a single minute that I got bore, the movie is the perfect mix of comedy and romance, the comedy part doesn't seems to happen because of forced situations, they are more like things that could happen to your or me. The movie is son engaging that I saw it yesterday and I cant stop thinking about it, honestly I'll see it tomorrow again with some friends, because people usually do not like to watch foreign movies thinking that only Hollywood makes good movies (and that is such a mistake).The actors are cool, honestly in the beginning of the movie I tough common these 2 are the stars? but then you realize they are perfect, casue they seems to be 2 normal everyday people, not HOT STARS with perfects bodys (I ended loving that girl), the chemistry is perfect, the two of them blends together so nice that I could believe that everything that happens on the screen is real.The Score, WOW, I already had to buy it, the music was like I was playing some Final Fantasy game, That means that every music you hear fits perfectly to the scene.My only concern is the remake Dreamworks is doing, that scare me, doing a movie again just cause Americans don't like to watch movies with Asian people? bad very bad, I feel sorrow for them, I am glad I don't have that problem and I can watch this movie the way it was envisioned.One advice: WATCH IT NOW!!!10/10", "This movie shot right to the top of my favorites of all time, at first I where a little uncertain about if I would enjoy a Korean movie, but it put all my expectations to shame and I where captivated through the entire movie. The next day I had to call my close friend and get her over to watch it too.I've since seen it numerous time, both alone and with friends and I have yet to find a person who did not enjoy it as much as me. I only wish I could have never seen it and experience watching it for the first time again.I really can't recommend this movie highly enough and in my opinion it truly belongs on the IMDb top 250 list.", "This is one of those movies that makes you think about it for hours after you have seen it(whether the first or the fifth time). The reason being that it is funny, witty and enthralling while still maintaining the charisma of a great Korean romantic movie.You will undoubtedly hate Ji-Hyun Jun for the better half of the film but by the end, she will be one of the most enchanting woman you ever saw (Besides Audrey Hepburn off-course). Tae-Hyun Cha plays the role of a difident sort nice guy but with good acting and sound expressions.Overall, I would give this a 10/10. Don't forget to read the book though, its a lot funnier and accurate.Thank you", "I can say nothing short of a classic about this movie. My friend recommended this movie who said it was pretty cute. I never really saw a Korean movie but I was interested. I was hooked form the start with the unique style of story telling. I have to admit it that I hate the voices especially the girl. But after half an hour I just forgot it and just sank into this wonderful story.The first half is full of funny scenes(especially the abortion lie).I would just hate the girl for giving the poor, sensitive hero a hard time. Throughout there are subtle hints about her complex character. Both the actors have done exceptionally well but the main attraction is the plot.The soldier in the park scene was a little unnecessary,although I think it helps unravel the girl's strange character. From the second half onwards I start to understand more about the girl and by the end I just loved her amazing spirit. The story unfolds the reasons for her bossy behaviour. At the same time the relationship between them matures. The train scene with the line on the floor was really funny. Towards the end the scenes moves towards pure melodrama - and its been done really nice. The hill top scene was heartbreaking and the \"ten rules\" was beautiful. I liked the train scene which was funny and moving at the same time. The overtime ties back any broken threads in the story and the sad story of her life is finally revealed.The ending, in my opinion was one of the best ever, which makes you go over the whole movie in your head at that instant. A few pointers of the style of \"Serendipity\". The Hero is funny and nicely portrays the innocent and kind hearted Gweon-Woo. The beautiful Ji-hyun Jun as the bossy I-am-so-special girl is a nice choice.The main thing I like is that it is not an American romance type movie. I don't really like the American type romance which is focused around sex and complex issues.(Though \"Titanic\" and \"You have got mail\" are my favourites). The background score was also top notch. Especially \"I believe\". The only criticism that can be made is that some of the jokes were vulgar. Otherwise it would be a great family movie. I feel kind of embarrassed watching this in front of my family.A few things which was peculiar about this movie were 1. The girl's name is never mentioned 2. They never kiss On the whole I cannot rate it below 10 by any means. A must-see for any one who loves Romantic movies and every one else TOO!!", "The attention to detail, the depth and width of the plot is amazing.  The movie is so good that it provide good entertainment to many audience.I cannot grasp all of it till I saw it the second time.  There are several plots in the movie.  I am learning more about the movie when I am writing this.It's NOT only a love story of how 2 people with contrasting personality fall in love; it may give that impression to some people.  It's NOT a normal dumb boy chase beautiful girl flick.STOP READING and see the movie again if you really think this movie is just a romantic flick with funny jokes.  You will enjoy it more.SUPER SPOILER ---------------------The Character: The girl always think she is special (she say that explicitly when she is crying at the hillside), and which beautiful girl doesn't? Or at least everyone else wish to?   She is very self-centered, proud, witty (remember how quick she get Gyun-Woo out of class?), talented (kendo, piano, squash, dance), not afraid of how people look at her, live in a quite well off family etc.The director has to stress that Gyun-Woo is smart (from their parents) because viewer may not really notice that if they don't really observe.  He is a sensitive person, probably due to his girlish upbringing.Gyun-Woo is quite layback, and yet to determine what he desire or want in life in the beginning.  And that's one of the reason the girl said, 'I have met the boy from the future' at the ending.  For the first 3 years they meet, they are not really ready for each other, due her ex-boyfriend (exbf) and personality.  They are at the crossroad, so they eventually have to split.The Story: In the subway, Gyun-Woo gets the girl's attention immediately since he looks like her ex-boyfriend.  She may actually intentionally grasp his attention by vomiting etc.  Then she announces to the public right away that he is her 'Sweet heart', so he have no option but to take care of her.  As a proof of Gyun-Woo getting her attention is that, she scold at the youngster who wears pink.  She thinks he is special and no one else should wear the same color for the one she thinks special.  This point can verified again in the park which the guy who smokes and wear the same blue-colored sweater. She knows she is beautiful and clothing matter a lot for her or those she cares.It is quite deceiving that most viewer will initially think that only Gyun-Woo is attracted by the girl and a normal boy chase girl story starts. But it's not.  They both are attracted to each other at their first sight.To call Gyun-Woo 'sweet heart' may come from her subconscious.  It is so important to her to understand herself that she need to confirm with Gyun-Woo that she indeed think Gyun-Woo has so much resemblance with her exbf.  So she phoned Gyun-Woo to come out for the 1st time.  (Phone number probably obtained during their stay at the police station)After Gyun-Woo left the girl on a bench, he forget the girl's handbag and he have to return it a few steps later.   Later, he forget her handbag again in the rain. This time leads him to visit the girl's home for the first time. We can see that every detail is well layout, intentional in this movie.First time I see the movie, I was distracted by my laughing, but now I know the reason why police rush up to the motel.  The phone call is made by the girl's parent.  That's one of the reasons why her parents' are not approved of him.  And they know it's all lie when he try explaining why the motel's lighter is in his pocket.(Is there any meaning for the kids to all suddenly gone when they are in the coffees shop?  And why does the coffee come so late?) (Why does the girl slap Gyun-Woo so often? Is there any meaning behind?)The Girl always tries to be different.  She doesn't like people dress alike; she doesn't like those people ordering the same golbangee (beef stew) in the restaurant.Why are they using the same motel room the second night? On the first night the innkeeper says there no room left from 1st to 3rd floor, so on the second night the same thing happened coincidentally; all other rooms are occupied.Do your recognize in her first script Gyun-Woo asks why don't they kiss at the end?  He is actually talking about why they do not kiss in this movie. Then the girl (director) says that this script (movie) is not a melodrama. (Then, how come this movie is a action movie?)Also, the first script prophesize the girl saving Gyun-Woo in the playground later.For the second script, I will talk about that later.The reason why she pushes Gyun-Woo into the water is she wants Gyun-Woo in the water too. She wants Gyun-Woo in some way connected to her exbf too. Her exbf drowned, implied when the girl staring at a pier with the ex-bf's mother later.  Assuming that she don't know whether Gyun-Woo can swim or not, the girl is confident that she can rescue him OR she hope this boy will not just leave her, by a simple drowning accident.  The story did not tell how her ex-bf drowned, whether the girl is present or not.  But if the girl was at the scene at the accident, that means she have learnt lifegaurding after he died (which I biasedly assume).  Nevertheless, the girl found peace of mind/satisfaction that she knows if she is together with any boy, the boy will not be drowned.  She wants to try and confirm that with this boy.In the playground's 'Ghost House', the girl say the pain one suffered from being dumped will be gone quicker than one can imagine.  But it looks like it is contrary to her own behavior.  So, why she said that?  Actually the girl is not just grieving for the death of her exbf at this stage. She is also guilty, angry with herself on not loving her ex-bf as much any more. Or at least, she is struggling with try keep loving him or kicks him out of her mind/present life.  Rationally, she knows this is the thing to do, to face it, to leave away from the ghost of his exbf.  However, she is not as 'special' as she would like, that she still long for him, since she is attracted to Gyun-Woo the first time they met.The soldier claimed the guardhouse sergeant looks like Gyun-Woo.  Who else look like Gyun-Woo?  He should be the ex-bf.  The director maybe even hinting that he is not that good to the Girl, although the girl never know this.  Well, I may be stretching that a bit here, but considered so many detail in this movie have an explanation, I won't be surprised if this is what the director meant.When the girl is saving Gyun-Woo under gunpoint, she cried.  She is actually talking to herself this time.  She think that her dead ex-bf want her to live well.  She says if she needs to learn what love is, she need to live well.  To live well, love is essential, but this is what a dead man cannot give her.  This is her struggle.At the end of the playground scene Gyun-Woo say what had happened is as if what he have planned.  He intends to understand the girl better at her birthday. At this stage all he know is the girl is devastated from a breakup, but not much else. Under such a stressful circumstances, the answer she give on how she view about her pain, view of good life/love must be authentic.  It's something hard to achieve by a normal date on this girl. Although the means is not what he expected, the ends is.    And the last slap on his face is always good.  It means she cares.Part 2 *****Gyun-Woo noticed somehow notice the girl in the restaurant.  Then Gyun-Woo goes back alone and asks around about this picture because Gyun-Woo will not ask that when the girl is around. Gyun-Woo want to understand her pain, try solving it.  The girl bring Gyun-Woo there a lot.  By now, Gyun-Woo is really a replacement for his exbf, and he knows. He tries to be nice and smile.  And Gyun-Woo said that she pretends to be happy every time (in this restaurant), because he knows she has lots of memory/history with her exbf in this restaurant.  And she comes back with him often.Not too sure why the bad guy in the 3rd script is called Gyun-Woo, and why she have to kill him?  If the director really meant the bad guy = her exbf (because they are look-alike and the director don't want to give a name to her exbf), it means the girl try forget him.  And interestingly the girl comes from future, so the director may think she can only forget him some time in future?After the script, she says 'Someday, I'll meet someone from the future'. Actually, it means 'Today, she meet someone (important to her= Gyun-Woo) that will be suitable for her in the future'.   Then Gyun-Woo says, 'if you do, ask him to take you; if it's possible!'  Gyun-Woo is urging her to let himself to take her!   Gyun-Woo looks very serious at this moment.  This is not a joke of 'You, sassy girl, let someone come from a UFO/future kidnap you!'After the 3rd script, they always ride subway together, play squash, phone each other every night, and wait for Gyun-Woo at school etc.  The girl really starts to love him, ever since Gyun-Woo chase her on high heel.  The longer he runs, the longer she loves him.  She remains jubilant that night. Even in the rain,  she is even nice enough to him, to run back home for an umbrella.  Each day, she likes Gyun-Woo more and more.Their parent controls her too much. (Party) because she love them too, she refrain herself from seeing Gyun-Woo/have to dealt directly with her parents about this.  So, Gyun-Woo doesn't have any news from her for a long time until their 100th day when their parent give her pressure.In the taxi, Gyun-Woo wonders if she still needs him as her exbf's replacement.  He tries to heal her pain, but he thinks the irony is that once the pain is gone, she no longer needs him.  He is well aware that the 'action'/'power' is always initiated from her.  But just for this moment, it does not matter; he enjoys every moment with her.  He ask the taxi driver to let them stay together longer.Maybe what Gyun-Woo think is correct, she doesn't need him anymore. That's why once her parent again pressured her this time; they don't meet each other for such a long time that Gyun-Woo think they are over.  So it's not too surprising for Gyun-Woo to go to a blind date.The condom and blind date joke is really funny, though gross.This time, the girl has a blind date.  She definitely is not the one who arrange it, her controlling parents do.  She call Gyun-Woo for help, Gyun-Woo is her 'friend'.  She has to call and give Gyun-Woo a chance here, since this time her blind date is quite nice.Ah... the 10 rules are very moving.  Gyun-Woo must be very sad when he left the restaurant.  He gives up on her.  He is giving his final blessing to them.The girl finally realizes that she did not recognize how deep he loves her. He deserve much more than a replacement or 'friend'. Everything she did want Gyun-Woo do for her is simply the way she try to find her exbf in Gyun-Woo. Gyun-Woo is not necessary Gyun-Woo in her mind at those important moments. She thought she just enjoy reliving it.  But after the 10 rules, she can no longer deny Gyun-Woo is the one who makes her happy, not the ghosts of her exbf.Before they try kissing, Gyun-Woo said they are on a crossroad since she had always regarded Gyun-Woo as painkiller.  But now she knows that she feel guilty for him and it's time for her to take action, to accept Gyun-Woo as 'another' important person in her life.  Gyun-Woo has already done all he can at this stage.But for the Girl to look at Gyun-Woo is painful.  He reminds her of his ex-bf, every time.  They look and seem to act alike.  She has to completely remove her ex-bf (first love, I believe)'s image before she can really love Gyun-Woo.  But she feels guilty to try removing her exbf from her mind, at the same time.When Gyun-Woo is writing the letter, saying he want to be serious with her. But even though he doesn't know exactly what she's thinking, he is sensitive enough to think this letter is for their split up.At the mountain, she express that her ex-bf is still very well within her. She hopes she is different, she hope she have the will to overcome, but no, she is still helpless.  She cannot avoid thinking of her ex-bf when seeing Gyun-Woo.  She is sorry, for that.They have to split; Gyun-Woo's presence is too disturbing for her to forget. She gives herself 2 years.  She goes away for Gyun-Woo.  Gyun-Woo tries to grow up and his life in these 2 years just devoted to her; he even tried and succeeds fulfilling her dream. No more blind dates, he is committed.The way they pile up the stones (and how Gyun-Woo remove it), one-by-one instead of bushing them away is quite a display sensitivenessOvertime ***** It's quite too late to explain clearly the drowning of her exbf now.  It makes lots of audience miss why her grievance is so deep.  And may not understand some finer points of the movie.Now we know why the girl ask about the handkerchief when Gyun-Woo is with the girl was crying at the 2nd restaurant.  A handkerchief has a very special meaning for her.  This was how her exbf meet her.She says 'While I was dating you, I met his mother OFTEN, she wanted to introduce a nice men to me, BUT I couldn't' Simply means she is still love her exbf very much at that time.  Also, it's quite funny that she thinks her exbf wants to introduce Gyun-Woo to her, when Gyun-Woo is hanging out with her.She wants to put this letter into a time capsule because it is too cruel so tell Gyun-Woo all this right away.  And she does believe she will overcome her mental barrier in 2 year.  However she cannot. It takes her 3 years.What the old man says to her is important; he makes her know that Gyun-Woo is still very much in love with her.  Time means nothing to him, just for her (NB. This is what the theme song about)The girl called Gyun-Woo's phone but the number has been changed.  She cried. Wondered if they ever met again, when she is ready for him now, after 3 years.  Not too sure if they'd ever meet by chance again.  Then she smiled.  But why she smiles?  Maybe she has just remembered how Gyun-Woo pretended the voice message long time ago?  Or have her just lost hope and grin bitterly?  The tiny touches let audience imagines, and could as well be the ending at this point.Can they meet by chance?  Very often fate only give you 1 chance.  Once you lose it, you lose it.  Gyun-Woo must be very upset when he misses her this time in the subway.Maybe due to coincidence, they finally met each other at her exbf's mom's lunch.Then she said, 'I think I met a man from the future, from your (Gyun-Woo)'s future.'  Do you recall all 1st and 3d script tells a story of girl coming from future helps Gyun-Woo or everyone else?  But this time, she meant instead of the girl coming from future, it is the boy coming from future that saves her.The best part of the movie is that it can be viewed from many angles.  Many subplots.. ---------------------------------------The Platform plot: ------------------ After the 10 rules, Gyun-Woo stands on the verge of subway platform (as seen on the surveillance camera). Is he trying to feel her pain of the breakup that she experienced with her exbf when she stood there? Was she really trying to kill herself at that time?  He wants to understand this feeling. Or simply just want to remember how they first met.  Then, He must be really happily running when he hear her voice form the broadcast.At the end of movie, when she stands on the platform edge again, we only saw her feet.  But what's really on her mind?  Is she expecting Gyun-Woo will pull her back again this time?  Now they have lost contact, will coincidence let them meet again?  Or is she simply enjoying the thought of how they first meet?  Nevertheless the subway come, she has to reluctantly drag her feet back, behind the yellow line.The edge of the platform is a crossroad of their fate.  This is the place she is going to suicide, where they met, where they miss each other, where travel together and getting to like each other etc.The Science Fiction Plot: ------------------ At the girl's third script, she mentioned explicitly the science fiction Plot of this movie, UFO = time machine.  Then she prophesize Gyun-Woo will like to travel back in time, the old-aged Gyun-Woo.  She said 'people from the future could be here now'Why don't they travel together?  Did the girl left Gyun-Woo/died before the invention of time machine?  Well, this is a story not being told. However, it is hinted that it's quite likely that the girl go back and make fun of him with the toad in the time capsule.  How about the head hitting squash? Another naughty joke from future?In her letter in the time capsule, she feels that Gyun-Woo 'live in the future' and she 'live in the past'From the look of the old man under the tree, do you think he is expecting her to visit the tree?  Don't you think it's quite rude for him to stare at her?  Yet the old man's answer is honest enough, because she is beautiful. The old man always says that because he is the old Gyun-Woo.  And of course he read the letters.What is his secret of the tree? Gyun-Woo cannot really replace a tree.  But with the help of the old Gyun-Woo, he can. This is a secret because the old Gyun-Woo only wants to share this between him and her! No one else! He say 'Fate is building a bridge of chance for someone you love' because he is help building this bridge for themselves.When she lookup after reading Gyun-Woo's letter, a UFO passes by; even with sound effect.The old Gyun-Woo was there inside the train when they met.At the end, she said 'I think I met a man from the future, from your (Gyun-Woo)'s future'.  This is literally what has happened.The Girl's second script ------------------ For the 2nd time I see this movie, I cannot fully grasp this script.  But now I can. Actually the girl is committing suicide when they first met.  She know she get drunk easily, it easier to do it that way.  She wants to die at the 1st year anniversary of her exbf's death.  This is why in her 2nd script the 'unlucky' boy should be buried alive, which simply meant lovers should better die together.  Do you think that the girl looks more like a ghost than a drunken woman at the platform?  It's quite a drastic look for lead actress in movie that supposed to be a comedy (at least at the beginning). The vomit after that is very good. It makes the audience forget her awful look, or forget to wonder if she is commiting suicide.  But isn't that quite crazy for anyone to vomit onto someone.  We all know that she is drunk but is still quite aware of her action.  But naturally, she doesn't really care since she planned to kill herself anyway!  The girl is not as sassy as most people perceived.  But she's pretty unruly anyway.When dating with Gyun-Woo, she always has to struggle with her guilt to her exbf, since her exbf have done nothing wrong to her.  He have no choice, he have to leave her.  For her, to accept a person that is in many ways resembles her exbf as another individual, is a especially difficult task. Her life can be much easier if she choose that nice guy at her blind date (or any other guy); but she knows Gyun Woo is her right choice however difficult this choice is.The Theme of the story is: Fate vs. Coincidence ------------------ Tons of coincidence happened here: Gyun-Woo is a look-alike, know the exbf's mother, is that coincidence? How coincidence is that the one girl you pick randomly on the street is the Girl? The birthday of the Girl and the soldier is the same; Blind date at the same night; the handkerchief, which is the first favor of both her ex-bf and Gyun-Woo give, is greenish; they both first met in subway; they have meet all of the 5 twins, without them recognizing....At the end of movie, Gyun-Woo asked, 'Is that coincidence?'  This is the question the director is asking the audience what is fate and what is pure coincidence.  Director's view of Fate is it happens only when one build/desire of it.  He demonstrate that by putting lots of coincidence in the movie, while let both characters work hard for/build up their good ending, which many people will regard that as fate.\nExamples of building chances: The old Gyun-Woo is help building his own fate under the tree by voicing the young Gyun-Woo's effort.  And during the 3 years separation they are building a bridge for each other on their own, by making themselves available for each other.  If the girl still cannot get out of her exbf's entangle, there is no point of meeting again.  And now Gyn-Woo seems to find a direction of his life on writing script.Lastly, have her exbf also bridge a bridge for the one he loved?  Gyun-Woo and the girl met on the 1st year of his death anivesary.  And the girl actually thinks her exbf want to introduce Gyun-Woo to her.  Maybe a supernatural plot is included here too! ;) Have her exbf arranged their final meeting by his mom etc?  Even Gyun-Woo does not considered himself look like his cousin (but the girl, her ex-bf, his mom does)By the director's definition, it is their fate to be together eventually.", "'Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo' (a.k.a. 'My Sassy Girl') is one of the most unconventional love stories I have witnessed in recent cinema. The storytelling is of the most sincere. There's no pretension. The comedy, drama and romance are very well balanced. There is no sex, not even a kiss, no one says 'I love you' and yet it turns out to be one of the most 'romantic' cinematic experience.'Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo' moves at a smooth pace. Jae-young Kwak's screenplay and direction are fantastic. The dialogues are smart and the characters are richly developed and unique. The female protagonist's character remains enigmatic right until the end. Her name isn't even mentioned during the entire film. We see everything from Gyun-woo's point of view and Jae-young Kwak gives detailed insight of the characters and their relationships. There are so many beautiful moments in the film but I won't give out any spoilers. In addition, with the use of a lovely gentle soundtrack and cinematography, he beautifully demonstrates the wonderful locations. Even though I loved the way the Korean culture was portrayed, the story is pretty universal.Newcomer Tae-hyun Cha leads the entire film. His performance is completely natural that it doesn't even feel that he was acting, let alone the fact that he was only new to films. His expressions, spontaneity, reactions and chemistry with co-stars are spot on. He is superb with the comedy and subtle in the dramatic scenes. Gianna Jun holds her own and does a fine job.Overall, 'Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo' is a very well crafted film. It's a heartwarming poetic romantic adventure from start to finish. I know this sounds a bit corny but I'll say that it's a film that's close to my heart.", "I heard that there will be a remake of My Sassy Girl, so as my subject say, GO WATCH IT NOW! This movie is so beautiful! The actors are brilliantly acted very well. The story is just plain, simple, it is my all time favorite movie! My sassy Girl is almost a perfect film, so I have no question why everyone who watched it, they liked it. My sassy girl is a classic, no not even it's co-Asian countries will remake or retain the power of this movie. This film is what you called \"Exclusively for Koreans\" so Hollywood, live this movie alone OK! But still, WATCH IT NOW! BEFORE Hollywood POISON THIS FILM!10/10", "Three years ago I was at a friends place, we couldn't figure out what to do so she \"forced\" me to watch \"My sassy girl\". From the look of the DVD cover I knew this was something I would not enjoy, the picture projected a film made of teen pop Hollywood garbage.I reluctantly agreed to watch it for a while but I became interested after about 15 minutes. The first half I thought was pretty good, until I realized there was still a second half to this. The second half seemed to drag on and I was praying for it to end. The overtime made me frustrated because I thought this was becoming less of a movie and more of a TV series (in terms of length). And than it was over and I realized what an amazing film this was.To keep this short I will tell you that I have directly \"forced\" about one hundred people to watch this film. The largest group I forced to watch \"My sassy girl\" occurred during two canceled lectures, students were sitting there bored so I popped this in. The class was made up of different social/racial/gender/whatever cross sections. Everyone watched the first half and they showed up and stayed for the final half the following week, some people even came up to tell me how much they liked it. Only 2 people have given bad responses, one person because he did not finish watching it and the other because she doesn't like watching a film with subtitles.From the rating for this movie it is clear that there are people who hate this film, but if you belong to the other 85% of the population than you will love it.Why did I like this movie? It was a \"mystery\" movie with clues throughout. They made an entire movie with (basically) two characters. There was no pointless tacked on sex, not even a kiss.Watch the Directors Cut if you can. The movie was actually more enjoyable the second time around. 10/10", "I saw this movie with my girlfriend. I don't think we stopped laughing at it for a bit. I think this is one of the funniest movies ever. Everything from it made me feel happy. This has about the most well defined characters you'll ever see on film that are true to how they really are. I enjoyed this film so much. The girl was really cute, and she was mean and she was sweet. The guy wanted a girl and all he ever really found was this girl who was actually a guy. Then the movie got really sad. I couldn't believe why the girl was so sad, but that part made me cry. It ended up being a quest on trying to find out what true love is. Letting go is a really hard thing, but letting go of something else you've found when you find out how dear that really is to you can mean the entire world in the end. I love this movie... :)", "Saw this movie with absolutely zero expectations...was almost asleep and watched it at a friend's place to pass the time. To my surprise, while it is not the best movie, it is definitely one of my favorites of the year and one of my favorite comedies of all time. I hope I get a chance to see it again because apparently there are a lot of little subtle things in it that you don't see the first or maybe even the second time around.\nI think some people get too caught up in the fact that the movie lacks realism, but I think that's what makes it all the wackier and funnier. I usually have a very low regard for Asian comedies, but this one was certainly worth watching. Absolutely hilarious but maintaining a touching side to it. The characters and situations are so interesting and absorbing that you tend to forget that you are being manipulated by all the sappiness.", "I haven't seen such movie st&#305;ry is excellent director put up a great job and both lead actor and actress is perfect.This movie is a theatrical feast.The actor played his role like he is playing his life actress (really pretty girl) played like she was born to act this role.The story?Its perfect its the first time have seen lots of people laughing and crying at the same time.You may think these things cannot happen then watch it and experience a new kind of feeling. After i watch this movie i reconciled with my ex-girlfriend.This movie left great effect on me and many people i know i think you should have this movie on DVD and keep it, watch it whenever you feel like divorcing or breaking up.", "Well, I'm not as sassy as The Girl. Thus, i provide some reasons for it! Here are the reasons why you should watch \"My Sassy Girl\"!!!:-it's funny! (the acting, the facial expression,the plot and specially all of my favorite train (barf & bet), motel, theme park, story telling and their parents scenes!)-it's naughty! (the acting by Cha Tae-hyun and part of the editing are TRICKY with a twist of SCI-FI!)-it's beautiful! (the film score, the cinematography, the scenic views and Jun Ji-hyun, of course!)-it's innocent! (the acting and the love between Cha Tae-hyun and Jun Ji-hyun and the beauty of Jun Ji-hyun)-it's crazy! (the series of unexpected events happen in the movie)-it's wacky! (the character which is played by Jun Ji-hyun)-it's natural! (the acting by the cast and the beauty, the compositing, the smile and the tears of Jun Ji-hyun)-it's sweet! (the love, the smile and the interaction between Cha Tae-hyun and Jun Ji-hyun)-it's romantic! (my favorite piano playing Canon in D major scene! this is not your so-called average love story and it's romantic in an unexpected way!)-it's touching! (the score, the movie, mountain, balcony, 10 date rules scenes and the ending that i always weep over for several times!)-it's refreshing! (neither a typical nor ordinary romantic love flick!)-it's superb! it's excellent! it's tremendous! it's fascinating! it's captivating! It's perfect! (the MOVIE, the CAST, the ACTING, the DIRECTOR, the CREW, Jun Ji-hyun, Cha Tae-hyun, their EFFORT, the SCREENPLAY, the MUSIC, the CINEMATOGRAPHY, the ONE-TAKE balcony scene and everything!)-it's SASSY! (explanation is unnecessary because it's SASSY!)-it's LOVE! (well, watch it for yourself!)-it's a CLASSIC! (no doubt due to its uniqueness and originality)-it's a MUST WATCH! (don't ask me why!)-it's my ALL TIME FAVORITE! (i just simply couldn't resist romance movie with a twist of comedy and SCI-FI! Too many favorite scenes inside the movie for me! It's absolutely my pot of Jjigae(Korean steamboat)!) Yum yum!And here is my final advice - Just watch it and stop reading my review if you are a real movie lover! It's absolutely worth to be watched at least 3 times in lifetime. One alone, one with your beloved one and another one to enjoy seeking the hidden details which are nicely set-up by the director! OK, just watch it! Would you?You won't be regret! But if you are regret after watching it, sorry for my terrible obsession with this movie or probably infatuation with Jun Ji-hyun!\"I met a man from the future.\" & \"Fate is building a bridge of chance for someone you love.\" are my favorite quotation from the movie!Strongly and highly recommended! Too bad i can't rate it more than 10 out of 10! (Personally, i don't fancy Hollywood to be able to bring out the feeling and the message by remaking it!)", "Although there were a couple of scenes that didn't quite translate for me, the movie overall was a great romantic comedy. The first two or three encounters, especially, were ripe for laughs. This is a good date movie and one that just about any audience can get into.The repeated chance encounters add something to the standard romantic comedy formula, as does the protagonist's continued willingness to take the girl's abuse. You get the feeling he doesn't quite know why he's taking it, and he doesn't particularly like it, but can't help himself. That's probably as good an analogy of romantic love as any.I'd say this movie is as appealing to women as it is to men; after we watched it my girlfriend knocked me down and kicked me a few times.", "I watched this film by mistake - I simply didn't ender the right saloon, but I don't sorry for that at all. Why you should watch it? it surely is different from the other films that you've watched lately the actors are young and they love playing, not like the spoiled Hollywood \"wunderkinds\"it's funnyit's realistic /with real emotions and problems of the young people - no matter whether they are in Asia, Europe, or America/at least for this short time, you can feel something of the culture. I am sure, that you won't find the time for watching the movie lost and won't regret it, like I didn't.", "This Korean film was unbelievablely popular last year in China, but I didn't see it at that time, because I sort of unconsciously have a dislike to something that nearly everybody else is crazy over.But everybody I knew recommended this film. So I finally decided to see it, this morning, and it won me instantly. I am not a keen fan for romantic comedies, though I do enjoy films like Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail, etc. This film should fall in the same category. The lead roles are brilliant. The girl of the film, you might not like her at start, but as the film goes along she just turns more and more beautiful as you get to know her and her past. The boy, on the other hand, is likeable from the word go (not the handsome type, but quite funny). The comedy is enjoyable and provides some good laughs, but as the film develops into the second hour it just turns so romantic. Of course everybody knows the boy and girl will get together in the end, but the process is really \"tormenting\". This might not be a great film, but it's truly romantic and great fun to watch. 8 out of 10.", "In all the Asian comedies i've seenand i have seen a lot this is by far my favorite The way \"the girl\" acted could sound like shes a complete bitch, but she remains likable during the whole movie. when she bosses kyun around it's hilarious,because you could see that happening.this movie isn't really like American chick flicks, the 2 characters aren't all over each other,and there isn't a major \"break up\" thing in the middle like some American movies were the couple breaks up and the guy or girl goes beyond measure to get each other back not saying thats bad but its nice to see something different.instead of that the character take a long mutual agreed time apart, and each try to improve themselves for when they finally get back together.and the story about the time machine old guy is creative and makes you wonder if he is from the future. this was based on the blog writings of Kim Ho-sik a korean man, who wrote this of the way he and his girlfriend meet.the ending was very creative and cute.all in all i give it a 11 if possible", "Highly recommended with a warning: do not expect a Hollywood recipe? Brief review: Very funny, yet deep down very romantic. However, the main character -the Sassy Girl- is so scared of falling in love, again, that she never lets any cheesy romantic moment between her and her boyfriend/good friend, also for you.. so guys, come on, sit down and watch and enjoy it. A small reminder, it is a Korean movie and I watched it with English subtitles.The story is about a guy in Korea, who is forced to visit her aunt whom he does not like to visit much and ends up meeting a drunk girl in the subway, whom he carries to a motel room, because she is drunk as a skunk and vomits everywhere. well, he tries to look the other way but feels sorry for her. however, as it is often said, no good deed goes unpunished and he finds himself even in jail because of her, and quite often if i may add. but then again, when she is not drunk, she is a funny and though-looking girl with so much sorrow inside that he can not help bearing whatever she brings to his life.Towards the end of the movie, the characters and their past and future are explored in more details without loosing anything from the funny style. Both lead actor and the actress are good but I think the guy is a little bit better. I loved his reactions, especially during squash games. Not to mention the times he was beaten by his mom (well, eastern society rules, I guess :) ) What about the midnight visit to the fair ground part? Funny..Very nice, very funny, very emotional movie. I think this may be a great Valentine Day movie..Definitely makes you think about destiny, if there is one. I like the definition of destiny in this movie, too.", "I've had this movie for a while but the title's always pulled me back from watching it..and yesterday I finally did out of pure boredom. And after watching it I gotta say that My Sassy Girl is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's an emotional and funny film. And everything that happens in the movie is just so well structured. I don't see why anyone shouldn't give this movie a go even if it is Korean... you will be inspired by it. It'll take you on an emotional roller-coaster which will make you laugh... and cry. This story of Ho-sik Kim is a beauty and he has managed to put it into film and I'm pretty sure that at some point in the movie you will be moved by it because it relates to someone you know, or yourself so well..well at least that's it in my case ;)", "hi..well i understand the point of koreans that this kind of relationship in my sassy girl is not common to their culture..yes that's the point, what makes this movie a hit because it shows a different kind of relationship that really inspired a lot of viewers all over the world specially here in the Philippines..because if i'm not mistaken their culture is more closer to us..now all i can say is that I was very touched by this movie, I have now a positive point of view towards love on how to make everything special...I really love jeon ji hyun because she used to be had a different attitude and personality..try also to watch her 2004 movie entitled \"WINDSTRUCK\" and you know what i really want to say..you will really love her..but for me windstruck is just second to my sassy girl", "I don't know how many times i have watched the movie, because i like the story very much. Its like the story of my classmate and I in my university (because she never become my girlfriend thats why she's just my friend). They have the same traits with the girl in the movie. Thats why I called her sassy girl. First I never expected to like the movie. but when I saw it I cannot help myself to watch it everyday. I bought a copy for myself for me to review the movie everyday... I cried when Gyun Woo gave her blind date 10 rules and the theme song starts to play. This is one of the part that I like most. second was when she played the piano and Gyun Woo gave her a rose. I like the piano piece very much..So watch the movie and see for yourself the hilarious comedy in korean movie history.", "This movie is proof that making love stories does not have to include raunchy sex scenes and nudity (take notes Hollywood!). This is as heartwarming and affectionate as a movie can get without getting too sappy. The first half of the movie is pure comedy, showing how a hapless boy and an erratic girl get to know each through a series of humorous hangouts. The girl only gives a glimpse of the inner turmoil she suffers in the first half. The second half explore her pain more deeply and also explains why the boy is willing to put up with her outrageous and unpredictable behavior. The last part brings everything full circle.I will also say, this movie is so good because the two lead actors have unbelievable chemistry. Gianna Jun particularly had an Oscar worthy performance and indeed probably would have won an Oscar for a similar performance in a Hollywood film. But sadly this gem of movie hasn't gotten the international attention that it deserves in my opinion. Not just one of the best Korean movies, but one of the best movies ever in any language."], "1354": [], "1355": [], "1356": ["EXO Next Door is a show that has a lot of cringe within it and really makes you roll your eyes a bit. Ever since I became an EXO-L, I heard about how bad this show is, but truly, I think it has charms. Sure, it's not one of the best dramas ever to be made, it's not a 10/10 rating all over the board and it's not winning any Oscars or awards of that calibre. However, I think there is some real charm within this. The first few episodes are definitely quite cringy, and I definitely considered dropping it after the first 3-4, however, the middle of the series isn't too bad. If you can make it to around episode 6, then you can pretty much finish this off without it being too cringe. The last couple of episodes - the last one in particular - were extremely well done. I felt like there could have been more added to the storyline per se, it was all a bit give and take, I think. There was a lot where EXO could have done more with their acting, there was a lot where Gayoung could have toned down Inchul Gal a lot more as well. I don't know where the line was drawn between being way too much and way too little. This isn't to knock the acting at all, don't get me wrong - I think all actors and actresses did really well with what they were given for the show, I think the script and character writing could have just balanced it out a bit more. I keep saying this does have a bit of a cringe factor, and truth is, if the characters had been toned down a notch or toned up a notch then I think that wouldn't have occurred - this is my own personal opinion, I know quite a few people who love it how it is.This is a show that definitely has charms. When I say it has a potential rewatch factor, there are some episodes I will definitely watch again, namely the last three. I wouldn't watch the entire season again, it's too much - especially the first few episodes. The storyline was well written, but again, it all came down to the characters themselves on why I wasn't too keen on this. Incheon Gal was way too over the top; I know she was supposed to be but it did quite get on my nerves.All in all, I think at least every EXO-L should give this a try. My bias list is in tatters, I laughed and cried my way through it and - surprisingly - a member of EXO doesn't die in this one! A rarity!", "A sort drama (only ten to fifteen minutes per episode) staring the boy band EXO and even though someone would expect it to be just a badly covered advertisement for the band and maybe some products as well, it surprisingly isn't. The story is nice and funny as well: four members of the band move next door to a girl's house. The girl is forced to become their cleaning lady by her mother. All the while, Chanyeol is trying to find a locket that his grandfather had left to change his bad luck and D.O. falls for her. Okay, the main thing that bothered me was the girl's face. When she liked a guy or got embarrassed it turned red...well more like hot pink alien like. That was simply too weird and silly. Plus, the locket thing was really silly as well. But you can't expect much from a drama like this one, so you should just overlook those faults and just enjoy the drama. And sure enough, it is a funny drama and it can be watched from a non fan as well as fans (I'm not a fan and I enjoyed it and my friend who's an exo L also liked it so I think it goes both ways...). Plus, the romance was good, with the love triangle nice enough, and the band drama was convincing enough. All in all, a must see for exo fans, an entertaining drama for a quiet afternoon (or two).", "Exo next door is a very good show. It is really funny and entertaining. You should watch it!

Although we don't know resurrected victims are real or not, the movie is highly enjoyable. It's based on the murder of a prosecutor's mother. As the film goes, they show how the murder happened. So, it gets interesting more and more.The plot is like wrapped in a mystery. It's a simple murder case, but it's kind of complex inside which gives you some excitements. It's one of those movies of simple-plot-but-a-great-one. Everything is good, including the performances of actors and actresses, except that actress who played as prosecutor's sister. Her acting was like she was a crazy girl. In a scene where she was afraid, her acting didn't seem that she was afraid. More like she was crazed. So, her acting was very bad.All in all, it shows a mother's love, even the children don't care that much about their mother. Regardless of it's fiction or not, the movie is great and enjoyable.", "RV: Resurrected Victims is a supernatural South Korean drama and thriller. It convinces with a creative story line, sinister atmosphere and intriguing characters. The film however suffers from being too melodramatic and lacking realism.The movie tells the story of a young prosecutor whose mother was killed in an armed robbery seven years ago. The prosecutor has become a bitter man who often recommends the death penalty instead of believing in redemption. One day, his sister calls him to tell that their deceased mother has come back home. The prosecutor hurries home in disbelief and gets attacked by his own mother. He learns that she is a resurrected victim that wants to avenge her own death. The prosecutor fails to understand why his mother attacked him in the first place. He starts digging in his own past in order to clear his name and give his mother peace of mind.On the positive side, the unusual story line is filled with unpredictable twists and turns that keep the movie interesting from start to finish. The characters also have certain depth as we learn more about the prosecutor's past and the mother's motivations. The film has an eerie and uneasy atmosphere between the mystery and horror genres even though the movie remains a supernatural crime investigation at heart.However, the movie has a somewhat dull pace in the middle section. The opening sequence is memorable and the conclusion is very emotional but everything in between has considerable lengths. The movie is also highly emotional and at times quite melodramatic. It attempts to be a tearjerker but goes a little bit overboard at times which can actually be observed in many Korean movies. The fact that the movie tries to connect human emotions with supernatural spirits sometimes seems like a contradiction. It's an unusual approach which makes it difficult to find an emotional connection to the story, especially since the mother turns out being not the only resurrected victim in the story.If you like supernatural dramas with surprising stoy lines, you should certainly watch this movie. If you don't like emotional movies with philosphical depth, you might find that film annoying. RV: Resurrected Victims has a quite unique style but attempts to accomplish too many things at once in my opinion. It was entertaining to watch but hard to digest. I don't regret watching it at all but wouldn't watch it again.", "Wow, a fantastic premise excellently executed. This was interesting from the word GO and the mystery and excitement never ceased until the thrilling climax. With so many secrets and reveals, the film deserves more than just one viewing. The cast was excellent. One can't help but wish for RV to become a reality."], "1361": [], "1362": ["This was a GREAT drama. It's a sad Korean melodrama and by far, one of the most saddest Korean dramas I've ever seen.It starts out with Suh Joon-young and Park Hae-in who grow up as childhood friends. Hae-in is blind and Joon-young becomes her protector. As they grow up, their love from childhood grows far beyond into a committed love that will last the rest of their lives. The story revolves around Joon-young, Hae-in, and another character, Lee Gun-woo.Kwon Sang Woo is one of my favorite Korean actors and I heard about the story from another friend and decided to watch it. Little did I know, I would be bawling from start to finish. It has a typical storyline, like many of the other dramas, but the characters were played really well by Kwon Sang Woo and Kim Hee Sun. I loved every single episode; they were all worth watching. This is by far, my FAVORITE K-drama and one of the saddest ones out there. Overall, it's a great drama and worth watching.", "I don't know why there are so less review for this series. I Watched this in my Desktop recently and believe me it is one of the best Korean drama. The characters looked so realistic and amazing acting. I completed all the episodes in just three days as I could not wait to watch the next episode when an episode ends. The story is a bit like a \"Autumn in my heart\" but this is different in its own sense. Some of the episodes are really going to make you cry. If you like Korean drama like Autumn in my heart, I am sorry I love you, than you should definitely watch this. The songs and music are also wonderfully done and you will surely want to hear again after you complete watching the series. I am not going to spoil by discussing the story line. But one should definitely watch this series and believe me you are going to enjoy each and every episodes."], "1363": [], "1364": [], "1365": ["I watched this movie with no expectations and was brought on a roller coaster ride of emotions. All the highs and lows of love are here and presented through visually emotional camera work as well low-key yet powerful acting. When I'd finished watching, there was a gut-wrenching feeling in me that lingered for days. There is little dialogue in this film. Yet it speaks volumes because of the performances of Lee Young-Ae and Yu Ji-Tae. Each look, each gesture, each simple touch said more than a thousand words. If you want a genuine portrayal of a love affair from its beginning to its end, then watch this.", "This isn't a film about plot, so I'll concentrate on describing the main characters. Sang-Woo is a single sound engineer living with his family. Eun-su is a radio show host who lives about 4 hours away, by herself in a small, somewhat messy apartment. They meet to record the sound of wind in a bamboo forest for her radio show, and a relationship develops between them. The film observes them over the course of the changing seasons in Korea, starting in the Spring both in terms of the calendar and their relationship.The pace is deliberate, and the characters don't really change much, but the film is beautiful and, not surprisingly, lovely to listen to, and it's definitely worth seeing. I think that the male lead (Ji-tae Yu) is particularly good in his role. My understanding is that the film won the top prize at Korea's equivalent to the Academy Awards.I saw this at the San Francisco International Film Festival on 4/21/2002, where an earlier showing was the U.S. premiere. The director was present to answer questions, through an interpreter, and one of his responses indicated that viewers who are more experienced in love tend to identify with the female lead, while those less experienced see themselves in the male character.", "Although Alfred Lord Tennyson said, \"Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all\", anyone who has endured the breakup of an intense relationship would not necessarily agree. Certainly not Lee Sang-woo, the young sound engineer from Seoul, Korea in Hur Jin-ho's exquisite second feature One Fine Spring Day (literally Spring day goes). In the film of quiet power, two young people meet, fall in love, then gradually pull back and withdraw, but the film is not about their circumstances, but about the impermanence of life and how we must learn to ride the roller coaster. Like Hur's 1998 film Christmas in August, it is a realistic and intimate work, filled with a touching lyricism that never succumbs to manipulative devices.Working to record sounds of nature for a radio station, Sang-woo and radio disc jockey Han Eun-su meet at a bus station in a most unusual way. Unable to wake her from a bench in the waiting room, he calls her on his cell phone even though she is sitting right next to him. As they work together, their relationship develops slowly. She has recently been divorced and he lives at home with his father, aunt, and grandmother. The joy of discovering a new relationship is conveyed against a background of nature \u0096 its mountains, forests, and streams and, as we listen to the two recording the sound of the wind against the bamboo and the wheat fields, we are struck by the mood of serenity created by the cinematography of Kim Hyeong-gyu and the original music of Jo Sung-woo, based on the French ballad, \"Plaisir D'amour\".Impermanence is a constant theme in the film and the seasons represent various stages in the character's relationship. To underscore the fleeting nature of love, Sang-woo's grandmother denies that her deceased husband was ever unfaithful to her and, barely in touch with reality, goes to the train station everyday to wait for him. Though Eun-su lives in the provinces, she and Sang-woo begin to meet each other after work and spend some nights together. On the surface, they are an attractive couple - warm, sensitive, and very cute together. But Hur drops hints that each, in their own way is eager to pull away from what looks like it might become a lasting relationship. Though the reason for their growing coolness toward each other is not specifically defined, she may be reacting to the fallout from her last marriage or may be put off by his tendency to cling. In his first real relationship, he may be having thoughts that it is too soon to close off other possibilities in life.Neither, however, communicates their fears and, like a flower that is not being nurtured, their relationship is allowed to wither. As she withdraws, he pursues her even more, giving her the upper hand and placing her in a controlling position and Sang-woo is run by his expectations and disappointment, drinking and hiding out when things start to turn sour. In \"One Fine Spring Day\", we learn that, as in the Buddhist tradition, life has the characteristics of instantaneity, impermanence, and decay and that the three realms are deceptive and illusory in nature. We share Sang-woo's discovery of the joy of love and also its confusion and pain. Literally, not too much happens in the film, and, on paper it sounds ordinary, but, like the poetry of Walt Whitman, if we look beneath the surface we can easily see the divine in the commonplace.", "This is another very quiet film by Hur about the relationship between two people.  Like \"Christmas in August\" the direction is such that excessive dialogue is unnecessary.  We know what the two people involved are thinking at all times through their eyes, the way the look (or don't look) at each other.It's a story that anyone who has had any experience in love will immediately recognize and get that \"I have been there\" feeling.  The film doesn't sympathize with one person or the other but you probably will empathize with one of them based on your own experiences in love and loss.  Two people fall in love, one of them falls out of love (or does she?), is anyone to blame?", "Although I didn't like April Snow, I have to admit that I got curious about it's clinical, meditative, and almost Ozu-like approach to start searching out its director's previous films. One Fine Spring Day is Hur Jin-Ho's second feature film. Surprisingly though, the film feels like it's been crafted by a master who's been making films for decades. One Fine Spring Day evokes a certain sense of maturity and control that deflects the low points of its spare plot. Sang-woo (Yu Ji-tae) is a sound engineer who lives with his father and his senile grandmother. He gets a job to record certain sounds of nature with beautiful radio DJ Eun-su (Lee Young-ae). Sang-woo, who seems to be an extrovert and Eun-su, who is more outgoing and openminded, get along very well and start a relationship. Their relationship, however, is not the type that would last forever as both characters are very different and both have issues that need to be resolved. Those seeking something that will provide for a fuzzy joyous romantic feeling would easily get disappointed with One Fine Spring Day. One Fine Spring Day, despite its rather light atmosphere, holds a bittersweet conclusion that feels all too real for comfort. It matches the joys of falling in love with the pangs of an unexplained break up. The beauty of the film doesn't emanate from the plot, or the characterizations, or even the technical merits, but from Hur's surehanded direction that never seems to stray from its melancholic tone. Hur doesn't waste time in dealing with heartwarming moments or scenes of melodramatic intensity. He satisfies himself with sincere moments of silence that somehow evoke great emotional weight. One Fine Spring Day is a lovely film. I loved the fact that it never breaks into serious drama or comedy. It stays right there, comfortable in the middle, chronicling in a very sure manner the failing relationship of the couple. It's very different from April Snow which I thought tried too hard to build up its setup with a more ominous atmosphere that bogs down whatever talent and effort Hur and the rest of his crew put in entirely.", "From the very beginning, this film reminds me of a Japanese filmmaker Ozu. Well, there are few lines for characters and little music, they exchange their feeling by their facial expression. The film has a stereoscope effect owing to describe the vast nature image. It is all the more interesting that the subtle movement of love is contrasted with that immense spring nature.I guess the impression of this film is dependent on each person because the film leaves room for thinking more deeply about their relationship and their character. Superficially, Eun-su looks a little wicked since she leaves him suddenly, but I think there is something about her. She was divorced once and she may need someone to rely on. Also, Sang-woo lost his mother and is seeking for maternity in Eun-su. Both want someone to depend on but what they want in their partner is different. So they keep passing each other.Like August in Christmas(the previous film of Jin-ho Hur), their love is one way. Namely, an young pure innocent person loves an elder person. And the elder one leaves him or her at the end. The film makes me wonder how and what the young learn through love. Do you think he can recover from the loss?", "I will not go into the details of the plot, but will make an attempt to explain the relationships between the two main characters.A divorced woman, who lives alone in her messy city apartment and occasionally drinks herself to sleep meets a guy by starting a new sound recording project. They were assigned to be a team, and slowly but surely their mutual attraction develops. The woman feels lonely and she takes it to a new level when she invites him to spend a night at her apartment. The guy has never had any serious relationships before. This is his first love. Before meeting her he leads a simple yet happy life with his dad and his grandma. His aunt occasionally visits the family to take care of the grandma who is slowly losing her memory. The guy is loved by his family and he loves them back. Later we learn that he lost his mom at an early age.Their relationships blossoms. The woman enjoys his company because he makes her life more orderly by bringing kimchi and making ramen noodles. Without him her sleeping patterns are completely messed up and she feels lonely. The guy enjoys making her happy, he practically glows with happiness (his co-workers and family started to notice) and would like to get serious about their future as a family. The woman insists on secrecy. She mentions that the guy may lose his job if somebody finds out about their affair. The guy is ready to give up his job in order to keep her - this is how serious he is. In reality, his sudden request to see his father scares her. She did not expect that he would get so serious about it so soon. She does not feel right about the relationship. She understands what a great guy he is but feels inadequate since she has already been divorced. Being torn from her desire to be with him and her guilt of being in a wrong relationship, she suggests to spend a month apart. When this does not work, she tells hims she wants to break up with him. She even starts a new (continues her old?) relationship to forget him.As with any person whose true love was rejected, he suffers a great deal and becomes almost a stalker. We do not see the tormented feeling the woman goes through, but we see the agony of the guy. He spends a night in a parking lot next to her apartment building, follows her to her friend's house and even goes as far as keying her lime green car. He is ready to give up his job for her, yet he does not get it: why did she leave him? His family and friends are very supportive of him. Then his grandmother dies.The woman calls him back. She wants to see him again.He comes to meet her, but when she mentions that she would like to continue their relationships, he rejects her. You can see that he still loves her, because this decision does not come easy to him. He has to make an enormous effort not to follow her when she walks away.You can also see that the woman loves him too. When she turns around and sees him standing, she could have come back and make him start over. But she finds the inner strength and empathy to let him go because she was not sure that she was the right person who could make him happy.", "I saw this film at the 2002 San Francisco International film festival and it was, by far, the best film of the ten I saw. Some of the others were so bad, that if it hadn't been for this one film, I would have considered my ten ticket pass to be a waste of time (if not money). This is a romantic film with a very cute and unique story line that alone, would make it worth seeing. But the sound editing and the cinematography really put it over the top in my opinion. One sound and visual sequence in a bamboo forest will stand out in my memory forever.Unfortunately, for those of us who would love to see it again, or those who have never seen it, this film did not get released in the US and is not available on DVD or video.", "When I finished watching this film, I was reminded of what poet Lord Tennyson said about love: 'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. And I agree with others who have commented here on the film that it s only if you have loved and had been loved that you fully appreciate the film.One aspect of the film that I found most interesting was that Eun-su (Lee Yoeng-Ae) and Sang-woo (Jit-taeYue) met and fell in love because of sound but yet the acting was mostly silent. A simple gesture or a grimace here and there conveyed with clarity the powerful emotions and inner turmoil of these two main characters.I am grateful that I saw the film. It was so refreshing and so different that it was sort of a catharsis and I actually said to myself, \"I needed that\" when it was over.", "Its not about plot, not about twist nor about something unbelievable. This is a film that concentrate on characters and their different points of view. Dialogues are very modest in expression. Director uses rather non-verbal communication. Shy look there, insecure touch there or actions that tells us more then words. All that accompanied by great cinematography complemented by sensual music or sounds of bamboo. Audience can enjoy that thanks to slow storytelling and long pauses filled with body language. Back to the story. Jin-ho Hur tells a story about 2 individuals and their evolving relationship. Sang-woo is a young sound technician inexperienced with strong feelings. He meets Eun-so recently divorced radio announcer. Director shows the beginning of their relationship with creating overwhelming atmosphere of excitement and happiness that even spreads on the audience. **Spoiler Alert**However just like in life at some moment everything starts to go wrong. Director don't give us clear answer what is going on because just as it happens in those situations you can only insinuate. From this point everyone starts to cheer only for one of the main characters. Those less experienced by love go with Sang-woo. Those that tasted ups and downs of loving stand with Eun-so no matter which sex they're representing. Ending is perfectly directed. As Eun-so and Sang-woo meet up after some time she puts him again at crossroads. As he declined its clear that he finally made peace with it. As she goes away we can clearly see his hesitation. In this moment thanks to film shot without depth of field her going away is like fading of a memory. ** End of Spoilers**As i mentioned before great cinematography is accompanied by amazing music and that builds great background to the story. However at some point this omnipresent music started to get on my nerves. I just think there is a little bit too much of it. As someone before me noted the easiest way to describe this film is to quote Alfred Lord Tennyson: \"Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all\"", "You might expect that this movie, like all the other common consumer movies, that would be like stereotypical features, but that's not the case. \nAlways the audience makes a general definition of the melodrama genre in his mentality, and in front of his default, he is directed to a film that is not far from its presuppositions.\nBut the creation of a romantic film that can literally deal with the petitions of an emotional relationship is praiseworthy.\nJoining and separating two verbs is an inseparable part of relationship in the cinema, but setting to these two is not attractive alone.\nRomance movie needs some kind of subject writing. In this context, it is a more successful film that set to detail.\nI saw a good spring day movie on a good spring day, the first day of the spring of 2018.\nWithout exaggeration, the other romantic films I had seen, was in far space.\nThe culmination of the story is a fascinating reminder of a collapsing and annihilating relationship in which both conflict different behaviors in spite of their psychological and internal reaction, despite the emotion they are involved with.\nThe point to be considered here is that the problem that originally causes conflict and heterogeneity in their relationship is precisely where the one is willing to agree, and the other does not want to, and this position is changing.\nEventually, in the end of our film, we face an approach that is not happy end at all and confirm the signature of the modern structure of the film.\nThis movie should be seen because of its state of affairs and suitable for today.", "I saw this film at the San Francisco film festival several years ago. I had a ten film pass and this ONE film made sitting through some of the other very boring, tedious films worth the price of the ten pass ticket (note: I am an avid foreign and independent film person). The cinematography, film score, editing and acting are superb. I still have the one of the films amazing images - a bamboo forest waving in the winds engraved in my memory.I hoped to see it on the independent and film circuit after the film festival, so that I could let others know to go see it .... but it never showed up. I have found it for sale online but not with and English subtitle. I hope, that eventually, the films distributors, either release it for a US theatrical run or put out an English dubbed version so that I can but it.", "This is Damn Good Drama !!!There is no talk about this movie, you know why?

If you saw this film, you would vaguely be aware of the idea.but i think the film should be shortened to less than 100 minutes. There are quite a few plots that would make you sleepy all the times.

But threw a twist of fate due to a computer error, Kang Ho becomes an employee of a world class company.

Sure they didn't end up together in the end but that doesn't necessarily mean it was sad. If they'd stayed together, Seunghee would forever have the insecurity that he would regret ever meeting her. And he would've always had the \"what if they'd never met & he managed to achieve his dream\" thought in his head. They wouldn't have made each other happy. The true happy ending for them comes here when they've finally let each other go & he's able to be mature enough to respect her choice and come to terms with the fact that although they love each other, they don't belong together. In the end, they both got the closure they needed for their relationship & you can tell they're both relieved that instead of them having a \"bad\" past, they can now look at each other as a wonderful memory of their youth. amazing movie.

And it all started in a foreign country.Seung-wan, the aspiring pilot, is coming to Singapore to meet the girlfriend he knew from high school Chae-young who is in the country to study English. Se-jin, the aspiring diplomat, is travelling to Singapore on a holiday in memory of her late boyfriend. Misunderstand ensued after the two of them had cleared the airport customs.Worse still, Se-jin's backpack was left accidentally in the taxi that Seung-wan was taking to meet his girlfriend. It naturally left Se-jin fuming.But what was worse for Seung-wan was that he had no idea that his high school girlfriend had been seeing someone else in the name of Do-hyun. After a search of his girlfriend with whom he met after the airport customs Se-jin through Singapore's known tourist attractions, it was all in vain. He decided to check in for the night at a resort hotel and saw that Se-jin was still tagging him. Or at least he only knew the morning after.The two went back to Korea without the other's knowledge. And it was the start of the comedy, drama and the mayhem to come.Titled 'Wonderful Life' in its English translation, it has all those of what I had mentioned in the previous paragraph.", "Wonderful Life is a sweet and heartwarming drama about having a family.It shows the complexities of how two people,who never loved one another initially, decided to get married to face the responsibilities brought about having a child after having a one-night stand. The 16-hour drama is the story of two young college students who accidentally become parents because of the one-night stand they had during vacation. They then get married. These young and inexperienced parents will show you what true love really means and how they become more mature by overcoming life's difficulties together and how they complete their love.This Korean drama presents to us how these two people handle the intricacies,hardships,difficulties and problems of having one. It realistically sends the viewers a message that having a family and a child is a VERY BIG RESPONSIBILITY.The acting was great. Kudos to both Kim Jae-won and Kim Yoo-jin/Eugene for both had great chemistry and were credible as immature and inexperienced parents. The same goes to the child who acted as Shin Bi. I saw it in 2 days and I was hooked on it after Episode 1. It effectively brought to me the realization of the complexities and challenges of having a family and having a child presents. Highly recommended especially for single people out there especially those who intends to have family soon. This is a lot better than Alone In Love,another Korean drama whose theme is also about family. Definitely an excellent drama!!!!"], "1373": [], "1374": [], "1375": ["After managing to see probably some 15-20 South Korean feature films produced between 1999 to 2005, I took the recommendation of the kind staff at my local Korean grocery store to check out the more popular TV series. Starring the rather lovely Song Hye-kyo, playing an internet novelist and the curiously monikered Rain as a wildly popular young movie star, on the one hand it's a good example of the quirky mix of slapstick comedy interspersed with rather sobering moments of heartbreak and frustration experienced by the characters. The surprising fact is that the first episode follows a similar plot line to House of Sand and Fog, which certainly wasn't a comedy and was absolutely full of despair. Girl inherits lovely house on the coast from parents, struggles financially, circumstances lead to her losing most of her possessions and having her home sold off underneath her feet, new owner has little sympathy at first. That's fortunately where the comparison ends! Plenty of moments of Song Hye-kyo screwing her face up in disgust by some awkward thing she's said or done, and Rain (wearing his rather strange low cut male-cleavage shirts) glancing into the ether whilst biting his lip do eventually lead to a building relationship between a very odd couple. Words can not describe how huge a hit this series was in much of Asia, so from even from this not so Asian reviewer, Full House holds a charming appeal.", "I'm only a third of the way through this series, but i can't help but comment, for i simply CANNOT get over how undeniably lovable this drama is.I'm not the type of person who watches romance dramas as they just don't interest me, but i went against my better judgement simply because i'd heard all my friends raving about this show. And wow, was i ever impressed.The story is essentially simple in its premise but has been made interesting by adding a mix of wit, slapstick humour and a great cast. I am not particularly a Rain fan and have never seen Song Hye-Kyo in anything previous to watching this show, but i was greatly impressed with their acting and the chemistry they shared.I found myself from being completely non-plussed by the whole drama to start off with, to constantly giggling and squeeing at the television; a reaction that has rarely happened in all the years i've been watching TV dramas.The only thing holding me back from giving it a 10/10 is the horrid wardrobe Yeong-Jae sports. I can't remember how many times i balked at the screen because he walked into the scene wearing yet another low-cut, cleavage revealing top and ridiculously mismatched pants, but i'm sure i would have made myself thoroughly hammered if i'd made a drinking game out of it ;D Rain's man cleavage aside, this is a wonderful drama to watch; i'd definitely recommend it :)", "This is a great starter for those who are interested in K-drama, or looking for a light, romance-comedy drama.. It's about this girl, Ji-Eun, an aspiring script-writer, who inherited this house named Full House(also the title of the drama) from her parents. Later, her friends cheated her and sold her house while she was having a vacation in China. During her vacation she met this superstar, Young-Jae who coincidently the one whom Ji-Eun's friends sold her house to. It'll later get all complicated and leads to a marriage contract between them. Ji-Eun will then falls for Young-Jae who's in love with his childhood friend, Hae-Won who is in love with their other friend, Min-Hyuk who likes Ji-Eun. It looks kinda complicated, but it's quite easy to understand, really... A two-thumbs up for this K-drama, mainly because of the chemistry between the two main leads, Rain and Song Hye Kyo as Young-Jae and Ji-Eun. A word of caution to those who are new to k-dramas... This will definitely hook you to other k-dramas, and you'll be left to wanting more k-dramas.. You have been warned.... (^^)", "this movie is really a romantic one.. rain act as leeyoungjae in the show.. he is an actor.. who is quite stubborn,proud,and like to shout at the others.. but he is also a caring and cute man.. but he hide those personalities.. he was too afraid to show it..song hyekyo make a change in this movie.. she always act as a weak girl in her pass movie.. and in this movie she act as a sweet, cute, sunshine,brave,and adorable girl.. and i think the quarrel between rain and song hye kyo make this movie interesting.. when i first saw this movie and laugh a lot.. but when the movie is approaching the end , i cry a lot.. it is a interesting and a touching movie... i love rain since i watch this movie..try to but it and enjoy the every part of the movie p.s.:i started to learn and to love Korea since i watch this movie.. this movie really changed my life... and i also learned the cute song about three bear since i watch this movie..just watch it and u will love it.. a romantic story happen between a strange girl and a star.. and the chemical reaction really happen.. just like Cinderella and the handsome prince..i just love it..", "Though I am an avid Korean film fan (mostly horror and action flicks the likes of Arahan, The Host, and the lovely My Sassy Girl), I have never watched its TV series because they tend to be too long and complicated. Full House (as well as other Korean TV series) became a hit in our country a few years back. I didn't mind it because I already have a big respect and fondness for its film industry.What got me interested was the young pop idol Rain. After watching his documentary on Discovery channel, and being interested in his skills as a performer (not to mention he's so cute), I started looking for his first TV series because of the good reviews. So I got the complete 20 episodes of Full House. What started off as an interesting journey became marked with sleepless nights (trying to finish at least 3-5 episodes a day), laughter and giggles, sentimental sniffles, excitement, anxiety, you name it.The story revolves around four main characters. A crazy but beautiful writer girl who owns a house and nothing more, and was duped by friends who sold her house without her knowledge; a movie actor (Rain) who buys the house and treats her like a maid in exchange for a place to stay; a fashion designer who is the superstar's best friend and secret love; and a rich, handsome producer who is interested in the writer girl. Eventually, the first two couple engage in a \"business marriage contract\" for publicity, while the last two tries to break them apart.Granted, the show has its flaws in the script. Sometimes, actions tend to be exaggerated. I'd get confused and frustrated with the leading lady's inability to leave Rain when she is totally mistreated. The fashion designer lacks the charm to sweep both men off their feet and is portrayed as a weak character despite her successful career. The other leading man is totally gorgeous and I sometimes wish the writer ends up with him instead. The superstar is quite a bit infuriating with his childish, sneaky ways, his tantrums, his inability to acknowledge love, and his stubborn, rude ways. But when you see him shed a tear in pain, arrrgh. There goes my heart. I believe that's what the writer girl felt too. We just couldn't leave him alone.Other flaws in the script? There are no violent kissing scenes. Not that I am complaining. From the very start, the show sweeps you off your feet with the development of each character, from the moment they all meet and weave in and out of each others' lives, and eventually becoming more involved with one another. It was one hell of a ride in the senses, to the very end when you would have wanted them to be more passionate physically.Add to that other characters: the writer's two scheming friends who conned her; the superstar's mom, dad, grandma and levelheaded boss...all have interesting quirks that add to the spice of this romantic comedy.I may be harping too much about this and leave you disappointed if you watch it. Well, if you're Asian like me, you will most likely relate to it more than the Westerners, who will see this as a bore (staying together in a house with such an explosive chemistry and nothing is ever happening will most likely raise your brows).I do like the show, though, and it's two thumbs up for me, simply because it draws so much emotion from me (just as it did My Sassy Girl where the odd couple really made me laugh and cry in ways I didn't expect), and it leaves me wanting more. Well, I also did want it to end soon and happily.I still hesitate to watch another Korean TV series (it drains the hell out of me trying to complete the show in one viewing). I will still prefer watching the movies. But for once, Full House has left me happy and dreaming, and craving for the innocent romance of younger days.", "Ji-eun is the owner of the house her parents had left behind which is called Full House (the English translation of the TV series). On her first holiday trip to Shanghai, she met a celebrity on the same plane she was boarding - Yeong-jae.That was the start of the things to come between the two of them.When Ji-eun returned home from the holiday trip, she soon found out that her two friends had sold her house and was clearly furious. To her, the house meant all the world to her. It's where Yeong-jae came into the picture and he decided to move in, in order for Ji-eun able to pay off her debts as being an internet novelist trying to make it big someday as a movie scriptwriter. The two even made a marriage contract and gotten married, much to the surprise of many, even the media.But like any other love stories, the two of them are caught in the tangle of Hye-won and Min-hyuk many a times. Also around this time, Yeong-jae's career had gone downhill. Yeong-jae had at times made snide remarks about Ji-eun's ability to become a movie scriptwriter. But the latter stuck to her beliefs. And in the end, her movie script was sent to Yeong-jae (he never knew at first) to play the lead role in a brand new movie which finally saw Yeong-jae back in the spotlight once more.And does Yeong-jae really able to confess how he really feels for Ji-eun? Comedy and the fights aside between Yeong-jae and Ji-eun, it's a pretty nice show. I first watched this on the DVD which my mother had it some time ago. Through the Mandarin translation, that is. It's recommended if you managed to find subtitles and/or translation suitable to your language ability.", "If Iam going to comment in this perfect Korean series I must be Fair first of all, the acting is really amazing the main actors play their roll with comedy parts and drama parts, song hye kyo is Abrilliant actress,she cute , charm and lovely. i think every one can fall in love with her once see her. Bi Rain , proof that he is Master in everything,his cutest and charming take huge part of his acting. and see his cute smile with his anger act show how much he can, do the character very will. the story is about agirl who get cheated by her friends and they take her house to get money for their baby born,when she find out,that they sell it to some superstar,she refused to let it go, and accept to sign contract, to marry him in exchange of prevent the girls from stalk him. its great series about love and proud.don't miss it its diamond of Asian arts", "What can I say? it's one of my favorite movies. It has everything: love, romance, action, sorrow, and happiness. hero & heroine of this film have wonderful chemistry together, and it shows. It makes you feel like you want to become a better person, and not be so selfish, self-centered, and makes you realize that there more important things in life.This movie is so indescribable and unique.I have seen it many times. I will admit that I am a hopeless romantic and I love to watch these types of movies.I think that it is so romantic and so beautiful and i think that the movie was made very well", "To westerners, the show, by most conventional means, isn't that great-- no sex(barely even kissing!)and no violence. While there are attractive characters, they aren't super sexed up and rely on their naivety and cuteness.The story centers around the faked marriage of Lee Youngjae (Rain) and Han Ji-Eun (Song Hyegyo). Han Ji Eun's parents died while she was in middle, leaving her an amazing home-- one of her only possessions. She's is tricked out of her home by her friends and they end up selling it to spoiled actor Lee Youngjae. Young Jae is in emotional turmoil after it appears that the woman he loves, Kan Hye-won, will leave for New York. When Kang Hye-won confronts Youngjae about his feelings for her at a press party, Youngjae covers to protect her instead saying that he loves Ji-Eun.In order to take a break from tabloids, Ji-Eun and Youngjae enter a contract marriage in which Ji-Eun will get the house back in the divorce. Overtime, the pair's quirky differences bring them together but not without emotional hardship. Youngjae has an attachment to Hye-won while Han Ji-Eun feels indebted, and attracted to, her boss, Yoo Min-Hyuk. (Yoo Min-hyuk also happens to be the object of Hyewon's affection) Eventually, Han Ji-Eun and Youngjae get married (for real!) as they realize that they \"sarangye\" (love) one another.Overall, the show is endearing and incredibly innocent when you consider what we watch in north America. Rain and Song Hye-kyo have amazing chemistry throughout the show, although, a very disappointing kiss at the end. The show's innocence proves that all is not lost in this world and it's definitely a show you should watch. While most westerners won't really understand, just get past the first two episodes and you'll be hooked!", "Yes, you read that right!If you have been feeling low and want to feel happy, go for this drama.This was the first korean drama I watched and absolutely loved it.Trust me, when I was watching this series, I had a happy feeling throughout. Yesss...this drama made me happy.The ever smiling Han Ji Eun gave me a new outlook towards life and taught me to smile no matter what.The cool and cute Young Jae makes you smile when he just can't express himself and ends up making us laugh again and again :DLee Young Jae's first love interest brings a lot of twist in the story.Yu min's character is also well written. He's so perfect that you sometimes end up feeling that Ji Eun goes to him. :)All in all..a must watch..you'll surely love it! \u2661", "The story is taken from a comic, because I remembered that I've read it somewhere. Hae Gyo really act like a different person, she's really full of spirit, she usually played as a weak person and very very easy to cry than laugh. Rain in this drama (Full House) acts as a spoil singer and he's too kind (he doesn't want to hurt his childhood friend but he's hurting someone that he loved). The chemistry between Rain and Hae Gyo is not shown enough, it just shown that actually they love each other but they don't want to say 'I love you' first. Both, Hae Gyo and Rain can act well, they really understand their character but I can't see the romanticism between them (except the ending).I like the soundtrack, it's good.", "though not the first Korean drama...but it was my first romantic comedy...with you're beautiful etc popular these days...i decided to start with full house...and boy!was i happy....this drama made me laugh throughout!since than i have seen it so many times..I've lost count:PP the best Korean drama ever...why? 1:the undeniable chemistry between song and rain...u just cant imagine that they r acting,,.its more like,they were told to do whatever they want and fixed the camera in front of them....this lacks in actors nowadays..u cant make out these days that they r acting..rather than being natural... 2:the humor and the happy feeling it gave...it left me wanting fr more...i was so much in luv that i wanted this couple to be real..who wont??it was never boring..the slapstick humor took me in... what wasn't rite in this drama..which took away the 1 point:clothes were bad,bad kiss,repetitiveness...that's all.. though ill always give the credit to this drama fr introducing me to rain...cause now...i respect and love that guy unlike other pop idols...whom i will like..but wont respect.. this drama deserved the hurricane popularity it got..and was main reason fr Korean wave..like a beautiful memory..it will always stay in my heart..", "To be honest I didn't think I would finish the drama because I thought it would be boring; But I liked it although there was a lot of things that I didn't like for example how Lee Young Jea treated Han Ji Eun and always left her waiting because of Kang Hye Won. I didn't like Kang Hye Won at all and I think she is selfish and doesn't care about Lee Young Jea feelings at all. I think the drama scenes kept repeating themselves and I kind of got bored. I liked Han Ji Eun more than Lee Young Jae and at some point I felt that she deserved a better man than him but in the end he really changed and proved that he can be a good husband. I'm going to miss the way they fight with each other, Han Ji Eun three bears song XD, and how Lee Young Jae get jealous over Han Ji Eun.", "The idea that an emotionally abusive, narcissistic (who has a semi-nude picture of himself in blue neon in his bedroom???!!) and infantile man can be thought of as \"attractive\" whilst playing out his insecurities through verbal abuse and put-downs of a woman he calls his wife (whether under contract) is a terrifying reflection of the normalisation of domestic and general abuse of women in this society. I could not get past the ugliness of those scenes and the manner in which Rain berates the Jeu Ein by calling her bird brain, chicken, rice cooker, vacuum cleaner etc. whilst telling her more than once in the show that she would never make it as a writer and it was best not to tire out her bird brain by putting so much effort into her writing! Cutesy kindergarten antics aside, media writers need to recognise that they bear a responsibility in society to put the right message across. Verbal psychological and emotional abuse is not romantic. It is not attractive. In extreme cases, it destroys lives and families.There is nothing romantic about putting down a woman who has nothing but her dreams left. Take that away, and in real life, you will find the cause of suicidal ideation in many women subjected to this constant abuse. They begin to believe such things about themselves. What these put-downs are telling these women are that they are inferior, stupid and useless and not deserving of their lives. One day, these women begin to believe these destructive messages, and when they do, they will self-destruct on a psychological, intellectual and emotional level. There are in fact, laws against such abuse. The message that should be communicated is that the damage that such constant put-downs cause is immeasurable and is nothing less than extreme emotional abuse amounting to harassment, which is illegal, and should be prosecuted and punished in every case. I am the mother of a beautiful, intelligent and talented young woman who was once told by a very expensive private male teacher that he would 'cut his head off' if someone so \"stupid\" could make it to high school in the express stream and, with that expression, destroyed in one stroke, the validation of her efforts and hardwork, her confidence and self-respect which we, as her parents, had painstakingly built up over the years. I am so thankful that we came to know of this abuse when we had to deal with my very distraught (then) 12 year old daughter, who trusted us enough to come to us with her pain, and that we were given a chance to step in as parents, fire the teacher, re-build our daughter's confidence with unconditional love and unswerving faith in her, and convince her of how precious she was by validating her self-worth over and over again (for the next 8 years - to date). I am pleased to say that my happy ending is that my little girl not only went on to express stream high school, she has also since come into her own, as a Cum Laude scholar in a top law school in Europe, who has since picked up a completely foreign language and is competing with local students on a native level, and winning. I am still waiting for that teacher's head!Imagine, the damage and the loss of potential, had we not known of what had happened? Imagine what could have happened if, we had not known of her loss of confidence and then added to the injury by scolding our little girl for a drop in grades? I dread to think of what my sensitive and fragile little girl could have done to herself.This drama left a particularly bad taste in my mouth, even more so, when the leading lady overlooked all that abuse to go back to the abuser, thinking that her love will change him. Does that sound familiar? The message that should have been responsibly put out is what I am leaving all women who have experienced this sort of abuse or worse need to know: \"Leopards don't change their spots. Their spots only get LARGER! GET YOUR KIDS, GET OUT, STAY OUT!\"", "Though the premise is ridiculous, and there are other obvious plot holes, the series is worth watching for the expert cast, especially the leads, and often hilarious scenes. There are better KDramas through the years since this one was filmed and helped launch the Korean wave, but none that will make viewers smile and laugh more.", "Happy Opening and happy Ending. between these two, there are a big tragedy. However, the director tries to make audience aware of pleasure through fiction scenes and Actors/Actress. That's amazing skill. and also the period ran in very short. I believe that's the secret to etch this drama in our heart forever. and also the song has very charm lyric. wow. I really love it. Thank you all. This is excellent masterpiece.", "Full House (2004, 16 episode) kdrama has ridiculous premise of two friends selling Ji-eun's house while she is on vacation in China. Out of cash in China, she turns to the obnoxious actor Young-jae, whom she annoyed on the airplane trip to China and he begrudgingly helps her. When Ji-eun returns home to an empty house, she finds the Young-jae is the new owner. They enter a contract marriage in which she'll earn the house and he'll make the love of his life jealous. Along the way they develop feelings for each other as fake becomes real but the couple has a hard time connecting until the very end. Without the compelling main couple, the show never would have worked. But they clicked and the show benefited. The story slowed down and was repetitive in the latter half of the series. Episodes 15 and 16 finally provided the emotional payoff.What I liked about Full House:1. Male lead, Rain, as Young-jae is either yelling/bickering at Ji-eun or bestowing an adorable grin. I had no idea Rain was a kpop star until after completing this series. His character was suited to his acting ability. When she taught him to ice skate or he became the housekeeper, he was very cute. He should done a song for the OST.2. Female lead, Song Hye-kyo, as Han Ji-eun was sparkling, adorable, gave Young-jae attitude and sassed him back. She didn't care if he yelled at her. You believed that she was falling in love with him. When they played in the park together, they were darling. Her relationship with his family was warm and she earned a place in their hearts singing the \"three bears\" song during their first meeting.What I did not like about Full House:1. Young-jae's friends, Hee-jin and Dong-woo, annoyed me. Fast forward material these two!2. The reasons why our lead couple could not be together were not solid in the last third of the series. The story dragged and became repetitive. You could probably skip 4 episodes in the latter half of the show and restart with episode 15 and you wouldn't miss much. This is typical of kdrama rom-coms, get the couple in love in first half of the series, slow to a crawl with obstacles in second half of the series, emotional payoff in the final episode.", "Full House is possibly one of the worst Korean dramas ever made and definitely the worst one that I've seen so far. The basic premise had potential, but the execution of it is awful.The two lead characters constantly argue with each other and call each other various names, the story line doesn't seem to go anywhere, some of the other characters in the series are greatly unlikable, the music is annoying and some of the clothing choices are horrendous. There is very little humour to be found in this series and so it ends up being quite bleak. I had to struggle to get through this series, whereas I've never felt that way with other shows. If you want to see a better romance/comedy series, try: Boys Over Flowers, Cinderella and Four Knights, Flower Boy Ramen Shop or Reply 1997.", "Not a big fan of these K-dramas, watch them more with the spouse as a window on the culture. The hammy acting, over-cranked \"action\", poor girl/rich guy(s), family values, no sex ingredients are all here. But this one is a weak effort, with far far too many minutes of silent angst/introspection by the four leads interspersed by either Han Ji-eun or Lee Yeong-jae storming out of the house they share and then returning for more. Seen on a weekly basis it must have been a hoot to wonder which one would be packing this time. Word to the wise - people have to talk on TV, it is more like radio, the screen is too small for big action or scenery, and there's none of that here, Shanghai and Seoul are seen in dull overcast skies. Watching people stare at walls while soft music tinkles in the background is, well, kind of boring. The story also has to move a bit on it's own, this one lurches ahead by having the two \"friends\" (...who needs enemies?)appear now and then to prod them on. A rare bit of wit in the script raises the score but overall a snoozer.", "*** Contains spoilers *** There are many interesting K-drama series shown on cable TV, but few are registered here. ROOFTOP ROOM CAT is the best I have seen so far. WINTER SONATA had a weak story, but amazing acting and a nice theme song. HOTELIER and JEWEL OF THE PALACE were on the boring side. MY LOVELY SAMSOON also had weak writing and no chemistry between the actors, although the leading lady had an endearing quality about her.The latest Korean TV series being offered in the USA is 2004's FULL HOUSE. The previews and promotions for FULL HOUSE advertise it as a fun comedy series. Comedy or not, an unrealistic setup is FULL HOUSE's fatal flaw. The first episode of FULL HOUSE makes BABYLON-5 seem like a documentary series. In FULL HOUSE, the leading lady believes she won a complex international travel package vacation with ZERO documentation. She does not call anyone to verify any details. The leading lady leaves for this one or two week international trip with only a one-way air ticket. Simply incredible. And even worse, the viewer is asked to believe that her real estate, her home, can be secretly sold (within a week's time) without her knowing. Property ownership is 9/10th's of the law. Real estate cannot really be sold from the trunk of a car.Assuming that a person's house was sold in a scam, any normal person would call the police so the police can come over to begin an investigation, and any normal person would start calling lawyers for help. No normal person would leave their house and physically go to a police station. No normal small unarmed young female would attempt to physically confront the thieves alone.The setup to FULL HOUSE is bizarre and unrealistic. But if a viewer is to accept the setup as being true, then the stranding in a foreign country and the loss of home, money and all personal property is tremendously sad and tragic. The average viewer wanting to enjoy a fun comedy series is going to be repelled by the major events in the first episode of FULL HOUSE. Also, an average viewer wanting to see a charming romantic story will be displeased by the cold and uncaring way the leading man treats the leading woman. Like MY LOVELY SAMSOON, the leading man shows no appreciation of female beauty. The leading man looks not at, but through, the leading lady with complete disinterest. Unlike J-dramas and programs from any other country, the leading men in MY LOVELY SAMSOON and FULL HOUSE constantly look at their leading ladies with contempt and annoyance and their behavior is cold and arrogant as if all females are unworthy of attention. If you are looking for a warm charming romance, look elsewhere.One last and less serious problem with FULL HOUSE is that the female that the \"famous movie star heart-throb\" leading man wants is very much on the nerdy looking side compared to the leading lady and, I am sure, any girlfriend he has ever had in real life. The love triangle is simply not that believable."], "1376": [], "1377": [], "1378": [], "1379": [], "1380": [], "1381": [], "1382": ["I liked this Korean drama very much. This movie is very brilliant if look at the plot and also the music. Kim Tae Hee did a very good job in playing as a medical students. I like the way Korean people pronounce English language.. Kim Rae Won was very outstanding but somehow he could improve. i don't like to talk about the story as it will not be surprised for those who haven't watched this best-ever love story. if compare to other Korean series like Winter Sonata, Autumn in my heart, or others, this movie still has its own identity. It was really something, may i suggest for those who still studying especially teens, you gotta watch as this movie will give you tips in studying overseas. As for the whole, this movie is really something, something that.. gotta watch ya!", "Love Story At Harvard is about the portrayal of the dream and love pursued by Korean students studying in Harvard. The drama demonstrates bright, hard-working, ambition, and romantic characters and story lines.A young love story set at the famed Ivy League school in the United States. Kim Hyun Woo,a 1st year law student at Harvard Law, enters into a rivalry with classmate Hong Jung Min for the affections of beautiful medical student Lee Soo In. The two men are both from prestigious families, while Soo In is from a poor family. This drama had a lot of promise considering that it was about foreign students at Harvard.I thought that this was going to happen in the U.S. and it will live up to the title about a romantic relationship in the Ivy League school.Unfortunately,that only happened in the first half of the drama.The other half happened in Seoul. Korean drama elements such as one of the lead characters having a terminal illness, a love triangle, the protagonist and the antagonist becoming friends and a happy ending took over. It became a clich\u00e9d drama just like any other Korean drama. Sad but true. The first part of the drama was great. The love story between Hyun Woo and Soo In was great. The classroom mock trial, the disciplinary council scenes, the classroom rivalry between Hyun Woo and Hong Jung Min,the experiences of law students at Harvard Law School and the development of all the lead characters were great in the first 8 episodes. Things went downhill when the story transferred to Seoul when expected Korean drama elements took over. When the storyline transferred in Seoul, the environmental case had a lot of promise. Unfortunately, it was underdeveloped. Also,the drama turned into low gear as the LOVE STORY of both Hyun Woo and Soo In became slow and OVER THE TOP in Seoul. Aside from that, the early law career of Hyun Woo become somewhat predictable. Also, the Soo In character in Seoul became somewhat weak as compared to the Soo In at Harvard. The female lead character became weak all of a sudden without any explanation whatsoever. There were also many unrealistic plots that were presented in the second part of the drama when all characters moved from Harvard to Seoul. It was just so disappointing that \"Love Story At Harvard\" had the promise to become an unforgettable and classic Korean drama.Unfortunately, this became an ABOVE AVERAGE Korean drama instead of a CLASSIC one. If the writers of the drama become more original and creative, then \"Love Story At Harvard\" would have become what \"My Sassy Girl\" is as a Korean movie.

It's similar to something along the lines of the \"Underworld\" movies, with (of course) mandatory various Korean love triangles.SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: A group of four creatures/beings have sworn to protect humanity against other beings from their own race. They consist of two men and two women who I guess are all Gumiho (or whatever their male counterparts are, since I've always known them to be female). Gumihos are nine tailed foxes who live a really long time, have powerful abilities and skills, and can take on human form. In this story, they once lived in harmony with humans in the distance past but were betrayed and soon driven to near extinction. They still live in small numbers in the present however, and many of them have a thirst for human livers in order to survive.Our good Gumihos, need to hunt down the bad Gumihos to keep the humans safe, and they need to this without the humans finding out about them. The four of them have varying skills and use different weapons to do their job (various swords and bladed arms and the like). They are also, naturally, all young and incredibly good looking, and each of them love one of the others in typical Korean melodrama fashion. The lone exception to all of these love angles between themselves, is one girl who gets involved with a human police officer. This cop gets assigned to a secret task force that's aware of the Gumiho's existence, and are trying to destroy them.There's too many story lines involved in this series. In addition to the cops, the good & bad Gumihos, the numerous love stories, and more, the main female charachter also happens to be a special kind of Gumiho that only comes along every 1000 years. She will soon have the power to unite or destroy the two races or something, but must be sacrificed at the next blood moon in order for this to be achieved. Some people want to destroy her, some want to protect her, and others want to use her to provide themselves with everlasting life. There's also ulterior motives between some of the good Gumihos, a traitor among them, some evil mastermind behind the bad Gumihos that has yet to be found, a special Gumiho killing weapon that the cop gets a hold of, etc. This was all a bit much, and I thought a lot of it was unnecessary; it only served to take the focus off the primary story(s).The stars did a decent enough acting job, but I've seen most, if not all of them, do much better jobs in other movies & shows. The production values drop off significantly after the first episode or two, and it starts to look pretty cheaply made at times. And, even though there are numbers of plot lines and stories involved, it gets bogged down during the middle to end of its run time, and becomes somewhat boring to sit through at times.This wasn't a terrible show, but it was not what I would call good either. I actually kind of like it some, but it just didn't hold up as being likable enough during its run time for me to fully recommend it.

Cha Mu-hyeok must be one of the most miserable roles in Korea drama. The chief actress is Su-jeong Lim. I have watched \"A Tale of two sisters\" before, her performance is perfect in that film, but I love \"Song Eun-chae\" more. She is so lovely in MISA.

First of all the scenery was winter which made it perfect for the characters to dress fashionably. The characters were also really cool. I liked the way the characters were all very extreme, and that there were no boring characters. You either liked the character in the drama or you hated their guts.

The storyline is unique and the acting by the two main leads are nothing short of outstanding. It focuses on a mother's love for her child and how human beings are inevitably, soft-hearted creatures.This Drama originally planned to be screened only for 16 episodes, the netizens of Korea demanded an extension and KBS complied by asking the drama's directors and producers to extend by another 4 episodes. However, the makers of the drama refused and said they couldn't and quite frankly, I'm happy they did. In fact, the drama was so popular that KBS even issued a second OST album for it due to overwhelming response. Not to mention that the last two episodes were so sad, that even the makers of the drama couldn't help but cry when the scenes were played out I don't have the vocabulary to describe So Ji Sup's performance in 'Misa'. I had watched him in 'Memories of Bali' and always knew that he was good. But this time he really outdid all of us.So Ji Sup is just perfect for Cha Moo Hyuk With comparisons to her co-star, I loved Im Soo Jung from top to bottom. She was very much what her character required to portray: A simple-minded girl without her own dreams. In the beginning, Eun Chae desired whatever Choi Yoon desired, because Choi Yoon was the epitome of her life. But once she got to know Moo Hyuk, that changed forever. \"I'm Sorry I Love You\" has a deeper meaning throughout the normal K-dramas we see about love. It dwells more on the humanity of a person", "I'm Sorry, I Love You (2004) was a 16 episode, huge television hit series made by Koreans, but popular all throughout the Asian world.Slightly soap-opera-ish in nature, it is an extremely addictive show because it develops its plot lines slowly and you really begin to care about the characters. The leads are all very attractive people (especially the awesome and incredibly handsome Ji-seob So as Mu-hyeok and the little dynamo Su-jeong Im, who was great in the Korean hit film A Tale Of Two Sisters), and their acting is realistic and evocatively emotional, and often funny as well. The music is beautiful too and the production values are excellent. It was filmed in Australia and Korea.It's the story of a petty gangster, Mu-hyeok - a street hustler growing up homeless in Australia, who is shot in the head at the wedding of a woman he loved. She was marrying a rich gangster for his money, yet Mu-hyeok, still deeply in love with her, risks his own life to save hers when an assassin shows up to kill the wedding couple.The doctors cannot remove the bullet in Mu-hyeok's brain, and they give him only a few months to live. The woman he saved gives him a lot of money and tells him to return to his homeland of Korea to die. He goes and makes a search for his birth mother whom he believes gave him up for adoption because of financial hardship. When he finds her he is shocked to discover she is rich, has another son, and so he doesn't reveal to her his identity but instead plans his revenge on her.Along the way he discovers he has a twin sister, and he falls in love with a gentle girl named Eunchae Song who works for his step-brother. Over time he begins a mellowing process. Will he cling to bitterness until the end of his life, or will he find the grace to forgive those he believed wronged him? Many surprises are in store for the viewer during this series, right up to the last scenes. There is also some wonderful humor to relieve the dramatic tension. I really loved this show and everyone I have recommended it to has become as hooked as I was! It's just as addictive as those famous British - PBS series such as Upstairs, Downstairs or The Forsyte Saga or The Duchess of Duke Street! Except the stars are all Korean! Now, there are several ways to buy this awesome series. You can order each episode off Amazon On Demand for $1.99 each, but the files have DRM copyright protection on them so you'll only be able to watch them on your computer. These are good quality files with excellent white subtitles in English.Or you can buy a 9 disc box set from KBSDVD, which is out of print now but worth tracking down because it has the best images (though the subtitles are not as good as the Amazon video files).Then there is another KBS release that is only 2 discs, but the images have been condensed to MPEG1 files instead of proper MPEG2 files, so I suggest you avoid this one. The yellow subtitles in this box-set are terrible in comparison to your other options. Ask the seller how many discs are in the set you wish to buy.Yet another box-set with 7 DVDs is available in Korea, but you're not going to find that selling here in the States because it is Region 3.However you track it down, don't miss it. It's literally the most addictive show I've watched in years and years. I love it! 10 stars out of 10.", "A soulful performance by the lead actor So Ji Sub makes this series worth watching. This could have been your average Korean melodrama however, the sincere, soulful and heartfelt performance by So Ji Sub elevates this melodrama to the highest degree. \"Sorry, I Love You\" is a journey of a young man who transforms from a minor vengeful petty thief into a decent caring human being. So Ji Sub's transformation throughout the series is quite remarkable, he displays great sadness and longing for love and acceptance. Lim Su-jeong who plays the unlikely love interest also gives a tender and genuine performance. Overall, the series has a rather karmic and dark message about \"whatever comes around goes around\". Su-jeong's father ends up suffering the most for giving up the twin babies and keeping the secret from the lead character's mother. It's not your average K-Drama the message of the drama is at the very end of the series. Great story writing and great acting by So Ji Sub makes this series one of the best K-Dramas. It's definitely worth watching.", "Please notice the spoiler alert. You do not want to read this if you haven't seen this wonderful show.As I have noticed in other Korean dramas, this one, too, attempts to tackle a social problem that arises in societies where kinship and social status based on family background are important. Here, too, we have fractured families with adopted, abandoned, widowed, or orphaned members. The only intact family is the one of the female lead (Song Eun-Chae, portrayed by the excellent Im Soo Jung), whose father bears the burden of holding the information that would have made the male lead (Cha Moo-Hyuk, played by the incredibly handsome So Ji-seob) stop hating his biological mother, and whose mother is a bitter shrew; so this family is outwardly intact, but inwardly fragmented. The search for family acceptance and love is paramount. Moo-Hyuk is a lonely and homeless outcast who preys on hapless female Asian tourists in Australia; his only emotional anchor is another Korean who marries a rich Australian for his money. As explained in another review, Moo-Hyuk gets to see Korea to find his mother during his last few months of life. Through a series of rather implausible events, he does find his biological mother, but also finds out -- erroneously -- that she abandoned him and a twin sister at birth. Bent on revenge, he focuses on whom he presumes to be his half-brother, Yune. He insinuates himself into Yune's life, almost lets him drown, watches as Yune's stylist (Eun-Chae) gets beaten up, and seduces Yune's girlfriend, until Yune loses his cool, gets into a car wreck, and is found to have a defective heart. When both Yune and Moo-Hyuk find out that they love the same girl, Eun-Chae, a terribly destructive struggle ensues that is centered on another Korean social value and thus problem: loyalty. Eun-Chae has grown up with Yune, has always been seen like a little sister by him, and is tied to him through her parents who work for Yune's mother, her own job working for Yune, and her secret crush on him. It is not until Moo-Hyuk intervenes that she realizes that she has choices in her life beyond those dictated by family ties and life history. It takes her a good amount of time, but after much agonizing, she finally chooses to be with Moo-Hyuk. He, however, cannot really set Eun-Chae free because he chooses not to let her come too close to him so that he can protect her from the certain heartbreak she would have to endure upon his impending death. Besides seeing So Ji-seob's and Im Soo Jung's superb acting, I enjoyed watching the character development of Yune (a supremely spoiled pop star), his mother (an egocentric woman clutching success), his former girlfriend (a nympho-manic starlet) and Eun-Chae's father (an unfailingly loyal chauffeur). All of them \"grow up\" by realizing their short-comings -- and it is through the homeless petty criminal Moo-Hyuk whose heart (!) was larger than theirs. Since Eun-Chae could not consummate her love with Moo-Hyuk, she commits suicide one year after his death, thus fulfilling her prophecy that they were not meant to be together in this life. I, too, grew from watching this story. My husband of two decades is here, not fatally injured, and we have sort of neglected each other's company. I better show him my love before we're in another world...", "This series is full of cliches but still somehow it tells a very special and realistic story that finds a way to touch your heart and God... hurts it!\nThe acting, chemistry between the leads and the soundtrack (snow flower) was all so good!The story takes you in and before you know, you are feeling that broken heart pain!

The level of love and respect they show each other, as well as the hilarious scenes highlighting their comedic abilities, are believably sugary sweet.

I think it's only thanks to the skills of Lee Byung Hun, that this series managed to be so good. Although there were also some genuinely mean performances by a couple of other villain characters, as well as a couple of slightly farcical and not so good characters.Usually, the romance thread is the main point of the Korean drama series. They introduced the fictional romance between Lee Byung Hun's character and that of Song Hye Gyo against the gangster backdrop. The 2 became real life lovers during the production of the drama - now broken up. You can see on screen that the two really like each other, but as for Song Hye Gyo's character of 'Angela' on screen, she didn't seem to have a lot of substance and I wasn't convinced why Kim In Ha should go nuts for her. You also have to believe in the nature of extraordinary coincidence - a common feature of Korean drama series - to be convinced that the couple should be reunited on SO MANY occasions in various parts of the world.For me, the stronghold of the series was the rivalry and backstabbing between the gang members. I especially cheered at the fate of the vampire-esquire Dae Soo character. Such a theme attracted a lot of male members to the audience - not something typical of most Korean drama series. I also think the series can appeal to many on an international level. They have on-location scenes in Las Vegas including some foreign actors.

I found the movie and it's engaging story-line to be very powerful.

The movie takes place in a world that most of us are simply not willing to face however the issues presented therein relating to abuse are very important and very relevant.Every action has consequence and truly each of our lives glow so bright before we fade.I hope that one day Breathless (Ddongpari) can be given a Region 1 DVD release so that I may purchase and watch again.", "'Breathless' revolves around the life of an abusive debt-collector named Sang-Hoon, an isolated and hateful person.

He insults and disrespects the boss (his friend) in front of the workers, he sometimes even punches his work colleagues, but he beats the hell out of every body else he encounters. Nothing seems to matter to him, he seems unstoppable, until he meets a senior high school girl who seems not to be afraid of him. Sang-Hoon, doesn't know that like him she has suffered domestic violence at the hands of her father, seems to appreciate and respect her attitude. They establish a friendship. Life changes...Breathless (original title: Ddogpari, which apparently translates as something like \"shit-fly\") is an unrelenting and uncompromising film from the very first frame. There are constant beatings and fights. Violence pervades every frame. The structure of the film seems repetitive, moving in circles, as if to mirror the circle of violence that the characters are trapped in. Yang Ik-Joon (writer, director, producer, and lead actor) has crafted a film that explores themes of domestic violence and its effects on people. The film seems a bit loose and unfocused in the middle but it is a powerful film for those who manage to reach the end.Extreme and brutal violence on screen. More swearing than Scorsese's Goodfellas. But a powerful first film with amazing performances from Yang Ik-Joon and Kot Bi-Kim playing the school girl with attitude.", "this is my first movie review in IMDb,usually I'm just a regular silent reader on this site, but somehow this movie Encourage me to write the reviews on it .. i first found this movie (again) on IMDb list Because its glowing review,but the first impression when I saw this movie not as nice as one might imagine, either because the lighting is less uncommon than the movie in general, unsympathetic character,etc.but somehow this movie finds me again, so Im kinda forced myself to watch it, probably thought I could use this movie as a \"sleeping pill\", remembering when I watched this movie at 3 in the morning ;p, but you know what? I end up watching this movie straight to end .. SLOWLY but sure it drags u into it .. its brutally honest, rude, raw and real .., sometimes in the middle movie Im thinking, \"is this a movie or a documentary?\" remember this film looks very real and not contrived, every character look alive, despite the main character's love interest from the beginning looked a little bit awkward, but ultimately they could co-exist .. brilliant performance by Kkobbi Kim! Made me wanna look at the films she starred ;), anyway even though sometimes there are ups and downs of the sympathy towards the main character, but that's what makes it look real and natural ..SPOILER ALERT: So far I have not had any problems with the movie that does not end happily, if the movie turns out to be sad ending, its fine by me.. as long as its believable. But for this movie alone, somehow I really wish the main character will eventually have a better life, a normal life, given he's been through a lot of bitterness of his life, although I got a feeling he has to pay what he did before.. and as predicted it ended like I didn't want to.. even though I'm disappointed, but maybe that's life, a reminder that its not a fairy tale, its real.", "Breathless is a bleak, relentless and emotionally raw movie from South Korea. An uncompromising look at the violent underbelly of a section of poverty ridden urban South Korea, Breathless is the directorial debut of lead man and scriptwriter Yang Ik-joon, and has rightly been bestowed with a healthy array of awards.As the films pace allows layers to build and relationship dynamics to be understood and interwoven, nausea and discomfort evolves into empathy and worry, characters you are sure are irredeemable surprise you. The shaky documentary style photography adds to the grittiness and rawness. Breathless is stark, dark and uncompromising. Well directed and with expertly judged emotional performances, this film has dared to expose the terrible unbreakable cycle of violence in an apparently progressive and evolved society. JM", "(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS) Arguably, extreme violence \u2013 or ultra-violence as Burguess would put it - has been one the most prominent traits of Korean cinema in the last decade, to the point that for many mainstream cinema-goers, it came to define it. The worldwide success and broad critical acclaim of Park Chan-wook revenge flicks, filled with gore and stylised perversity overshadowed the diversity of one of the most productive and inventive national film industries to create a stereotypical sub-genre: the extreme Korean thriller. Thematically, Breathless does not seem to disappoint the viewer's expectation: from the opening frame to the last scene, the film is relentlessly violent \u2013 but its depiction and meaning could not be more remote to Park Chan-wook's universe. Yang-Ik Jook, the director who also displays an impressive intensity in the leading role of his first feature, opts for a naturalistic approach to filming \u2013 all close-ups, simple shots and hand-held camera \u2013 light years from the complicated, westernised, post-Fight Club aesthetic of Park's vengeance trilogy. The epitome of Park Chan-Wook's visual style when dealing with violence can be found in Old Boy, with the infamous brawl in the jail corridor, where the lone hero overcomes one by one all his attackers in a virtuoso tracking-shot directly inspired by the beat-'em-up video games. Violence here is unreal: \"just fun\" - like in a Tarantino movie. In contrast, Sang- hoon, the main protagonist of Breathless, a debt collector spending his days beating to a pulp every single human being in sight, doesn't even know what a Playstation is (which he actually calls a \"Play-shit\"), until he agrees to buy one to his nephew, in a rare display of kindness. In a film saturated with symbols and totemic items (western child toys, knifes, phones, hammers), the introduction of the Playstation can be read as a departure from this insensitive, immature and virtual approach to the issue that is violence; and more specifically in Breatless' case, domestic violence. A moral tale about domestic violence and its consequences, the film reproduces the cyclical nature of child abuse. The bullied child becomes the bully; the victimised mother produces a traumatised daughter, a beating follows another beating and so on. This makes the film structurally repetitive and quite predictable, but remarkably, it also gives a forceful depth to the directors' hard-hitting argument about the responsibility that victims have in perpetuating the cycle originated by their tormentors. After an uncompromising first hour letting the viewer astonished and weary of Yang-Ik Jook shock and awe approach, the director suddenly introduces a sentimental edge to Breathless with an unexpected touching montage of the two main characters (the thug and the high school girl) taking the gangster's nephew to the fair, where he can, at last, be a child again. This passage, with its cheesy oriental music, is very reminiscent of Takeshi's Kitano similarly tender moments in his romantic gangster chronicles. This is also the only time, along with another pivotal twist taking place later on in the film (the father's suicide attempt), that Yang-Ik Jook uses mood music \u2013 the rest of the soundtrack containing only diegetic sounds of incessant kicking, punching, slapping and screaming noises, which provide, like a percussion set, the internal rhythm of the film.Littered with more swear words than a vintage Scorsese epic, Breathless, whose original title Ddjongpari could be translated \"fly-shit\", is also a study of the social alienation that comes with the lack of education that often originates in the trauma of child abuse: its main characters don't have the words to express their frustrations but only their fists and can only mimic what they have witnessed. Even marks of affections are sent through play-fighting (Sang-Hoon and his nephew) or verbal abuse (Sang-Hoon and the adolescent girl he calls \"crazy bitch\"). School education is regarded as important by all characters (the wannabe gangsters are always asked if they graduated from high-school by the mob boss) but remains a vacuous, distant, superficial dream, alien to their world of poverty and violence. The ending works superbly in a series of symmetrical narrative motifs, leaving room for hope as seen in the concluding flash-forward. The transformation of Sang-hoon is brutally quick, but remains believable. A martyr of child abuse, his will to change his ways and break the cycle will eventually kill him but save his family. It is a powerful conclusion to an overly brutal film that leave bruises like a punch in the face, but also handles its gentle moments with a disarming sincerity.More film reviews at ggendron.wordpress.com", "Ik-Joon Yang is the director, writer, and main actor in this movie. He produced this movie using his private money.The home of Yeon-Hue, the main actress, is Ik-Joon's renting house. After recording all scene in the house, he moved out from his home because his money run out and he needed his deposit in the house.He spent his every money to this movie, and fortunately this movie hits the 5rd best in the Korea indie movie history.

It is not that good, but neither is it that derivative. If anything, it favorably reminded me of the later TV work of Alan Clarke. Despite the summary above, it is not about characters seeking redemption, but family and solace from a cycle of criminal abuse fueled by misplaced ancestral reverence. Without giving away the end, it is more about insight gained by sacrifice that plays upon cyclical reincarnation themes than a solitary quest towards forgiveness.The multi-talented Yang Ik-Joon does a great job portraying a man so damaged that he expresses affection for a child by repeatedly shoving his head and calling him a bastard. Whether you find it disturbing or funny, the gradual manner in which the characters' darker and more intimate aspects are revealed is excellent.Instead of credulous explication, back-story or flashbacks, the relationships emerge out of frankly rude and often violent interactions which also advance the plot. I might have had a few gripes about the cinematography, especially in relation to scenes of violence. I kind of expected a bit more from Yang Ik-Joon in this regard. But for a film by an actor as first-time director/writer/editor/star, this is incredibly good.", "I haven't reviewed many titles but since it's 8 in the am and I'm watching it on silent (so not to wake my roommates) I figured I'd put my 2 cents in. Like I said, it's on silent and I'm only reading subtitles. Some of the scenes are so intriguing that sound seems unnecessary. I'm not really good at this but I can say that this movie sticks with you, probably for ever. This is why I say it's \"up there with Old Boy\". I watch, up to, 4 movies a day and sometimes I accidentally watch movies twice without realizing until the end, so when one sticks, it must be saying a lot for that film. The acting is impeccable, stylistically, it draws you in and as violent as it seems, it does hit a warm spot from time to time. Like I said, I'm no pro at film reviews but if you get what I'm trying to say, give this film a shot.", "BREATHLESS, a 2008 film from South Korean detailing the misadventures of a small-time debt collector and the relationships he strives to pursue, is a hard-hitting slice of social drama that takes casual violence to whole new level. It's clearly a heartfelt project from Ik-Joon Yang, who wrote and directed as well as taking the starring role. Yang is excellent in all three capacities.With a constantly profane script, a gritty level of realism throughout, and an entire lack of sentimentality, BREATHLESS is a thoroughly engaging piece of realist cinema. It has a cinema verite look about it, taking place on mean and run-down streets, and if some viewers find it depressing then that's because it strives to reflect real life rather than movie fantasy.Violence - in the form of beatings and slappings - comes thick and fast and there's so much of it that the viewer soon becomes as desensitised as the central characters, so that the latest punishment almost becomes expected. Yet the quality characterisations and the intermingling of lots of different characters' lives is handled expertly so that this is never less than riveting. It's a strong film indeed, one that's tough to watch at times, but once which explores the depths of the human condition that most movies dare not tread.", "Unfortunately some technical issues marred the supposedly powerful introduction where violence get unleashed by all characters on screen both physically and verbally. Clearly played from a DVD screener with the \"Showbox\" watermark, the audio was left silent for the good part of some verbal barrage, which to the prudish might seem like music to their ears.If there's one thing I learnt / have reinforced after the movie, is how ubiquitous the Korean swear word which sounds phonetically like \"shee-bal\" can actually be. It's more versatile than the English language's F-word, and the Korean one can be used to describe a whole host of bodily parts both male and female, with colourful adjectives strung together as well. Either that, or the person subtitling the show has some really colourful imagination to tag some appropriate swear words of his/her own liking, in order to spice up the dialogue for non-Korean speaking audiences.Breathless is almost like a one-man effort, with Yang Ik-June wearing a number of hats in producing, writing, directing and starring in the lead role of Song-hoon, a violent gangster who doesn't have to think twice when deciding to lay hands on his victims, and insulting them concurrently with his foul mouth. He's a debt collector in a small outfit which he co-founded, but finds more pleasure in being a field agent, bringing along underlings whom he can abuse as well, and show the ropes to, in teaching the essence of collecting money, and to show no mercy to those who cannot pay up.Most of the violence happen off screen, though the aftermath is seldom shielded in order to elicit a response from the audience. It actually makes for a great 3D movie with objects flying all around and at the screen, from furniture, to fists, and even spit, and I enjoyed the many unintentionally comedic moments that Ik-June effortlessly paints into his narrative despite the very negative elements of violence and language that pepper throughout, and almost every character was left tainted by dishing out, or be at the receiving end of bad signs or an uncouth mouth.I suppose the question here is, and the issue that Ik-June could have wanted to address, is that of violence, and domestic violence even, if a circumstances of a tragedy would lead to impressionistic youths turning to violence as a means of release and addressing their emotions. Or more directly, if being brought up in a violent environment would lead to the nurturing of violent tempers, given the lack of proper role models, and being unable to break out from the vicious circle as that painted in the film.Breathless may seem a little too long as it had attempted to give each character equal opportunity to shine, from the schoolgirl that Song-hoon befriends, to his boss, a young boy whom he takes as his own, and his mother, coupled with a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in the making. It's quite the complete story serving as a cautionary tale and a statement of the never-ending cycle, but would have benefited from tightening up the pace a little and could have gone under 2 hours. That said however, it did result in enough apathy given toward the characters here, given the anti-heroic stance they're all under, and you'll buy into its story of redemption toward the last act, and the fortification of the positive relationships that Song-hoon had, through his own violent ways, brought together.", "Yang Ik-June does a spectacular job writing, directing and starring as Sang-hoon in \"Breathless\". The almost pessimistic approach of the film is more complimented by its original Korean title \"Ddongpari\", which literally means \"Shitfly\".The film is said to be semi-autobiographical with inspirations for the story coming from the abusive childhood of the director. He even had to sell his house for the completion of this film, which shows how important this film was for him. The portrayal of raw violence in the film is so authentic and shocking that even while showing glimmers of hope the viewers are left with a pessimistic outlook towards the film. Almost in every single scene, there is some kind of use of cursing. The obscene language along with the violent and bloody nature of the film makes it a film that won't be suitable for every kind of audience. Full review at http://www.asianfilmvault.com/2017/08/breathless-2008- by-yang-ik-june.html", "Foul mouthed and violent and yet extremely conventional story of a collector for a gang that finds that things begin to change once he runs across a high school senior who won't put up with his crap. The pair bonds and become friends. We also meet the other people in their lives, his sister, father, nephew and friends; and her brother, father and teachers. It's an often funny occasionally shocking look at the violence we do and is done to us. Everyone in this film is damaged and a victim of some form of violence In most cases the tough guy stance of all of the characters is stripped away as they themselves are abused in others. It's the classic struggle of people to try and fight the violence in their lives or to go with it.Made as a poke in the eye to the Korean film industry by the star who felt he had nothing to lose (he wrote and directed). The film has won numerous awards around the globe and contains some very realistic violence and some raw performances. I can see how the film rocks some people's worlds (for all my reservations about the film it does have a definite power in its conclusion) but at the same time this is a rambling, often unfocused, film that seems very conventional. This is ultimately the story of an odd couple of misfits, neither whom belong really anywhere, who find some catalyst for change in each other. Granted this is set in their violent world where families abuse and even kill other family members, nonpayment of debts will get you hit in the head with a hammer or worse, and the slightest mood shift will end up with broken heads but it is at its (bleak but hopeful) heart a well worn story.To be honest I wasn't blown away. I liked the film a great deal. I love the performances, the two leads are stunning. I love the witty repartee between the characters, which is often very funny and real in the way that you bust on friends. But at the same time I found the film much too unfocused. I described the film in an earlier post as being the sort of thing that had I seen this on DVD I would have ended up watching some of it on FF. Its good, its just too long and too rambling.A note of sorts- of all of the films I saw at the New York Asian Film Festival this was the one film that I made the most notes concerning. Sitting in a restaurant after the film I scribbled numerous pages about the film and its meanings and the things it did, and now that it comes time to actually write it up I find that the film isn't worth elaborating on the numerous pages and that abbreviating them to the preceding entry was enough. Somehow 24 hours after seeing it the film no longer matters.Its worth a look, but not at the top of your list.Between 6 and 7 out of 10", "It is just a portrait of domestic violence , nothing more. Trying hard to appear dramatic , this film couldn't squeeze one single tear from my eye. Not only was the main character a completely asshole (altough the director was trying to convince us otherwise) the the story , by definition , was absent. Oh look the main characters a going on to buy some stuff ! Oh they are eating ! Oh now they are going home! Oh some short dialogue , involving as usually some insult. Oh look another scene of domestic violence. OH look they are going to drink. Oh look now they walk down the street! Oh look they cry! How interesting! Also the relationship of the main characters ,being the center of the story , was completely irrational. Some guy walking down the street and spitting on you then insulting you as slut all the time- I totally would like to befriend him! Definitely one of the most overrated films on IMDb.", "7,6 ratings. Really? I read all the reviews and I wonder what I missed? It must be in the second half of the movie than because in the first half of the movie there was nothing to see besides unnecessary cursing, unnecessary cheap violence, pretty bad acting, and a story that is going nowhere and that is beyond boring. Since I have the honor to be the first one to write a bad review I wonder if I have no taste at all and all the others have good taste, or is it me that has good taste and all the other reviewers are just wrong. I will never know the answer and I honestly don't care. I watched seventy minutes of Breathless, had to fight not to fall asleep, and I couldn't bring myself up to suffer another hour. So I just gave up watching this and did something useful instead of further wasting my time with this movie.", "This movie is about a faraway place were people get beat up kicked and spit on even family kids. If their really is a place like that wear nice people get beat up all the time I don't think I would like to live in a place like that even if my mother and farther had our house their.It has many bad words in it and even the kids say them.

I have recommended to my son and daughter to watch. The plot revolves around how a common girl could work in a palace as a palace girl, be bullied and because she was determined to learn, she overcame all odds to be the top of her palace girl career, but was derailed by many political opponents. Although framed, she came back via a different career path as a female doctor. All throughout her struggles, it was her reminders from her mentors that made her succeed, and on the verge of giving up, motivated her to try harder. As I watch the drama, it reminded me of the way corporate world works where competition will prevent you from moving up. This story has many plots and subplots, love and romance, and sacrifices. There are also funny moments acted out by Jang-Geum's foster parents. As the story unfurled, I learned many things about taking care of one's health and traditional Chinese (in this case, Korean) medicine, and about healthy cooking. It also gave me insight into how medicine works. Recommend that you watch the Korean dialog version,with English subtitles, or Chinese subtitles, as it gives you the emotions from the Korean dialog and insinuations.", "This is a popular Korean historical drama based loosely on a real-life woman who became the King's personal physician. This was during a time when Confucian rules were extremely strict and patriarchal, so it was very unusual for a woman to attain such a high position. The show's writers used the bare historical framework available and heavily embellished it to construct a wonderful drama.Jang-geum is the daughter of fugitives; she is orphaned at an early age. She enters the royal palace as a palace maid, and begins training to be come a court lady under the tutelage of Lady Han. However, the palace is rife with the machinations of the evil Lady Choi, until Jang-geum and her mentor are finally sent into exile. Jang-geum finds another career path and is able to re-enter the palace as a physician lady. Of course, there is a love interest: the handsome and noble Sir Min who unconditionally supports Jang-geum's career ambitions at his own expense. Women figure prominently both as plotting against Jang-geum and helping her. There are a few touches that remind one of a Gothic novel, such as the occasional vision of those who have passed away.This is a wonderfully compelling show full of lovely costumes, sets, scenery, cinematography. The makers obviously set out to show Korea in all its beauty and miss no opportunity to place a mountain in the background. I believe real palaces were used in some of the shots, and these are beautiful as well.The show is also rather wholesome, and I mean that in the best sense possible. The virtuous heroine is eventually rewarded for her good character - her courage, loyalty, strong work ethic, desire to help others. There are absolutely no sex scenes or revealing clothes - a bare foot seen for one second is as suggestive as it gets. In this day and age it's refreshing to see a TV drama that can be wholesome without being sappy. Somehow, Jang-geum and Sir Min's long romance is the more beautiful because they aren't allowed to Be Together.Anyone who has enjoyed Jane Austen adaptations, Gothic novels, and other story lines with a long-suffering heroine struggling with class prejudice, sexism and the plots of other women will certainly enjoy this. As long as you don't mind subtitles and can find a subtitled version, you'll be fine. The Chicago Korean TV station aired this with subtitles, and Yesasia is promising to release an English-subtitled DVD set later on this year. Google \"Jang-geum forum\" to find English-speaking forums that will answer a lot of your questions regarding the show.Seek this out, it's a hidden treasure.", "This is the first time I have written a comment on IMDb in all the years I have used it avidly to search for worthy videos to watch. I am writing it not because there is not enough comments already for this wonderful series, but to additionally help you decide if you should invest a whopping 54 hours of your life on watching one drama! Since this is aimed at convincing you why you should watch it, I will keep spoilers to a minimum.So how did I get involved with it? I was searching for worthy Korean TV series to watch after having seen the more contemporary setting drama such as Stairway To Heaven, which is highly recommended. When I came across this, although rated highly by others, I shy-ed away from it for the same reason above ... I just couldn't imagine how this kind of drama can entice me. But...someone I know asked if I have it to lent them due to the fact I told people I watched Korean Drams. I did not in spite of my collection of top DVD titles. I decided to get it just to find out what it was all about. At the time, IMDb did not have this title rated to assist in my decision.Episode one was interesting. Not hooked but enough interest to keep me going...same with the next one...and then when I finally got to the part when the little Jang Geum became orphaned and out-shone the other little girls in the palace in her determination and diligence, that is when I really got hooked, which brings me to a suggestion ... watch the first 3 episodes in their entirety. If you are still only on the sideline not sure to continue or not after watching episode 3, then you should probably stop watching (really unthinkable to me but I suppose it is possible). The actors/actresses are handsome/pretty, but that is not why I continued.The first set of DVDs I purchased was made in China and had OK English translation. The problem with the English translation, while subtle, surfaced more in the second half, as one can tell they are not done by the same person(s). An anal movie-buff that I am, I sold it and bought the YesAsia edition, more expensive but has much better translation (a very prominent example would be: Palace Girl in the China Edition is Court Lady in the YesAsia edition -- while Palace Girl is the \"literal\" translation, the proper equivalent by title is Court Lady). The picture quality is also better. In fact, my wife commented that Jang-Geum (grown up) is not as pretty as in the China version now that she can see the imperfections on her face close up.... So I ended up spending yet another 54 hours re-watching...but it was worth it...because the translation clarified things that otherwise would have been lost as \"cultural differences.\" This is the set that will remain in my library as one of the rare \"worthy\" TV dramas to collect in its original form. By the way, the China edition in the green box has bonus materials of interview with some of the cast members as well as the last 7 days of filming -- even though there is no English subtitle on the bonus materials, it was still quite enjoyable to see how the cast looked in \"modern\" attire and their reaction to the questions! :)With so many TV programs trying to \"buy\" an audience with \"sex, violence, and improper language (lack of respect)\" screen time nowadays, it is truly refreshing to see something that not only serves to entertain but also educate at the same time without emphasis on sex and violence! It is little wonder that this series has swept away audiences all over and realigned some of the younger generation to the ideals that seem to be eroding away in the modern world.In closing, none of the episodes disappointed and they were all enjoyable, but it is just a small few minutes here and there of extra details that seem to drag a bit in the first 10 episodes. In fact, I have a feeling that if you are KOREAN you will probably not feel the drag due to your ability to relate those details better than non-KOREANs like me.The quality of research that has gone into making this production (the cuisines and the medicines) is impressive and educational. The music - excellent. Combined with the singular vision of one director and one writer for this drama, it is a COMPLETE experience that, in short, will enrich the lives of anyone who is open-minded and willing to invest the time to watch it.Please let me know if my comment is helpful to you.

From then on, it had got me intrigued.Based on the life of the first ever woman royal physician in the now Korea, it will definitely pull your heartstrings and move you. The age-old philosophy of perseverance and facing whatever adversaries no matter how big or small is dominant in this drama serial.Lee Young-Ae plays the role of Jang Geum very well. So do the other cast members as well. Those who play the evil court ladies are really so convincing that it made me forgot for a moment that it is only just a show.The spread of food being shown in the drama serial can really make you go mouth-watering. You will be surprised as to why each dish has its own significance and all that. The medical knowledge that Jang Geum has later on in the serial is really impressive but then at times, it got her into trouble as well. But she always persevered and save the day. The scenes with Lord Min are always very sweet and romantic.In this current age and times where the traits Jang Geum possesses really make people try to understand more of the world they are in, this show is definitely a winner. Virtually almost no sex is involved here and this is something Asian societies has been waiting for a long time, given our culture can be conservative at times. But as long as anyone is interested in checking out this drama serial, you need to find out first whether there's dubbing and/or subtitles involved if your local TV station is showing it. Chances are there will be, given the original language is in Korean.

I do too.", "Jang-geum's story is engrossing, as other comments have noted, for all sorts of people. Very inspiring for its central moral drama, it is also full of great incidental historical and cultural information. The lead, Yeong-ae Lee, as Jang-geum, is a fine, subtle actress; here's hoping she will appear in more films. Since she apparently was part of the jury at 2006 Berlin Film Festival she should have a wider world cinema audience. Also, the English subtitles are exceptionally well done, but I regret that they don't give English language production information. Those writers, directors, producers and actors deserve to be honored. It is good that IMDb lets us fans research this, though. Thanks IMDb and commenters, too!", "This is the best thing I have ever seen for the big screen or small screen. It is a semi-historical costume drama depicting the life of Jang Geum, a Korean girl/woman/lady of the 15th century. If you are partial to long, involving stories, I think you will like it too. Although it is episodic in nature, it is important to see it sequentially from the beginning to appreciate the story to the fullest. This story is shamelessly sentimental at times, but pulls it off very well. There are no special effects worth mentioning, no sex, no graphic violence and no snappy dialog. In short, this would never be made for U.S.A. viewing. In spite of this, I am sure that it will find a loyal audience. With so many movies and television shows being made according to formula, it is refreshing to see something that is counter-formula and done so well.", "(Just finished the series in S.F./Oakland bay area channel 32 - KMTP (KMTP).

You can imagine how Hollywood would have protayed this.(Dr quinn medicine woman anyone?)But when you watch the show..this story fades quickly into the background. Instead you are taken into life of young Jang Geum at the korean royal court and the daily workings of the kitchen and later medical/hospitalside.This show has more a feel of a reallife documentary than that of a movie. I guess thats why this show and all other korean show is so good. They know how to make this show as realistic as possible....that you aren't exactly an audience anymore. But it's like you are watching someones real life. It has a feel of watching something like big brother show...but than with a (good) script. :) I", "When my wife suggested I watch this show I never expected to get sucked in by what looked like a Korea, costume drama, soap opera, but I was so wrong. I started watching this show on TV Japan a few months ago - dubbed in Japanese and without English subtitles - yet in spite of the language issue I was able to quickly follow what was going on in the story. Recently they have begun showing Dae Jang Geum on our local Korean station in the original language with English subtitles and now the show is even more enjoyable. A great story. Great characters and lots of food that constantly sends my wife and I off to our local Korean BBQ.Basically the story starts before Jang Geum is born and follows her from childhood and up through out her life. She goes from being the child of fugitives on the lam, to kitchen apprentice/lady in waiting in the royal household, to outcast on an island prison, to the first woman doctor to the King of Korea.The Palace is a genuine snake pit of intrigue and the trials do take their toll on Jang Geum - she changes and grows and is shaped by the influences of his friends and enemies alike and yet still she manages to retain her essential spirit.What I like most about this show is that Jang Geum is the true hero of the show, whereas her male love interest remains only in a supportive role. This is a great show and worth watching.", "I am a fan of DJG/ Dae Jang Geum/ Da Changjin. A huge one! Last year, I watched those movies on ch 55, avoiding DJG at all costs, because one of my friends told me,\"So ancient...don't watch!\" One night, I was bored out of my brain. I switched to ch 55, and guess what was playing- DJG. Since I was so bored, I decided to watch anyway(This is the one when the miso tastes funny; in a bad way, so Jang Geum and Han Sang Goong investigates). And holy crap: I was drawn to it. I stared at the TV until the end, and I was officially HOOKED.Every night, I watched watched watched... even 'preaching' to my friends about it. The friend who told me not to watch it was also hooked. In fact, practically my whole class was hooked.This drama series is both funny and soul touching. Lee Young Ae is a great actress; it is undeniable. Choi Pan Sool, the merchant who monopolized the palace's goods, has such solid acting that every time I see him angry, I feared that he would burst a blood vessel! Truly memorable.This is about the story of Jang Geum, a palace maid who is an orphan, but adopted by Kang Dook Gu and his wife, 'Qiuxiang', I assume (It is later mentioned that when Jang Geum's house was raided by Yin Mojie's men, all letters were taken, and all of them were love letters from Kang Dook Gu to his wife, and the letter always starts with 'Blah blah blah Qiuxiang'. That part is HILARIOUS). She is exceptionally bright and goes under the wing of Han Sang Goong. However, due to Chois' meddling, the two were exiled to Jeju island as slave-servants, in which Han Sang Goong died on the way. Jang Geum then trained to be a Medical Lady, because it was the only way a slave-servant can enter the palace. After much work, Jang Geum manages to re-enter the palace and meet up with her old friends. But when Choi Sang Goong and her gang find out, they try in vain to drive Jang Geum out. During the time Jang Geum was a Medical Lady, she contributed much, and in recognition of her work, King Jungjong bestowed on her an official title. She was the first and last woman to gain an official title and be the King's principal physician. However, in the end, she chose the path of a commoner. Waaaaaaa.......I wish she didn't.Leaves you wanting more, doesn't it?", "i only watched jewel in the palace out of curiosity. it was highly advertised as \"phenomenal\" and \"record breaking\" in the Philippines. i watched the first few episodes and got interested enough but a rival show got my attention more.but my mom, dad and brother were hooked! it finally came to a point where my mom borrowed the disk set from a friend so she can catch up on the episodes she missed. well. they were there and i had nothing else to do so i watched it.I'm kinda young so i thought it most probably wouldn't float my boat. but surprisingly, i saw myself waking up day after day watching at least 3 episodes of Jewel in the palace.it was interesting cause no one ever dislikes watching prodigies at work. and that's what janggeum is.. it's just a plus that she's really pretty and has a good heart etc.seriously, if i watched this on TV it would've driven me crazy. good thing for DVDs! :D the universal appeal that it claims to have seems to be in the fact that it is entertaining, educating and practically without sex and violence. a few fist fights here and there and a truckload of back stabbings, schemings and conniving but not very much blood, gore and general things-that-would-make-your-kid-hit-other-kids.i haven't finished the entire series but because the TV show is ending here in the Philippines, i already know what's going to happen.it's a great show to learn from: cooking, medicines, values and standing up for what is right.. all that blah.apparently, it was well researched and is based on true events.. and who doesn't like that? dae jang geum was the first (and possibly only) personal physician to the king. and that was even after a few death threats and several frame ups. mostly, it's an inspirational story about not giving up\"She is like wild grass.

I have never seen anything better come out of Hollywood. I'd have to give this 15 stars out of 10! \"Yi Dong\" is another epic tale worth watching if you like this.. or if you liked yi dong then jewel in the palace is even better! Wow! what an epic classic!! I will watch this again for sure. \"Jewel In The Palace\" / \"Dae Jang Geum\" got me hooked on Korean drama! what a find! .. i thought i had seen everything the tube had to offer.. then i find Korean drama! wow!!!!!! These Korean drama's only come with subtitles.. but few episodes in.. i don't even notice them. With subtitles however you should try to watch when there are few distractions.. careful tho.. one or two hours in.. and you start to get addicted!", "I don't write reviews, but it is criminal how unknown this show is where I live (the U.S), and how dead this IMDb page is. So, I am hoping, with a little luck, to convince some people to give it a shot. This show deserves a much larger fan-base on my chunk of the globe.I am writing this with people who have never seen a historical Korean Drama in mind. I will try to give an idea of what the show is like to watch.It may not be for everyone. It is heavy on pathos, which can be great; but such a thing can, at times, come off kinda cheesy (though it is much worse in other Korean dramas). Still, I think it is handled pretty well in this show.Also, if you are new to this genre, you will be thinking, \"Why do they keep showing me flashbacks of things I just saw three minutes ago?\" So, some patience may be required at times.The shows that are most popular in the U.S. have pretty much nothing in common with this show (not putting them down, just trying to illustrate how different this show is from what people in my country are used too). It isn't about superheros, long-brewing or off-again on-again romances, love-triangles, or case-solving (though there are plenty of deaths). There are no special effects, hardly any fight scenes. The scenes that are funny are usually just goofy characters acting goofy. Don't expect the great humour we are used to from the best comedies out of the U.S and U.K. Which, should probably be expected, this isn't a comedy after-all. What this show DOES have is a relatively non-complex, intelligent, brave protagonist who is pure of heart through and through, making her way in a world filled with plenty of people willing to do whatever it takes to maintain or gain political/financial power. There are political intrigue, rivals, and friendships. The story is very detailed and it covers a lengthy time-line. The narrative is all determined by the writers from the onset; it isn't a show that just keeps coming up with new episodes until viewer interest wanes. You know how novels adapted to movies always feel so rushed? Well, this isn't based on a novel, but it feels like someone decided to just film a whole novel instead of shortening it to a 120-minute movie (it is over 50 hours). It also provides a high level of escapism due to the detailed immersion into early 16th century Joseon (Korea before there was Korea) through the use of locations/sets, costumes, customs, cultures, etc.I know I didn't explain much how the plot goes, but that is mentioned in a bunch of other places. I am just trying to give a feel for what watching this show is like.This might be the show I have enjoyed more than any other. I recommend, at least, giving it a shot.BTW, The show can also be found under the anglicized title, \"Jewel in the Palace.\" Unfortunately, IMDb review guidelines prohibit me from telling you were this show is available for free, legally, with no copyright infringements. A show like this can be hard to find, unless you know where to look already.", "This was my first K-Drama .If you love learning about different cultures then this is best start to know Korea and its great culture . We all have heroes and their great stories of achievements, but rarely we know about there struggle . This is a serial worth watching because in this you will walk the path of being something via hard work and rock-determination .It will give you hope ,inspiration and faith . As a drama acting ,costume ,dialogue,script and presentation is superb .Even though most part of story is fictional but it is very close to reality .The depth of characters and there emotions ,relationships and struggle is well presented . Storyline revolve around \"How a little girl looses her parents and with this grief how she work hard to become the finest in whatever she do \". Each and every episode will teach you something and you will just fell in love with the characters ,even one with grey shades .It also has one of the best traditional Korean title song with amazing lyrics .A beautiful triangular love story and a wonderful lesson . A must watch .", "This is my all-time favorite drama! The OST is absolutely amazing. The plot is captivating, the acting is outstanding, and the actors are well fit for their roles! This drama is so colorful and inspiring in every aspect, and it represents, especially to me a different Korea, a different way of life. The storyline displays Korean way of living in the 16th century, and emphasize an ancient culture. The culture of royal court cuisine, traditional medicine and outfits. Dae Jang Geum's determination, courage and kindness make her a model for imitation. A girl that becomes a woman, a chef, a first female royal physician and a mother despite all hardships. Min Jung Ho's devotion and faithfulness throughout the whole drama, make this to be one the best love stories ever!If you have yet to watch this drama, make sure you do so!", "this series is stunning in every way..the story of Suh Jang Geum, the first woman to ever become the personal royal physician is a gripping story with more plot twists than a plate of spaghetti. the series follows Jang Geum's life in and out of the royal palace in 16th century Korea. Without giving anything away, i just want to say i found the characters very inspiring, as well as entertaining. from a production point of view, the beauty of the sets/costumes, art-dept stuff, the acting from all the major characters was incredible, the story was completely fascinating and the characters were just awesome. if this is the stuff they get to watch in Korea, i'm jealous. i'm thinking of moving. Also, on the DVDs i got (3 box set Korean produced) the English subtitles were really good. which, as someone who mostly watches non-English language movies, is a HUGE point in their favour!!", "I remember I watched this series back when I was still in high school. I was impressed by it. The series talks about the struggle of a brilliant woman in Joseon era where her identity as a woman defined her function in society. The characters was just lovable and believable. The casts have good acting and the scenery is beautiful. I re-watched it again recently and honestly, I never get bored of it. The main reason is because I can relate to Jang-Geum's story where her passion, kindness, and determination led her to be a successful woman in her times. The supporting characters also play significant role to the story and their conflict was presented well. The drama has quite long episodes, but for me this is the best historical drama about a regular person in the palace (where the main leads are not an heir to the throne dealing with power and political conflict). It is a heartfelt story that was executed in an awesome way.", "it was the first historical Koreean series who I saw. and this first contact remains, after more a decade after it, real significant. because it was the best introduction to an exotic universe. because the simple story about the success of a poor young lady has the flavor of spices and food and medicine and lovely costumes and dramatic events.Lee Young-ae is the best choice for the leading role and the explanation remains very simple - more than a nice girl , she gives to her character a subtle and delicate, impressive and fascinating force , remembering the heroes from legends. or, maybe, Soviet Unions good guys. a series about the small things in soft and charming manner. so, a n aesthetic gift and a beautiful story.", "I watched Dae Jang Geum from DVD. I was more convince by my best friend Jory . i had always associate Yeong-ae Lee with a sort of saccharine , sweet piety but watching it showed a different side and made me admire her deep humility, a virtue that is strange to us now a days, Yeong ae Lee infuses her character with beauty , wit, and intensity. I personally enjoyed the period of settings, customs, \" Cooking demo\" colorful costumes, etc. as well as finding the character believable and engaging. I recommend this film to anyone of any age, who is looking for uplifting, true story , that will make you laugh and cry ones in a while..Mabuhay!!", "I watched \"Dae Jang-geum\" from DVD's. Since I don't understand Korean and don't know how to change language with my DVD player, I watched the drama in Korean with English subtitle. The subtitle is OK from the first to the 16th DVD. But the second half (from the 17th DVD) the translation is terrible. I guess someone not good in English did the translation from a Chinese script, because I could kind of figure it out from the words as what they could be in Chinese. For example:look like (or seem to be) ... translated as \"elephant\" (same character as image in simplified Chinese) very likely ..... translated as \"good elephant\" Queen Mother ..... translated as \"stepmother\" (queen and later are the same character in simplified Chinese) (Your/His) Majesty ..... translated as \"On the top\" (or \"On the\")Yes ..... translated as \"Is\"I am..., You are...., translated as \"I is....\", \"you is.....\",what to do ..... translated as \"f--k what\" (the very bad word)the Queen ..... translated as \"Positive Palace\"Jang-geum..... translated as \"long now\" (the name in Chinese characters)There are grammar errors in almost every sentence. Most audience may not pay attention to these mistakes. But for people like me and my children to read English subtitle is the only way to understand the story. Please check the subtitle before you release the DVD's or broadcast the series in an English speaking country. Thank you."], "1429": ["Damo is a Korean TV period melodrama from around 2003 or so. It goes by a few other names as well: Damo; The Undercover Detective, Female Detective Damo, etc.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: It's Joseon era Korea, and various law enforcement factions throughout Korea are looking to rid the country from crime and corruption. This story focuses on the daily inner workings of one of the state police sections, which include 2 of the 3 primary characters of this series. One of these characters is the handsome, young, righteous police commander played by Lee Seo-jin. The other character is the \"Damo\", who is played by Ha Ji-won.A \"Damo\" is a low level police servant, who is usually from a less than stellar upbringing and is of poor social status. However, this particular \"Damo\" has become a highly skilled, smart, ambitious, loyal, likable, ass kicking, beauty. As such, she soon rises from a nobody to a trusted & respected member of the police force. She's done all she can in life to get ahead on her own, but, much of her accrued knowledge, abilities, and current status are due specifically to her section commander, who took her under his wing when she was a young orphan, and helped her become who she is in the present.Ha Ji-won is soon sent undercover to infiltrate a band of thieves; there she meets their leader who's the 3rd primary character involved in the story (played by Kim Min-joon). Like the police commander, he's also a handsome, righteous, young man, except he operates on the opposite side of the law. He's not a bad guy per se however; he's more of a Robin Hood type who fights for the people, and helps the poor and sick from being marginalized and mistreated by the powers that be.Being a Korean melodrama, the 2 male leads fight for what they believe is right, while they compete for the affection of the female lead in some fashion or another. There's also the sibling angle at play here as, unbeknownst to everyone, the Damo is actually (SPOILERS) the long lost sister of the leader of the thieves. In addition, the police commander is sort of a surrogate brother to the Damo, as they've spent much of their lives growing up and living & working together. From there, it's just a matter of which of the two leads will win out, and which man the Damo will choose to side with in the end. I liked this show pretty well overall, and, it holds up surprisingly well even a decade after it aired. There's a fair amount of swordplay and wire-fu involved on occasion, and although the budget couldn't have been too enormous, the action rarely looks overly silly. The 3 main leads all do a solid job, as do several other secondary cast members. And, the story is fairly interesting and quickly paced for the most part over its 14 episode run time.One of the better aspects of this show is that the 2 main male leads are both treated fairly equally. These are both mostly honorable men, and this makes it difficult for the Damo to decide which side she wants to be on. The story, smartly & effectively, never lets you clearly delineate which side (& man) is right and which side (& man) is wrong.One of the more odd aspects of this story, is that it occasionally tends to want to be a romantic love story. The police commander begins to fall in love with the Damo, but she is somewhat of an adopted little sister to him. The Damo begins to fall in love with the leader of the thieves, but he is her actual brother. I guess one could argue that's just the way it was in that era in regards to the commander/Damo relationship, and since the Damo didn't initially know the thief was her actual brother, it provides an excuse for her to begin to fall for him. Nevertheless, I found this dual sibling vs love interest angle bordering on being a little creepy at times. One more thing, please stop with the female fighter disguising herself as a man in various Asian martial arts period pieces. You can cover up a girl's hair and rub dirt on her face all you want, but it is impossible to mistake any of the actresses they typically do this with (and Ha Ji-won is no exception) as anything other than beautiful women, in any time period.This show has a few minor problems here and there, but what KTV melodrama doesn't?...All in all though, it is enjoyable and entertaining enough to recommend. It flows along pretty well throughout, it's written well enough to get the job done, and, it's not afraid to do what they wish (dramatically wise) to one or more of the characters you've invested in by the time it all wraps up.With all due respect to the other 2 IMDb reviewers of this show to date; A) this is not a 10 star watch by any means or rational, and, B) the other reviewer completely misunderstood how the Damo and her brother ultimately resolved their story line.It's plenty watchable though. A rock solid 7 out of 10 stars in my opinion!", "Damo is an excellent, well paced Korean drama set in ancient Korea. It has a great cast (some character roles are comically intense), over the top (if somewhat low budget) special effects, and plenty of emotion if you let the drama suck you into its world. The story is surprisingly violent in some scenes, so watching it with young children might not be advised. Also it should be noted that doing some research into ancient Korean culture might aid in explaining some of the cultural trends and rules present, as the drama might not always explain itself, however this doesn't detract from the story. It is not nearly as long as some of the dramas out there, so it can be finished in a reasonable amount of time, or you can cram it into an all night session if you can't get enough.", "Damo, a historical kdrama set in Chosun era, is centered around three compelling characters who are pigeon-holed by society and strain to change society to allow a new paths to be taken to fulfill their dreams. Chae-OK (central character), is a damo (servant) for the police and amazingly also a police investigator. How could she have this role in a society that valued her only as a possession? Hwangbo Yoon, the police captain, is her childhood friend/protector and facilitates her investigator role. When the police are assigned to crack a counterfeit coin case, Chae-OK volunteers to go undercover to investigate a gang of rebels. Here Chae-OK meets Jang Sung-baek, the rebel leader, who dreams of a society that is not ruled by class but equally by all the people. His dream draws Chae-OK like a moth to a flame. Her struggle to choose between the two men plays out as the plot thickens and the woven web draws them to a fated climax. What I loved about this drama: 1) Chae-OK is smart, determined, fearless, and headstrong. She is one of the strongest women characters I've seen portrayed. 2) Equally appealing male leads. A. Hwangbo Yoon was steadfast, honorable, and loyally loved only Chae- OK. But society would never allow Chae-OK (a servant) to be in a sanctioned relationship with Hwangbo Yoon (a higher class). B. Jang Sung-baek, was a visionary with a passion for a free society not ruled by class. His new world would provide Chae-OK opportunities not possible in current society. 3) Supporting characters that contributed. There were no dead weight characters in the supporting cast. I secretly loved Officer Lee with the dashing scar. 4) Appropriate Ending. I agreed with the writer's choices, it could end no other way for these three characters. What I did not love: 1) Wire-work fighting style was over-the-top unrealistic and off-putting. It literally defied gravity. I prefer a hand-to-hand sword fighting style (e.g. Chuno, Warrior Baek Dong Soo). 2) Pacing was ponderously slow in many episodes. 3) Why can't characters have a complete conversation? So much agony could be avoided if complete conversations took place. You can make this claim for many kdramas as misunderstandings are major plot drivers. 4) Turns out that Chae-OK's headstrong ways were selfish at times and the risks she took had a ripple effect of negative consequences for many other characters.", "Beautiful performance by Ha Ji-won. But I was troubled by the following. (1) Why did the captain take so long to tell Jang, that Chai was his sister. Was it because he wanted him to kill him, so that he wouldn't have to kill the brother of the girl he was in love with. (2) Jang was too quick to believe that Chai would have been involved in the massacre of the lepers. He had spent enough time with her in the cave to know, that she wasn;t the type of person to do something like that. Even if he did believe it, it wasn't in his nature not to have looked in her eyes before he killed her. Obviously the idea was to make him believe he had killed her. but what happens if he ran into her afterwards. If it had been me, i think it would have been better to have threatened the life of the rebel girl. (3) When Jang finds that Jai is alive, after he was supposed to have killed her, he doesn't seem too surprised(4) The ending. It didn't get the tear ducts going. Maybe because, I knew that it was going to be tragic, But as far as I could see, she still stabs him, even after she finds out that he's her brother. Okay. maybe, she was just too blinded with the idea of revenge against the man who killed the captain.Anyway, here's my ending. The captain is not dead. He finds out that Jai has gone to kill her brother. As she delivers the death blow, he (the captain)cries out that he's her brother. But it's too late. She cries in anguish, and finally kills herself.Oh, one other thing. The wuxia element. Exciting enough to watch. But in relation to Jai, because I can only think about in relation to her. Sometimes she used it, and sometimes she didn't. Was it only effective in certain hours of the day or what? :)"], "1430": [], "1431": ["I love this drama very much. Every teenager plays a role.

Views are offered in and around the cockpit bubble, sometimes slowed down for somewhat comical staring of daggers between opponents. There's the usual dogfights between planes - having the F-15 do battle against its arch-rival the MiG-29 - is pure delight for any combat aviation fan, and if my eyes didn't play tricks on me, look out for the MiG's fabled cobra maneuver - I'd almost jump out of my seat with disbelief and glee when that happened.Soar into the Sun has a whole host of arsenal deployed and missions to fulfill, such as air-to- air, surface-to-air, air-to-surface missiles, anti-aircraft guns, and missions from routine patrols, infiltration, and search and rescue all making it one holistic look at the workings of an air force. And what's more, not only do fighter pilots get in on the action, but attention being paid to the ground technical crew who keep the planes in tip top condition in between sorties, as well as ground commandos in extraction missions using their fixed wing aircraft, trained to rescue pilots who are downed behind enemy lines - and yes, this is yet another subplot that managed to find its way into the narrative, based on the John Moore film in 2001 starring Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson in his rare outing as an action hero.Rain completed this film before heading toward his obligatory national service, and here he plays hotshot (what else?) pilot Jung Tae-Hoon, who's the youngest in the acrobatic Black Eagles team, flying the FA-50/T50 Golden Eagle (flown by Indonesia and South Korea's air force only), which is a trainer and multi-role fighter. But his decision to spice up a routine air show wasn't appreciated, and he also becomes the fastest to get sacked from the acrobatic team, being redeployed to an operationally ready squadron because its commanding officer believes that his talent with an aircraft shouldn't be gone to waste.What is probably unheard of if this is done by Hollywood, is to admit that the main protagonist isn't the perfect all rounder he is. It's established early on that Tae-Hoon is the specialist in low flying, so he isn't quite cut out, as scenes would prove, that he's dogfight material. so this means Rain having to step aside and share the limelight with Yu Jun-Sang as Major Lee, who is their squadron's ace. And although the F-15K variant here is obviously the aircraft of choice and the superior fighter in the film, it's a nod toward Korean pride to have its lead fly the FA-50/T-50 Golden Eagle for his final, all important mission that delivered the payload.The money shot is of course what you've caught a glimpse of in the trailer, where two F-15s are hot on the heels of a MiG-29, or at times, vice versa, as they storm through the skyscape of Seoul. The stunt and visual effects team did a great job to create that urban battle scenario, and yes I'm raving about that cobra maneuver again. Aerial combats in the film are sleekly choreographed, and the brownie points come in watching this in a theatre with optimal sound, because you'll be able to hear the roar of the planes' afterburners when they kick in.So I guess it's enough on the hardware and the technical aspects of Soar into the Sun, so what about the storyline? It's perfunctory to say the least, with balance achieved in providing the myriad of characters their particular idiosyncrasies and one note role in the narrative. There's the token love interest for Tae-Hoon in Sergeant Se-Young (Shin Se-Kyung), the prettiest and most competent technical ground crew around, her boss and comic relief played by Oh Dal- Su, fellow co-pilot Yoo-Jin (Lee Ha-Na), and the rookie (Lee Jong-Suk) whom I do not know how he'd pass the pilot qualifying tests for his frequent fainting spells when subjected to high G-forces.Soar into the Sun, also known as R2B: Return to Base, is pure entertainment, where the story didn't really do much, with odd screwball comedy thrown around, it does provide one heck of an adrenaline ride. Rain fans will celebrate at an obligatory scene where their idol appears topless, but the real stars of the film, are the military hardware on display. And this scores from every angle you're seeing this film from. So I'd give it a biased definite recommendation!", "South Korea's answer to TOP GUN (1986) -- SOAR INTO THE SUN (a.k.a. R2B: RETURN TO BASE) is a big-budget blockbuster tries to replicate the Hollywood-style of filmmaking mostly found in any summer movie tentpole. It certainly has that showy and expensive look, particularly for its many impressive aerial stunts (more on that later). But writer-director Kim Dong-Won botches everything up with too many cheesy melodrama and mawkish sentimentality borderlined into self-parody. No wonder the movie ends up underperformed at the domestic box-office.In this embarrassingly lackluster movie, the story centers on Jang Tae-Hun (Rain), a cocky young pilot of the South Korean Air Force's elite Black Eagles squad who gets expelled of the team, following from his dangerous daredevil stunt at an air show. As a punishment, he is immediately transferred to the 21 Combat Unit, which is led by Park Dae-Seo (Kim Sung-Su). Meanwhile, it doesn't take long before he makes enemy with an ace pilot Lee Cheol-Hee (Yu Jun-Sang), who particularly hate each other. Naturally, they prepare to engage in a flight contest to see which among of them emerge as the best pilot in the 21 Combat Unit. Of course, such genre movie like that wouldn't be complete without an obligatory love interest. Enter Sgt. Yoo Se-Young (Shin Se-Kyung), a failed pilot-turned-head of maintenance who loves to act cool and doesn't particularly talks much, even though Tae-Hun likes her very much.Clocking at 113 minutes, I must admit that watching SOAR INTO THE SUN is seriously a test of patience. The first half is especially a huge letdown, in which the story drags too much that goes into nowhere. Most of the time we are forced to sit through a long-winded stretch of some lame romantic comedy (particularly the one involving Tae-Hun and Se-Young) found in Korean TV drama, and not to mention, many other annoying subplots. If Kim Dong-Won is trying hard to be funny, then he fails miserably. Even by the time the movie reaches the second half with a sudden change of dramatic tone, it's already too late and too little to redeem everything.Still, those are looking forward for some sensory thrills will be excited by the aforementioned aerial stunts. The two climactic highlights -- the aerial battle within the city of Seoul and the explosive finale -- are undeniably breathtaking with swooping cameraworks and magnificent sound effects that they are best seen in a big screen theaters.Too bad that's the only good thing about this movie. The rest is simply a monumental waste of time. If that's not insulting enough, the cast is a total disappointment who are all nothing more than one-note stereotypical characters. Rain, who completed this movie before heading off for his obligatory national service, gives an unremarkable performance who spends most of the time looking too cheesy or (ahem) cutesy. Sure, he does show some \"seriousness\" towards the second half, but by then, it's really hard to take him seriously. As for the rest of the supporting actors, the less said the better.So much for a so-called movie specially released in remembrance of the 60th anniversary of the Korean War.", "Weak storyline, like most aviation film much as to my disappoint this could have gotten a good 7 if the writers thought of a better script. There was too many silly lines that I wonder if this was suppose to be a manga filled humour or a live action film. The thing I found interesting though is the tensed relationship with the Americans and Koreans when dealing with missile crisis, couldn't the writers explore on that more than silly aspect of the film. Poor CGI, while it is understandable that there are parts of the film where real fighter jets cannot be used i.e. city dog fight scenes, I believe that they could have done a better job. The characters, I really don't think the Korean Air force would have allowed impulsive, childish and hot headed pilots into their ranks. And what is with them abusing the engineers. Come on its the military discipline, team work and proper conduct is a big thing there. Verdict: Disappointing, this film could have done better.", "The movie was terrible. I expected much more. The planes were all CGI and not believable. I hate the planes. The script was very poor. The acting was good, but the actors and actresses talents' were wasted by poor predictable script with superficial treatment about the soul of flying. I ran my player at 4X to 10X speed to skip the plastic human relationships. Characters don't make sense to me. Pilots were treated like stupid people. Same as mechanics. No dignity for pilots and mechanics. This movie didn't do justice to them. What I want is serious piloting and commanders showing tactical thought, excellent mechanical understanding of aircraft, excellent weapons systems mix between missiles and dogfights, with clear plausible combat scenarios.", "R2B is definitely a Korean attempt to combine a Korean style drama and a military style of TOP GUN. The CG is absolutely perfect, the VFX and sound FX are great as well.The first half of the movie contain mostly the Korean's dramatic scene found in most Korean movie. It could be funny, with a little-to-no excitement at all. The first half suffer greatly from too many antics from Tae-Hun, a fail attempt at love, straightforward plot which you know what will happen next, and \"Rain\" himself. You can't take him seriously by the time second half begin.Also, they copy the \"Tower fly-by\" scene from TOP-GUN.The second half contain some serious and intense action scene. The CG dogfighting in Seoul and the strike at Wonsan base is really amazing and look realistic. However it is lack of realistic detail and can be really annoying.Military expert can get really annoyed by the action scene, filled with unrealistic event. The dogfight scene break several laws of aerodynamic and thermodynamic. The missile locking system are strange too. In several events you can see the pilot shoot a ground target with air-to-air missile. Also, The director forgot that MiG-29A carry only 100 round of ammunition for the cannon. But the excitement of the battle mean that we can ignore that. The movie end with another f*cking romantic scene. Annoying already in the first half, you really can fall asleep at the end.", "This film didn't have the look and feel of a Korean film. It also felt like two completely different films: the first half being a slow-paced comedy; the second half a fast-paced action drama. The film felt like it didn't really know what it wanted to be, and even during the more serious moments, I didn't find the actors serious enough. Most of the time I had no idea what the film was actually about.The antagonists are not set up properly and only appears at the halfway mark, without any mention of them prior to this. The attack happens suddenly without explanation as to why they are attacking or who they really are. The attack scene was really good, but not enough to save the film. It felt like they blended together 'Top Gun' and 'Behind enemy lines' to ultimately become 'Sky Hunter'. Speaking of which, I'd rather watch 'Sky Hunter' a hundred times over before giving this film a second viewing.", "The movie presents us with another fighter pilot themed story, a theme that hasn't seen any good work on its regard since Top Gun. The plot served here is quite the average of competition among ace pilots mixed with their on-ground relationships. One thing that makes it's more interesting than others with the fact that this movie uses the inherent war potential between the two Koreas as its finale. But the execution can be deemed too pretentious in my opinion. It's because despite the age and technology is supportive, the plot doesn't seem to be real when it comes to all the technical things about the air combat. For instance, when Tae-hun's jet plunged into the sea after he put off the engine to evade the missile, the plane didn't pierce the water like it should. Rather it looked like it dropped from some five meters or so, bouncing it's way on the water surface. These 'uniqueness' supports the story's continuation about the characters surviving the crashes and so on. But it surely looked stupid for those for understand physics even at the least bit.

I saw this film when it premiered at the Busan International Film Festival and was impressed. It's one of the first Korean movies I've seen that actually made me laugh, and had some heart. Plus it has been a huge critical and commercial hit in Korea, so I'm surprised there aren't more Korean movie fans on here giving it positive reviews!For those looking to get into Korean cinema this movie offers a nice alternative from the dark films that Korea tends to be known for internationally. While I enjoy some of these darker films like Oldboy, Mother, and I Saw the Devil, it's refreshing to see a Korean film that doesn't leave you feeling sick or depressed after the curtain falls.This movie has the usual themes covered in coming of age stories, but also deals with other issues relevant to modern Korean society, such as the treatment of foreign laborers and the disabled by a Korean culture that isn't always welcoming to outsiders. All that said, the highlight of this movie is the relationship between Wan Deuki and his teacher. This is the source of a great deal of humor and warmth throughout the movie, and will make you laugh out loud more than other Korean movie I can think of.

Most of the Korean films which I have enjoyed have been dark/suspenseful/supernatural. This movie is not like any other Korean film that I have watched, but it is a lot like the Japanese classic \"Ping Pong\" and it is a lot like American coming of age films such as \"The Freshman\", \"Breaking Away\" and \"The Graduate\" and the Australian movies \"Muriel's Wedding\" and \"Strictly Ballroom\", i.e. there are plenty of belly laughs, a few tearful moments and a sense that what you are watching is universal.Anyone who watches this looking for another \"Shamo\" (I love Shamo, btw) or similar martial arts film will be disappointed. While it starts on a downer note, it ends on a spiritual/emotional/intellectual high. I can not praise it highly enough.

Exciting... do I make you excited?", "This movie goes in a pretty much generic direction when it comes to a Korean teacher trying to help out a student that feels all alone and gets into trouble. With some romance for both characters thrown in. Which is a shame cause from the trailer, I was expecting some unexpected and yet effective drama with some good amount of humor. The humor is just really bland in this movie and the story isn't anything special. The only thing that stands out is how there are actually these types of students living in Korea so it can be relatable. The building of the bond between the student and the teacher goes in a pretty much narrow direction. I was more interested in the romance between the teacher and the next door neighbor.

The actors and actresses here are very good, most especially Kwon Sang Woo, the lead male star. I also like Choi Ji-Woo she is actually one of Korea's finest star.

However, watching Korean TV series has changed my perspective forever.This is my second IMDb comment since I started using IMDb many years ago. I am compelled to write about this series because it deserves to be noted, along side with another Korean TV series \"Dae Jang Geum\" (AKA A Jewel In The Palace) if you have not already seen it.If you have been an avid Korean romance TV drama fan before watching this series, you will probably find this one too clich\u00e9d and has taken (politely speaking) the \"best ingredients\" of other romantic-themed TV dramas.However, if you are new to Korean romance TV dramas (dare I say anyone who has watched less than 5 Korean TV drama series prior to this?), then this will probably woo you as it did me, and forever change your view of Korean romantic TV dramas, for the same reason above: when you see other similar dramas after this, you will find bits and pieces of the others that remind you of this one. But -- most importantly -- this one has managed to weave it together better than all the others of the same genre to date. Is it any surprise that the writers and producers have benefited from previous similar productions? Would it be better off if this show was never produced?This brings me to the next point: I ask that anyone casting their vote to bear in mind that just because elements of this show came from others before it should not be the main reason for down-casting it. Should we down grade an ice skater's superior performance just because he/she has used similar steps as others before them? I think the difference is mainly in execution. This one is beautifully executed with some of the most memorable sound tracks for a romance-based TV series ever -- look up the song title \"Bo Go Ship Da\" on \"www.YouTube.com\" for a taste of what may have already become a classic -- seems that every Korean I meet knows this song. The only other Korean TV romance drama series that has this memorable a sound track would be \"Winter Sonata,\" but this show still manages to out-do it with it's own classic.I have heard many times from other people that watched this series BEFORE some of the other series telling me that \"nothing compares\" to this one -- that they are spoiled by this show. I concur. If you watch this series, it may just have the same effect on you. Luckily, even though I watched \"Dae Jang Geum\" after this, DJG was not similarly themed that I was not \"disappointed\" at DJG in any way.Does this mean this show is PERFECT? No -- hence the 9 out of 10. The acting by the stepmother and her daughter were over the top at times, and it did get a bit slower near the end where the emotions ran very high, but I strongly disagree with those that said the \"ending\" was bad because it is \"sad.\" I think the way it ended was beautifully done that though it was sad it wasn't poorly framed nor felt unpolished like some other dramas where the ending leaves you wondering if the writer fell asleep.So be forewarned -- watch this show and it just may change your expectation for other romantic TV series that follow forever, not to mention needing a box of tissue handy for each episode.If you want to learn more about the show (and therein possible spoilers), visit \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairway_to_Heaven_(TV_series)\" by cutting and pasting the address into your browser.Side comment: This series has been watched at least three times in our household. Each time my wife commented that Yuri would have been a better choice as the tragic heroine. Personally, I feel Yuri is prettier than Jeong-Seo. While this may just be a coincidence, did any one notice that Jeong-Seo and Song-joo have complimentary initials (JS vs. SJ)?? :)P.S. Please let me know if my comment is helpful to you so I know how to improve it for the future. Thanks!P.P.S.

The usual story for South Korean drama, after the couple separate and make up their relationship (they even get married), the girl was having terminal disease and died, end of the story. Perhaps the producer and the scriptwriter are crazy (absolutely they are). How can they make such a long story which was telling about how difficult the couple being together but at the end what they faithed is meaningless. Actually it's really a good drama , I like it but absolutely hate the ending so much.One more another disappointed drama from South Korea, and I wouldn't recommend this drama if you don't like sad ending because you'll be disappointed after you saw the ENDING.The soundtrack is good and I like it.", "Sorry to all Choi Ji-woo fans but I just don't see why you guys like her so much. The only thing she can do is cry. She can't do anything else.In \"Stairway to Heaven\" she plays the \"good girl\" (again for tenth time) who gets into a car accident (again). Kwon Sang-woo and Shin Hyun-joon did a good job though. Even Lee Hwi-hyang as the evil step-mother. This drama would've been better if the casting directors had picked a better actress.As for the young actors, I'd have to say that Park Ji-mi did the best job as Han Yuri. For a young girl, her acting was very good compared to Park Shin-hye (young Choi Ji-woo). To me, she's the best actress in the whole series and Kwon Sang-woo is the best actor in this.The storyline was also a clich\u00e9 used many times. Poor girl likes good guy. Poor girl's mom dies of cancer. Poor girl's father marries mean lady with mean step-sister and nice step-brother. Step-brother falls for poor girl. Mean step-sister falls for good guy. Poor girl gets amnesia.Haven't we seen enough of this. Can the producers come up with something better?! (2 out of 10)"], "1450": ["I normally dislike these ridiculous \"Hallyu\" (Korean Wave) dramas because of their over-the-top melodramatic nature, but I just finished viewing the final installment of \"Summer Scent\" starring Son Ye-jin in the female lead and I'd be lying if I said that I was not completely captured by the sight of Miss Son's impossibly lovely facade. One look at those soft, ideally feminine Asian facial features and one moment of listening to her alluring female voice was all it took to melt me. I'm glad that one of the local Korean-language cable TV channels here in my part of the Eastern United States decided to broadcast this series, for I may never have discovered her otherwise. The drama itself is probably average or somewhat above average -- it revolves around a love triangle involving Shim Hye-won (Miss Son), a young woman who received a heart transplant and who struggles to emerge out of a sickly childhood to live a normal life and experience the normal range of human experiences and emotions, such as true love. Someone get the tissue boxes ready, 'cause tears are gonna be a-flowin' on both sides of the screen.What may set this drama apart is the beautiful rustic South Korean scenery in which some key scenes are set and the wide range of stunning appearances that Son Ye-jin adopts throughout this drama. She's a pretty and energetic schoolgirl one minute, a sweet young maiden in conservative dress wandering in the woods the next, and a darling bride-to-be at yet another instance. The combination of breathtaking natural scenery and youthful smashing girl can indeed be a potent and poignant one from a cinematographic point of view. The musical score of the series is somewhat impressive, I must say, and merges harmoniously with the theme of the drama and the scenes in which the music is played. Even when the action in the series becomes dull, redundant, and excessively emotional, the mere chance to gaze at Miss Son washes away all other concerns about the drama. If you want to see what a comely and pleasant goddess from the Orient should look like, check out \"Summer Scent\" and fixate on the uber-attractive Son Ye-jin as Shim Hye-won for all 20 episodes.

After her recovery, her personality begins to change, and she develops a passion for life and an optimism that was denied her prior to the operation. She is involved with a young man, Jung-jae, who has been her sweetheart since high school, and things are looking good for her.A young man, Min-woo, loses the love of his life, Eun-hye, in a car accident on what appears to be his wedding day.

The two have a chance meeting on a nearby island when Hye-won, there to photograph wild flowers (she is a florist) is injured in a fall, and Min-woo hears her calls for help. Because she cannot walk properly, the two end up stranded there by approaching night and bad weather. They are forced to spend the night in a hut. They find they have a lot in common, a situation further exacerbated by the fact that Hye-won is strikingly similar to his dead girlfriend, from the words she uses when speaking, to her tastes and even the thoughts she expresses. Min-woo is both freaked out by and drawn to her. Hye-won in turn feels her heart beat painfully just by being near him.You can just about guess the rest. Of course, they fall in love. And of course, Hye-won's donor turns out to be Eun-hye. Therein lies the drama: neither party knows the history of the other, but it is discovered bit by bit, and exploited and used as leverage by Jung-jae, and also Jung-jae's sister, who has a wild and unreciprocated crush on Min-woo.Several themes are explored. And explored. And explored. To whit: Is the change in Hye-won's personality the result of her having a new lease on life after the transplant, or is it because she has taken on the traits of the donor? Does Min-woo love her for herself, or because she reminds him so much of someone he loved and lost? Does she, Hye-won, love him, or is it Eun-hye loving him through her, and she's just the body? Is her will her own, and does she even have a 'self' any more? And what of the long-time boyfriend who wants to marry her and will not give her up no matter what? And the sister who schemes to break them up? Stretched over twenty episodes, it becomes at times woefully repetitive. Supporting characters have little more to do than eat, connive and advance the plot. So why watch it? Two reasons: Son Ye-jin as Shim Hye-won, and Song Seung-heon as Yoo Min-woo. They are a match made in TV drama heaven. She is meltingly lovely and he is impossibly handsome. They bring a surprising depth to characters that could've been unbearable in lesser hands. Watching Song Seung-heon's eyes run the gamut from disbelief to fear to unbearable longing as he hears Hye-won speaking words he has heard before but coming from a different mouth, is a marvel of subtlety and beauty.

Many observers were curious as to the secret to its success. Was it because of the gangsters? the actors?The main reason for this movie's phenomenal success was the fact that is was a very good movie about male friendship. In Korean culture, friendship between guys is a very strong relationship. Especially in the city in which the movie is set - Pusan - loyalty and sacrifice for friendship is seen as a very important part of honour.In this movie, friendship is tested to the limit from beginning to end, as the movie's two main leads (Yoo Oh Sung and Jang Dong Gun) grow from being teenage rebels to big-time gangsters. The catch is, when they grow up, they become very different types of gangsters. One becomes a JOPOK - equivalent to the Korean Mafia, respected by the Korean people for sometimes punishing bad people. And the other becomes more of a thug gangster who kills and steals for fun.The direction is excellent, but the acting is the element which holds the film together as a whole. The two leads are two very different actors. The first, Yoo Oh-Sung, plays the Mafia gangster and has a very tough-as-nails look and uses method acting skills.

Chingoo is a touching first-person story about 4 boyhood friends and the way their lives unfold from carefree boyish cluelessness to the inevitable.There are flashy, chaotic,violent films like Pulp Fiction which become instant cult classics because they are not chaotic at all, but crafted immaculately. But the characters in Pulp Fiction are just that- unreal, comic-book lowlives who inadvertently display a few human characteristics while going about their destructive, pulp-fiction lives.Chingoo comes from the other direction, although it too is crafted superbly. No flash. Instead of the cool junkie Vincent portrayed by John Travolta, Joon-suk ably evokes a glimpse of the personal hellworld of addiction...and later wryly comments that he found the will to clean up after he saw he was losing ground in the gangster corporate hierarchy. Very much the CEO material. Yes, he coulda been a corporate contendah\u0085.and 500 years earlier he would have been the Korean equivalent of a Samurai daimyo\u0085if only..These are real human characters growing up in a society that is rigidly disciplined, yet dynamic- and their paths take them literally on an escalator of fate to adulthood with just a whimsical struggle of will by Joon-suk, the protagonist, the main toughguy. He evokes the late Lee Strasberg's famous line from The Godfather, \"These are the lives we've chosen,\" in the stolidity with which he accepts the horror of being a gangster. But he's a better man than the Godfather or the Pacino Godfather. He shows loyalty goes both ways.Thirty minutes after Pulp Fiction, you're hungry- in fact, there's no story to digest at all. It's a fairytale as it intends. Chingoo sticks to your ribs (spoiler pun) by building real characters and taking real themes and hinting at issues that torment great men. Unfortunately, the film is true to the clime, and there are no great women characters. I suppose that's true of the Godfather too. Gangsters just aren't chick-flick material.Chingoo delivers a supposedly autobiographical story by the director which tells me yet again that life is stranger, realer, better than pulp fiction.

What I can say is that this was a very stunning film, and with the time you spend thinking about it and the more times that you watch it it only becomes more relevant and better. Mr. Kwak is capable to tell the story of four friends on such an intimate level because it was based very much on his own personal experiences. The story is extremely genuine, and it holds so much water for anybody who has ever witnessed the people that they love ruin their lives. It certainly comes straight from the heart of Kwak, and while watching it it is hard not to become emotional as you see the film being developed.I also found the film to be made very professionally, with some great camera-work and never once did I feel that the production was sub-par. A lot of the camera work is well executed. Overall, the dialogue and story are very powerful, and the calm, reflective nature of the film makes it easy to watch. I enjoyed this film very much. Overall, one of the best portrayals of the passage of time, nostalgic sentimentality, and the relations of friends.", "A friend of mine who grew up in Korea recommended this movie to me a couple years ago.  He said it \"reminded him of friends he had when he was young.\" I thought about that and remembered my friends who I watched my first porno with and who fought by my side win or lose and who I parted ways with sometimes on not so good terms.  I ended up thanking him because the movie is a treasure trove of memories of coming of age.  It reminded me of elder brothers who showed me honor in martial arts and gangsta life and my close friends who went their separate ways.

Loved it all the way, hope to get the DVD as soon as possible.", "I found it sitting there at blockbuster and I grabbed it for the hell of it and was pleasantly surprised. This was one of the first Korean movies I saw and was completely blown away. Just about everything in this movie is done right. The story is extremely well told and interesting. Its a really intense/serious movie, but does not take itself TOO serious like so many movies and is quite often light hearted and comical. The acting really stands out in this movie, the performances are flawless. PLEASE see this movie. Rent it, buy it, borrow it. You will NOT be disappointed.", "This film is simply brilliant. Makes Scorsese's Goodfellas look like Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (no offence, Marty...but this is even better than the film you decided to remake). I was spellbound from the opening scene til the end credits. I love a \"span the generations\" gangster film. This one is truly on par with the Godfather part 2, if not (dare I say it) better? Director/writer Kyung-taek Kwak proves himself a major force in Korean cinema, and I'm sure has even ruffled the feathers of the great Chan-wook Park with this one (well, maybe not \"ruffled,\" as Park has since directed Mr. Vengeance, Oldboy, Lady Vengeance, and I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK, and Kwak has fallen to \"Typhoon.\") That all said, at least we know he has it in him, even if it was just a fluke. Certainly the best Asian film of 2001. 9 of 10 stars.", "Friend This is the course of friendship over a twenty year period. Beginning in 1975 we watch as four friends spend some time on what appears to be a summer vacation. Their future looks bright. A few years on as school and life takes its toll the dynamic between them changes and re-changes again as the have to deal with growing up, shattered dreams, decent into crime and drugs and the friendship itself. This is a dark little film that reminded me of some of the work of Martin Scorsese. Life often beats on these guys, from cruelty from their teachers to murder making it hard to get by. The course of these boys lives is not clear nor does it always turn out how we, or they think it will. The cast is excellent from top to bottom. Definitely worth seeking out, though be warned some of the violence has a tough edge to it.", "Because of his extraordinary handsomeness and popularity among female fans. Jang dong-gun  often played romantic parts in most of his previous works. Still his works showed clearly that he  made an effort in choosing parts with  different characters and played them with a wide range of styles, most notably in 'Medical brother','Love wind love song' and 'All about Eve'.But Dong-su in 'Chin goo'is a totally different genre of roles he used to play the result really shows what  a consummated actor Jang dong-gun is.The movie of course is good. It becomes the most money making film in Korean history and won many awards including Jang dong-gun's best supporting actor in Asian film festival. It is a gangster movie but focus more on the characters and their friendship. Dong-su ,a quite tragic and anti-hero character, with no elegance and glory, is opposite of what audience would expect if they are used to a regular Hong Kong style ganster film. With Jang dong-gun's performance, Dong-su's suppressed rage and sadness were effectively but delicately shown, though ruthless in mob confrontations, the audience would still feel sympathetic and mourn for his inevitable death. Besides Jang dong-gun, everything else is also excellent, the photography, the story, the directing styles, other actors, especailly Yu oh-seong (who also won the best actor award in Asian film festival) who play Jeong-suk.", "When director Kwak Kyung Taek works portions of this film as period pieces, the results are nothing short of spectacular beauty. Scenes depicting 1976 and 1981 alone are worth the price of this film.Sadly, the broader story of friendship gone awry is bogged down by clich\u00e9s and melodrama and stereotypical gangster character faux angst. The plot is incidental to the message that Kwak tries to convey with this film: pure and innocent youthful friendship can be undone by the broader, but ultimately less important, adult world concerns of lust, greed and power. Indeed, the plot has been so often done that there is no need to relate it in this review. Suffice it to say that two young friends become, as adults, underworld gangster rivals in Pusan, South Korea, with plenty of that old stand-by, bloodshed, thrown in.The beauty of \"Friend\" starts when two friends, Joon Suk and Dong Su, along with two other friends who don't become gangsters, try to examine sex as kids. In an amusing scene, the group confuses the word \"menstruation\" with \"vagina.\" This leads to some hilarity for viewers later as the sex-crazed kids go about typical early teenage shenanigans.Similarly, much later in the film, a precious scene unfolds when one of the non-gangsters visits the lair of one of his gangster friends and, while engaging in friendly banter, asks him why he, as a gangster, speaks of philosophy when he is but a \"hoodlum.\" The gangster's henchmen get itchy (a la \"The Godfather\") and the gangster, instead of killing or torturing his friend, humiliates his own henchmen for overreacting by placing them in compromising positions in a car trunk. \"How dare you suspect my friend and guest,\" he spits at his erstwhile protectors.Such portrayals of true friendship predominate until the last quarter of the film when the rivalry between the two former friends, the gangsters, erupts into stereotypical over-the-top violence reminiscent of DePalma and Pacino. And while these latter scenes are apparently meant to provide the purpose and meaning of \"Friend,\" they come off as clich\u00e9d shoot-em-ups, filled with ho-hum dialogue and predictably \"tense\" scenes that come up disappointing.Still, Kwak displays instances of brilliance, such as when he portrays the rebellious underworld of South Korea in 1981 under Chun Doo Hwan's military dictatorship. Women smoking cigarettes was taboo even when I visited the country more than a decade later. Kwak is able to depict subtle scenes of rebellion in a subtle manner, and these are the gems of the film that resonate: A stunning performance by a female rock band. A running away scene with Robert Palmer's \"Bad Case of Loving You\" blaring in the soundtrack. A \"West Side Story\" type brawl in a theater while a government propaganda newsreel runs in the background. Shades of \"Quadrophenia\" and \"Romper Stomper\" prevail throughout the early half of the film, and when they do, its scenes are effectively cut with enough humorous interludes that a viewer does not want the film to progress into the \"epic saga\" that it eventually tries, with limited success, to become.Former friends Joon Suk and Dong Su become reluctant adversaries and Kwak attempts to use this setting as a vehicle for a commentary on friendship. It works if your idea of friendship is apologizing to your best friend as he dies at your hand, or if confessing to that murder to face a certain death penalty qualifies as redemption. After a lot of violence and prison-cell soul-searching, the film concludes with a sentimental look back at the halcyon days of the friendly boys' respective childhoods. In this reviewer's opinion, it doesn't work. What does work is Kwak's initial representation of the boys' coming of age. If he had stayed there, this film could have been a lovely revelry in the ridiculous and absurd world of happily ignorant boyhood.Instead, Kwak tries for a home run when all the friends really need is a base hit.", "the story of this movie is very unique, and it is unbelievable for those people who live in North America. All these gang fights that we will never see in our countries are happening like everyday in Asia. i really suggest you to watch this beautiful movie, if you watch this movie and u think it is a bad movie, and then u have no taste for movies", "This move does not cross the east/west cultural barrier very well. I am not sure if non-asians can fully understand the confucian harshness and its effects on the Korean society. Nonetheless, like all great movies, this movie strikes at both the heart and the mind in unison.It intrigues our intellect with subtleties. It leaves us to wonder why the characters behave the way they do. Why must one friend murder an another? It isn't always clear. Why does one friend chooses an another friend as his favorite? No can be sure. Yet there are reasons.It moves our emotions because the movie is about the true meaning of friendship. It is loyalty above all else, even to the point of forgiving and understanding a friend who murders an another. Among friends, there is no hatred or bitterness, only forgiveness, understanding, and support.The acting is second to none. Both the lead and the supporting actors won the best acting awards at an international film festival. When the murderous and treacherous friend becomes himself murdered, it is a profoundly sad moment. Then we realize that we have come to love and care for the characters, despite their flaws, because we come to respect them as human beings capable of deep and profound friendship unlike any other.Finally, the director did an incredible job of enhancing the allure of the main female character. Her on stage lip lyncing performance as the lead singer of a high school band was shot beautifully. Understandably, all the characters fall in love with her at that moment, and so does the audience.", "Very real, wonderful, excellent. The film reflects the lives of four children who later each took different ways of living, ethics standards and habits. Why each of them was different later in his life? One cannot explain easily. Two of them became Mafia men, being one more  generous than the other, and the other two went to live modestly but clean at all. One of them became even a scientist. The end is tragic and difficult to explain, but life is as this, nothing goes with logic, many things have no explanation, and this is the case, why one Mafia loving the other Mafia as former classmate and buddy, ordered his subordinates to kill him? it is again difficult to explain, perhaps he loved him too much. This is not a slow film, but it goes differently if compared to American films.", "'Friend\" is a very Korean film about four best friend boys who grow up in Pusan (circa 1970ish) but take different paths through life. An artistically and technically good treatment of an old theme, this film  is a slow moving drama which buries itself in typically Asian melodramatic style in angst and woe over issues of loyalty, friendship, betrayal, honor, etc. \"Friend\" eventually becomes a bit of a mess spending too much time on long shots during which we're supposed to relish in the sentiment of the moment while dedicating too little time to explaining exactly what these gangster guys do beside talking tough and trying to look cool. One gets the impression being a gangster in South Korea is quite like any other occupation and there are probably ads for gangsters in the career ops section of the local newspaper. This film is made for and was a big hit with Korean audiences. It does not, however, make it well across the East/West divide. A subtitled watch for young adult males into Eastern films. (C+)", "If there were a movie out that resembled my story style, it would be this one. I guess to that credit, i gave it some unfair bias =)The elements of the story are like most of mine: Good setup and character development at beginning Wanes a bit in the middle Awesome End Underlying message trying to be conveyedThis is a beautifully told story and the fact that's its based upon the director's true life makes it better.My only complaint is the lack of development on the shrimpy character. THe movie starts out displaying the FOUR friendships and develops on that really well. Yet near the middle of the movie, the focus seems to be on the two gangsters and the narrator. It may be b/c that's how it was in reality, but the fourth character, I thought, needed to given more of the story, at least fictional roles just for balancing purposes.Other than a few carping details, I loved the film.The end owns and the quote from the beginning is quite relevant. The whole story displays LIFE and has reinforced what i believe life accounts - Memories. It is a series of memories and a series of moments that truly touches the heart and will perhaps make you realize memories of your own and how important and effective they are.8/10", "I highly recommend this movie, acting 10, camera man did his homework, story is so meaningful, beautiful movie! also there is Chingoo 2 but it's better to leave em there. Chingoo 2 ruined everything.", "FRIEND is nothing you haven't seen before. It's a South Korean Jopok movie, their version of the familiar American \"rise and fall\" gangster films. Having seen enough films from this part of the world, all I had to do was sit there with a checklist and checked off all the cliches that played out onscreen. FRIEND was a big hit at home, but it's certainly nothing special. The only thing that makes the movie stand out are the terrific performances by all involved, and the cinematography is just gorgeous. But for something original, go somewhere else. Then again, if you've never seen a Jopok movie before, FRIEND might seem really original to you.7 out of 10(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie and reviews of other foreign films)", "Friend opens with an idyllic scene in which several children are seen chasing a truck spraying water; I think it is water at least, on a hot summer day. With peaceful music playing in the background it feels as if the film is in the same nostalgic realm as Rob Reiner's Stand By Me. This feeling is given even more of a jolt when the viewer is introduced to four young protagonists: Sang-taek, Joon-suk, Dong-su, and Joong-ho. Although from vastly different backgrounds, Sang-taek is upper-middle-class; Dong-su's father is a mortician; Joon-suk's father is a gangster, etc., the boys form a strong friendship and spend their days swimming, asking each other outlandish questions, buying \"menstruation\" pictures, menstruation being the word used by adults for female genitalia, and watching porn.The friends are split up when they enter junior high school, but are reunited in high school. Enduring such individuals as their English teacher who not canes students on their bare feet when they cannot answer questions correctly but who also slaps and punches them, the boys feel the pangs of first love, Joong-ho for the keyboardist of the all girl band Rainbow and Dong-su and Sang-taek for Rainbow's lead singer Jin-sook. However, it is at this point a small breach forms in the relationship between Dong-su and Joon-suk. Joon-suk arranges for Sang-taek to go to a private room with Jin-sook while Dong-su is left out in the cold. After Dong-su asks Joon-suk if he is nothing more than a henchman, Joon-suk fails to give an answer.After a major fight in a movie theater which pitted the four friends against what seemed to be an entire school, the gang of four is split and Joon-suk and Dong-su entrench themselves deeper into the criminal underworld while Sang-taek and Joong-ho pursue their own goals. Sang-taek and Joong-ho meet Joon-suk a few years later, but the once hard-as-nails gang leader has been reduced to a drug-addled wreck. However, after yet another long duration of time, the friends meet again and Joon-suk is at the top of his game. Dong-su is also at the top of his game as well as the second in a rival gang.Threaded thickly with nostalgia, Friend will move anyone who reminisces about childhood friends. Although from completely different backgrounds, the friendship between Sang-taek and Joon-suk radiates deeply. Joon-suk's protective nature is almost frightening because of his almost dual personality of ruthless brute and a caring friend. While filled with violence and blood, in my humble opinion, the comedic interactions between the four men truly make Friend a good, if not outstanding, movie.", "This is quite possibly one of the most powerful movies I've seen. By far it's the best South Korean movie.It's a story about four companions who grow up together in South Korea. The four friends go throughout life always keeping in touch with each other, helping each other out, and always remain by each others side ;). Not only does the film contain some intense fight scenes, but it amazingly illustrates the bond that four kids can share with each other. Despite what other reviews may say, if you're interested in a good movie to watch with a best friend or girlfriend, I highly recommend this.", "One of my favorite movies. Normally I ain't into all the \"friendship\" theme movies, but this one has way much more and didn't approach the whole \"friendship\" issue that... touchy touchy.

Another also adopts to a life of crime though his manner is not quite as repugnant. Conflict ultimately engulfs these individuals, and this tests the depth of their friendship.While at times an engaging story, Friend literally oozes sentimentality in its long drawn-out finale. Focusing intensely on the male bonding that takes place between its leads, Kwak attempts to give us a portrait of men driven to acts of violence that, despite their repugnance, cannot sever the ties existing between them. Indeed, women in this film are relegated to the background, the attraction between the sexes also failing to dampen the emotional connection between its male characters. The story ultimately fails to convince. In spite of the praise heaped upon this film from other viewers, this is a story so dripping in emotional content, (it is laid on far too thick), the movie ultimately becomes an overly romantic take on male-bonding. One could also view Friends as an allegory on the North/South Korean divide. In spite of terrible violence in the past, the two Koreas share an inseparable bond, or so the allegory might suggest. But since the film doesn't quite deliver on its substance, an allegorical critique isn't really necessary.", "In a sense, Chingoo s probably one of the best Korean films because the concept is realistic, and although some of the circumstances and events in the movie seem to wild, the overall premise of the movie is still there. Four boys, of different backgrounds, grow up together. As they go through high school, it becomes apparent that each boy will take a different road entering man-hood. No matter what- each will stay will remain friends despite the drastic choices each of them make. (Hense the title \"Chingoo\" which means friend in Korean.) The only problem I had with the movie was the nagging question: What happened to the girls? The movie introduces several girls, and then they seem to disappear. This movie is great for anyone, it will keep you watching until the very end.", "My husband enjoys movies produced in Asia and the Orient. We watch a fair amount of those. The old \"seven samurai\" ranks as one of his favorites. I say that as an explanation that despite some familiarity with some foreign movies (not that we're experts by any means), and acceptance of some things as inexplicable cultural differences, I wanted to like this movie more than I did. It seemed well acted, the settings seemed authentic and interesting, the situations seemed real and sincere. But as my husband and I watched it there were a lot of times when we would look at each other in total confusion. \"Now what just happened? Can you 'splain that to me?\" I mean, I expect a certain amount of cultural differences, but often the character's reactions and motivations seemed completely baffling to us. We just shrugged and figured that if we knew the culture better we'd have understood.

Cha Mu-hyeok must be one of the most miserable roles in Korea drama. The chief actress is Su-jeong Lim. I have watched \"A Tale of two sisters\" before, her performance is perfect in that film, but I love \"Song Eun-chae\" more. She is so lovely in MISA. The fans in MISA are called \"MISA disabled person\". It means they lost their life instinct and just watch this drama without doing anything. \"I think I have become one of them.", "This drama was awesome because of many reasons. First of all the scenery was winter which made it perfect for the characters to dress fashionably. The characters were also really cool. I liked the way the characters were all very extreme, and that there were no boring characters. You either liked the character in the drama or you hated their guts. The music (noon ae kouth \"snow flower\") in this drama is awesome too.In addition, this series is not too long (16 episodes), so you could watch it in just one day. The drama is good from the start, but there was one part that I did not like, which was the episodes 11 and 12. But the ending of episode 12... !!! but the ending of episode 12 really gets you back into the series. Another thing that I did not like about the series was that in about 2 scenes the microphone can be seen.

The storyline is unique and the acting by the two main leads are nothing short of outstanding. It focuses on a mother's love for her child and how human beings are inevitably, soft-hearted creatures.This Drama originally planned to be screened only for 16 episodes, the netizens of Korea demanded an extension and KBS complied by asking the drama's directors and producers to extend by another 4 episodes. However, the makers of the drama refused and said they couldn't and quite frankly, I'm happy they did. In fact, the drama was so popular that KBS even issued a second OST album for it due to overwhelming response. Not to mention that the last two episodes were so sad, that even the makers of the drama couldn't help but cry when the scenes were played out I don't have the vocabulary to describe So Ji Sup's performance in 'Misa'. I had watched him in 'Memories of Bali' and always knew that he was good. But this time he really outdid all of us.So Ji Sup is just perfect for Cha Moo Hyuk With comparisons to her co-star, I loved Im Soo Jung from top to bottom. She was very much what her character required to portray: A simple-minded girl without her own dreams. In the beginning, Eun Chae desired whatever Choi Yoon desired, because Choi Yoon was the epitome of her life. But once she got to know Moo Hyuk, that changed forever. \"I'm Sorry I Love You\" has a deeper meaning throughout the normal K-dramas we see about love. It dwells more on the humanity of a person", "I'm Sorry, I Love You (2004) was a 16 episode, huge television hit series made by Koreans, but popular all throughout the Asian world.Slightly soap-opera-ish in nature, it is an extremely addictive show because it develops its plot lines slowly and you really begin to care about the characters. The leads are all very attractive people (especially the awesome and incredibly handsome Ji-seob So as Mu-hyeok and the little dynamo Su-jeong Im, who was great in the Korean hit film A Tale Of Two Sisters), and their acting is realistic and evocatively emotional, and often funny as well. The music is beautiful too and the production values are excellent. It was filmed in Australia and Korea.It's the story of a petty gangster, Mu-hyeok - a street hustler growing up homeless in Australia, who is shot in the head at the wedding of a woman he loved. She was marrying a rich gangster for his money, yet Mu-hyeok, still deeply in love with her, risks his own life to save hers when an assassin shows up to kill the wedding couple.The doctors cannot remove the bullet in Mu-hyeok's brain, and they give him only a few months to live. The woman he saved gives him a lot of money and tells him to return to his homeland of Korea to die. He goes and makes a search for his birth mother whom he believes gave him up for adoption because of financial hardship. When he finds her he is shocked to discover she is rich, has another son, and so he doesn't reveal to her his identity but instead plans his revenge on her.Along the way he discovers he has a twin sister, and he falls in love with a gentle girl named Eunchae Song who works for his step-brother. Over time he begins a mellowing process. Will he cling to bitterness until the end of his life, or will he find the grace to forgive those he believed wronged him? Many surprises are in store for the viewer during this series, right up to the last scenes. There is also some wonderful humor to relieve the dramatic tension. I really loved this show and everyone I have recommended it to has become as hooked as I was! It's just as addictive as those famous British - PBS series such as Upstairs, Downstairs or The Forsyte Saga or The Duchess of Duke Street! Except the stars are all Korean! Now, there are several ways to buy this awesome series. You can order each episode off Amazon On Demand for $1.99 each, but the files have DRM copyright protection on them so you'll only be able to watch them on your computer. These are good quality files with excellent white subtitles in English.Or you can buy a 9 disc box set from KBSDVD, which is out of print now but worth tracking down because it has the best images (though the subtitles are not as good as the Amazon video files).Then there is another KBS release that is only 2 discs, but the images have been condensed to MPEG1 files instead of proper MPEG2 files, so I suggest you avoid this one. The yellow subtitles in this box-set are terrible in comparison to your other options. Ask the seller how many discs are in the set you wish to buy.Yet another box-set with 7 DVDs is available in Korea, but you're not going to find that selling here in the States because it is Region 3.However you track it down, don't miss it. It's literally the most addictive show I've watched in years and years. I love it! 10 stars out of 10.", "A soulful performance by the lead actor So Ji Sub makes this series worth watching. This could have been your average Korean melodrama however, the sincere, soulful and heartfelt performance by So Ji Sub elevates this melodrama to the highest degree. \"Sorry, I Love You\" is a journey of a young man who transforms from a minor vengeful petty thief into a decent caring human being. So Ji Sub's transformation throughout the series is quite remarkable, he displays great sadness and longing for love and acceptance. Lim Su-jeong who plays the unlikely love interest also gives a tender and genuine performance. Overall, the series has a rather karmic and dark message about \"whatever comes around goes around\". Su-jeong's father ends up suffering the most for giving up the twin babies and keeping the secret from the lead character's mother. It's not your average K-Drama the message of the drama is at the very end of the series. Great story writing and great acting by So Ji Sub makes this series one of the best K-Dramas. It's definitely worth watching.", "Please notice the spoiler alert. You do not want to read this if you haven't seen this wonderful show.As I have noticed in other Korean dramas, this one, too, attempts to tackle a social problem that arises in societies where kinship and social status based on family background are important. Here, too, we have fractured families with adopted, abandoned, widowed, or orphaned members. The only intact family is the one of the female lead (Song Eun-Chae, portrayed by the excellent Im Soo Jung), whose father bears the burden of holding the information that would have made the male lead (Cha Moo-Hyuk, played by the incredibly handsome So Ji-seob) stop hating his biological mother, and whose mother is a bitter shrew; so this family is outwardly intact, but inwardly fragmented. The search for family acceptance and love is paramount. Moo-Hyuk is a lonely and homeless outcast who preys on hapless female Asian tourists in Australia; his only emotional anchor is another Korean who marries a rich Australian for his money. As explained in another review, Moo-Hyuk gets to see Korea to find his mother during his last few months of life. Through a series of rather implausible events, he does find his biological mother, but also finds out -- erroneously -- that she abandoned him and a twin sister at birth. Bent on revenge, he focuses on whom he presumes to be his half-brother, Yune. He insinuates himself into Yune's life, almost lets him drown, watches as Yune's stylist (Eun-Chae) gets beaten up, and seduces Yune's girlfriend, until Yune loses his cool, gets into a car wreck, and is found to have a defective heart. When both Yune and Moo-Hyuk find out that they love the same girl, Eun-Chae, a terribly destructive struggle ensues that is centered on another Korean social value and thus problem: loyalty. Eun-Chae has grown up with Yune, has always been seen like a little sister by him, and is tied to him through her parents who work for Yune's mother, her own job working for Yune, and her secret crush on him. It is not until Moo-Hyuk intervenes that she realizes that she has choices in her life beyond those dictated by family ties and life history. It takes her a good amount of time, but after much agonizing, she finally chooses to be with Moo-Hyuk. He, however, cannot really set Eun-Chae free because he chooses not to let her come too close to him so that he can protect her from the certain heartbreak she would have to endure upon his impending death. Besides seeing So Ji-seob's and Im Soo Jung's superb acting, I enjoyed watching the character development of Yune (a supremely spoiled pop star), his mother (an egocentric woman clutching success), his former girlfriend (a nympho-manic starlet) and Eun-Chae's father (an unfailingly loyal chauffeur). All of them \"grow up\" by realizing their short-comings -- and it is through the homeless petty criminal Moo-Hyuk whose heart (!) was larger than theirs. Since Eun-Chae could not consummate her love with Moo-Hyuk, she commits suicide one year after his death, thus fulfilling her prophecy that they were not meant to be together in this life. I, too, grew from watching this story. My husband of two decades is here, not fatally injured, and we have sort of neglected each other's company.

However, if that's your cup of tea, then this is right up your alley!Kiss scene rating***: 7/10. Dan-i and Eun-ho are really adorable together and do have chemistry, though it is more on the level of a teenage crush. They share a number of kiss scenes, but the kisses all lack intensity (I wish there would have been at least one really \"invested\" kiss).All in all, highly recommended for k-drama lovers!******It can be frustrating to get so emotionally invested in a romance, only to be let down by a less-than-satisfying kiss (whether it's a lack of chemistry, depth or quantity). So I give kiss scenes a separate rating.", "So I've heard about K-dramas for years, but only started trying them (and J-shows) recently because of their availability on streaming services. I loved Train to Busan and mostly enjoyed the Along with The Gods movies.I got into the last TV series I binged, but as I neared the last third, I found myself fast forwarding and wishing it would just stop - it was SO melodramatic. I'd come so far, though, that I just wanted to see the end. Romance is a Bonus Book isn't melodramatic - it's funny, sweet and evenly-paced. I'm enjoying it unfold as it is and I haven't gotten antsy.I genuinely laugh out loud and simultaneously love/hate that the two leads aren't together. I want them together, but drawing it out just makes it all the more enjoyable.I won't ask for more than this in a show, no matter the nationality. It's the new reality of on-demand, and it works.", "I find myself totally immersed in this love story. I have never been a fan of movies/shows where I had to read subtitles- but it popped up on my Netflix feed and I ended up binge watching the first 8 episodes. I can't wait until the next one. Loving the love.", "I'm in love!!Couldn't stop watching, and fell totally in love with the characters, storyline, and all scenes.", "Romance is a bonus book is a heart-warming rare drama full of suspense and meaningful quotes interweaved throughout. This was so beautifully written and perfectly unfolded just like a perfect book. The storytelling had an artistic aspect and flowed almost fluidly. The cast were exceptional in portraying the passion the characters had towards books. An enjoyable drama complemented with amazing performances", "It started off quite well but towards the end, for me it tailed off, maybe because it wasn't quite dramatic enough for me and I have watched loads of kdramas, romance, thrillers, action and historical but I found this one a bit insipid. Nice characters and interesting to see how a publishing company operates. Personally, I found the male and female leads didn't gel at all, no chemistry there, it was like watching brother and sister!", "Romance is a bonus book uses books to paint the story of a woman who didn't give up and tries still to survive. The drama at first, was really sweet and \"cozy\", as we watched the leading lady strugle to get by after her life has turned upside down after her divorce. The friendship dynamics were top notch and the subtle romance was just enough to ignite one's imagination. Also, the office story was really good as well. So, if you like books, you'll probably love the first part. However, halfway through, it was clear that the drama didn't have anything else to say. You'll just watch the characters live their lives with nothing interesting happening to them. The small twists were blunt and the romance lacked intensity. Also, I really hated the fact that the leading lady was always thinking of her daughter at first, but she just forgot about her after a while and it was like she never existed. I mean, what happened to her? Why wasn't she part of the story anymore?\nOn a more positive note, the performances were good and the bookish refrences nicely done. The side characters' stories were interesting as well. So, 6 out of 10, because I loved the first part, but the second one was boring.", "Very light and yet the storyline is amazing. you will be hook onto your seat. who doesnt like happy endings. great series", "Live your life to the fullest no matter what...\nEach & every scene of the series makes you fall in love with it. It's not just about romance but a lesson for life that whatever the situation comes in your life you should always face it with a pinch of smile.\nEach & every characters are lovable whether it's the Soft hearted President Kim or the stubborn Ms. Go every character has later which leaves an impact. But the character played by Ms. Song Har rin is just wow every times she appears on screen you are in for a wonderful moment on screen. She is just legit though not being the main lead.\nThis is book which every one should read whether you are romantic or not.\nBeautiful...", "Loved it! This is a sweet and silly, but sometimes serious, show that captures your heart and make you happy! It's about hard work paying off, friendship and very chaste love. If you look at the world through pastel couloured eyeglasses, perhaps this is what it looks like. The acting is flamboyant, the story like a fairy tale, and the people always beautiful.", "I didn't expect that the noona and Jeongsuk will have a good chemistry. They really gave the the romance for the story. It was also nice that tgey expose the works of a book publishing company. I learned a lot. The second leads were not disappointing either. I just wish the two youngster character is not that overacting.", "A captivating story of family, hardship, life, friendship and overall love and honesty.\nI cannot yet believe how much I have enjoyed this serie. I was captivated by the storyline from the first episode all the way to the end.I have learnt to love every character and must say is hard to say goodbye to them.I travelled alongside with them and fell in love with the language so much I forgot I had to read subtitles.I definitely recommend watching this show, you will end loving the story and thinking of working in a publishing company...maybe move to Korea?", "Jong-Suk Lee is such a sweet and charming actor and I loved his acting in some of this past TVshow. He was the reason I watched all episodes. However, this K-drama is just nice. Full stop. Don't expect anything special just a good feel time. Sometimes a bit too cheesy. It doesn't really deliver an interesting story. I fast forwarded quite a bit. There is absolutely no chemistry between this handsome man and the femal lead role which I found unconvincing. Its like a play between brother and sister. I hope to see Jong-Suk Lee soon in a more interesting story!"], "1461": ["This series is one of the best i've seen yet. It keeps you guessing and wanting more. I will admit the ending could have explained things further but none-the-less its great.You have Bok-Su go An ex-pickpocket who meets up With Gyeong Jeon. a keyboardist for a band.When Bok-Su steals the money to help out Gyeongs friend, Gyeongs begins to go after him to get the money, yet Bok-su finds out the reason for all the money. Soon Love seems to blossom between them, yet, each one has an obsessive G/f and B/f.Its a fantastic series, i didn't want to spoil the greatness of it."], "1462": [], "1463": [], "1464": [], "1465": ["I saw this movie a while ago in Asia and it also had an alternative title \"Teacher vs Student\". Usually I hate the way Korean girls act; though Korean actresses are some of the most beautiful women in the world, the characters they portray tend to whine and cry a lot and act totally irrational.But the girls in this movie are smart and funny and the way they fight is freaking hysterical considering the age difference.The only thing I didn't like about this movie is that it felt a little too long. Parts of the movie felt like it was getting too serious for a comedy, but luckily it picks up again and the ending is very satisfying!", "\"Women can't make friends each other\"- whether this statement is true or not, it is partly proved by this hilarious movie. Director Jang was critically acclaimed by his previous school teacher comedy- Teacher Mr.Bong-du Kim-, but his piquant message now became dull when it comes to the rivalry between a female teacher and a student.What leaves much desired in this movie is that the interactions among characters are so deterministic and so unidimensional as not to be assimilated with the participants of normal everyday school life. The female teacher is unbalanced and crippled with her soleness over the age while the student suffers from the alienation from the local community. Their common resolution is their own one-sided affection toward a young and handsome bachelor teacher. How far this nonsense can make a duel between an aged adult teacher and a sentimental young female student? The plot is reiterating that of Mr. Bong-du Kim, and the result is almost the same- Teacher and student can be tied with heart. I don't understand why a simple result cannot but be from the unrealistic setting like this?"]}
