TAJJA has style to burn, and from the very start, there's flashbacks, split screens, hyperbolic action, and the expected doses of melodrama in the story of a young gambler's rise to fame. Most intriguing of all is the Korean card game that frames the action   a game that attracts die hard gamblers and a small group of cheats who live off the system. As such, this often feels like THE STING, but with a more brutal core. The narrative is set out in a series of lessons any prospective gambler must learn; with each lesson, the risks become increasingly challenging. The narrative almost manages to support a love story, though there's no room in a gambler's heart for true love. The energy of the narrative is matched by the plot's daunting complexity, but the film journeys into surprising areas. It's safe to say that TAJJA will inspire many more gambling features, though it would be hard to surpass the originality and style of this film.", "The War of Flowers, arguably one of the best Korean motion pictures based on cartoons, is a film about gamblers. The film boldly anatomises and exposes the underworld of gamblers which seems to epitomise our greedy capitalist society. And it is well timed, given a corruption scandal involving pachinko parlours that has given a big blow to Korea's already beleaguered ruling party.As a movie partly comic and partly brutal which deals with working class characters living on the dark side, it outdoes Guy Ritchie's 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. The actors, main and supporting alike, are superb. In particular, Stunning Kim Hye Soo exquisitely plays a Dashiell Hammettish femme fatale who contrives and organises fraud gamble matches as well as lures easy preys.Director cum scripter Choi Dong Hun weaves together all these characters and their stories in a seemingly effortless manner, showing his brilliance.", "Movies about gambling are very rare in Korea,and none have been a smash hit. I myself didn't expect to be impressed with the film Tajja,which is based on the hit comic with the same name. Coming out of the theater, I thought it was the best movie I have ever seen. The story revolves around KimGonni(Cho Seung Woo),who loses all his money to a tajja while playing the traditional Korean gambling game 'Hwatoo'. For a while he just visits illegal gambling centers,hoping to catch the tajja who took all his money. Coincidentally he happens to cross the most skilled tajja in the country,PyoungGyoungJang(Baek Yoon Sik).Becoming Pyoung's apprentice,Gonni learns the skills and tricks,becoming a master tajja himself and earning loads of money.While he promised PyoungGyoungJang that he will retire once he earned five times the money he lost,he just can't seem to stop playing hwatoo.But the world of gambling is not pleasant as it looks........ I don't want to be critical,but all the comic based Korean movies that I have seen sucked, including the horror film 'Apartment'and 'Dasaeposonyu'. 'Tajja'was different. It carried on the story so swiftly and interesting that the running time of about minutes just passed swiftly like the wind. I was especially impressed with Yoo Hae Jin,who plays Gonni's friend tajja Ko Gwang Ryol, and, like all the people who've seen this movie,Kim Hae Soo, who plays Madame Jung,a woman who organizes planned gambling games with tajjas. I hope there will be a sequel,because 'Tajja'totally changed my view of Korean movies.", "A scrambled time line leads to an initial sense of an impressionistic, messy plot that the viewer will have to try to put back together at the end. An overarching story does develop eventually even though the particulars pile up like a plate of noodles.Go Ni is a young man who gets involved in gambling, first as a perpetual loser, then as an apprentice to a master gambler, and finally as an accomplished high roller that is heavily compromised with its violent milieu. The game is no limit hwatu, a sort of Korean poker, played with thumb sized cards, any of which easily hidden in the palm of your hand. And there lies the rub, for the small size of the cards allows conjuring professional gamblers to win consistently over innocent suckers.As Go Ni rises through the ranks, he eventually reaches the rarefied heights of the high rollers, where more money is bet than you can shake a stick at. It is also an environment of strongmen and women with its own violent rules.There is a fair amount of hwatu gambling and it would help to know some about the game, in particular the ability to recognize card faces. It would help but it is not strictly necessary.This is the kind of film whose central premise is that violence is entertaining. The more perverse the better. There is plenty of it, though the gore is contained. It is not the aseptic, blazing guns style of violence so dear to the American psyche, but the intimate violence of the sharp blade more to the liking of orientals. The high rollers culture of illegal gambling filled with trickery and treachery but also with a retributive code of honor is a perfect breeding ground for that kind of violence. Mounds of money on the table are insufficient to pump adrenaline into the veins of underworld figures with plenty of blood in their hands. Limbs    in the form of fingers, ears and hands    are bet. It's no longer a question of winning but one of not losing, of humiliating and debasing your opponent psychologically but, more perversely, physically.If gambling and blood fests are your cup of tea, then you should be satiated, otherwise you have been warned. If you do see this, pay attention to the four rules of the master. They can be useful for life in general.

I really enjoy this drama very much. The drama has flaws of course but it is very entertaining at least to me. A mercenary soldier was framed for the murder of civilians or his own girlfriend and he was on the run. Later he would be joining to the bodyguards team of one of the president candidate family then he would be called Kim Jeha or the code name K. There he got a job to watch over the candidate secret daughter who could ruin the candidate career if she is made known to the public as his daughter.Go Anna was a secret daughter of the president canditate with a famous actress who died and not with his legal wife Choi Yoo Jin who is one of the main villain of our story. One thing is that she really is ambitious to make her family stronger by making her husband a president. She also kept Go Anna as her victim by not letting her see the father and very manipulating with the girl's mind. She could kill anyone who she think will come into her way. Many people are drawn by this character. The actress playing role is really great. Choi Yoo Jin has reasons for her to become evil. She has soft spot for Kim Jeha since he saved her life though she ordered him get killed at first. Jeha joined her side only they had one enemy or the competent another candidate who got Jeha framed for murder. Jeha was a compassionate upright guy who pity the weak or someone who does not have much power. He pity Go Anna for being the victim of her stepmother and her own father. She was all alone like him to which lead him to fall in love with her i think. They both have childlike behavior too as seen in episode  when he was looking at her eating ramen and dance happily from CCTV. Jeha is very protective of her and she depends on him quite a lot. She dislike her stepmother for keeping her like this and think she also killed her own mother. In the middle of drama the Choi Yoo Jin's half brother try to make her want to revenge against his sister since he hates his sister and want to be more powerful. Anna give in to him for a time. But at the end of day the it was not the revenge she actually want. She is just finding herself and her past. She really depend on Jeha and care for him most since he is most concern with her being. Although he is fierce fighter, jeha is so smitten with her. They were just breath of fresh air in this dark drama. One more thing i do not think Anna was a weak character but a strong one because we see she try to run away from her own situation to find her father who she long for; who she think loves her and she loves. But she got the warmness she long for from Jeha instead. She might be stupid at a time but i think she is very brave in her situation. As for Choi Yoo Jin, her power come from her family. She is destined to be evil. Her father was a ruthless man just like how she became. She was competing with her relatives who hates her. She got a good_for_nothing husband who cheats on her. So yep she become a selfish villain. Yet she was very fond of Jeha; not in a romantic way. She was fond of him for his humanity and bravery and being a super hero. But it was too late for her to become good. I was so into these three characters. The political plots were good too. The only problem is that we do not learn Kim Jeha's background very much which i pretty much want to know.for examples like who his parents were and who is he really. I took one point off for this. But the ending was very satisfying still.", "This drama is said to be as good as the Healer (another action spy drama), filled with action scenes, martial arts conflicts, political twists and some romance. The story starts really well, with a solid mystery and wonderful sequences of Barcelona and other Gothic background. The film makers were generous with the amount of blood and fighting they packed the first episodes. The action continues till the very end, which was really strong, leaving an impact, as it didn't conform with the clich\u00e9 happy ever after. Another thing that I liked about this drama was that it portrayed each character in depth and presented everyone's motives and background, even emotions. In addition the performances were excellent, even from the second lead lady that, I admit, I didn't expect her to be that good. However, for me, the romance was a little weak, stuck between the twists and the action scenes, being only there to give motivation to the characters to act and go beyond the human limits. So,  out of .", "Firstly, my introduction kind long please patient with me. After watching about  episode. i felt wish to write a review this Korean TV hit drama . This drama kind like combine The bodyguard from Beijing(movie) + Snow white and  dwarf . Adding, this drama can say an alternate version Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton Politic life. Something like that. For the beginner part kind confuse to those elderly people but those youngster catch up fast. Yes i get it. Even my parent watch don't have any clue what they are watching. Those people got read review and some don't. My father guess correct about some part about this drama. Why i called alternate version Snow White and  dwarfs ? This drama got same stepmother with powerful witchcraft as for the drama got stepmother got powerful security company help supporting running for her husband president election. Adding dwarfs are represent the bodyguards. Kind like make sense. This Korean drama got best actress but she is a member group called Girl Generation. She really an angel. In the end worth watching and continue of adrenaline rush and heart pumping and romance.", "This series seem to be totally unrealistic and out of scenario. The idea is not so bad, but the slogan of the American s series where the bad guys are really bad, and the good guys are really good doesn't bring me any value.It seems in the Korean lifestyle the corporations have the vision of God like creatures able to invest, create and use unlimited amount of money, resources, people and etc.If you like films where the main character is being brought back from the void and  mins later kicks asses   then you may actually enjoy this crap. However it is not something I'm particularly thrilled about.I don't want to talk to much, but if I would have done this   it would have been is similar spirit... I'm sure you'll get the point! ;)", "This show is so annoying I registered an account just to tell you how bad it is. **spoilers throughout** Without a doubt, the worst thing that occurs in this entire show is the dancing with joy for having found a pack of ramen noodles in slow mo scene, which lasts at least   minutes and has romantic background music while the male lead stares at her like he's falling in love. What else is wrong with this scene? Well, the girl is so emaciated it is hardly believable that if she ever eats ramen that she keeps it down. Her clothes don't stop you from seeing her bare bones poking out now and then throughout the series. The acting is so bad, especially while dancing with ramen that you feel like fingernails are scraping out the inside of your brain, it's that painful. Thankfully, streaming allows you to skip a lot by jumping ahead. Oh, right, another thing I had to skip a lot: the fight porn in the first several episodes. Antagonizingly long fight scenes that reminded me of 's movies. Ugh. True bad ass fighters don't take that long to take out a bunch of guys, so it just doesn't work. Oh, and let's not forget the  naked guys in a communal shower fight scene, which also lasted a long time. Skip. Skip. Skip. I know right? And I actually like guys. Didn't anyone ask what is the point of this scene being so long? Shaky cam throughout. Even when totally inappropriate. Yeah, film makers snobbily call it found footage like that makes it more classy, but it's still annoying as hell when not used properly. There were a couple of times it was giving me a headache and I had to look away or skip ahead. Contrived. That style of camera work is best when it fits the action or adds something to the scene. Genre switching like nobody's business. Usually this is a political action thriller type of show, but once in a while they forced the actors to act like they were in a romantic comedy and then there would be cheesy romantic comedy music that didn't fit in AT ALL   and so makes you want to vomit. The characters in those moments had to act so inconsistent to their character from the rest of the show that I felt bad for them. The romance wasn't believable either at all. I don't think that girl is very good, specifically. Except when she's yelling and screaming at people. She seems good at that. The cutesy romantic parts felt like a plot device that the director didn't have the slightest idea how to deal with. Okay, so there's this Snow White theme going on with an evil stepmother mastermind and a magic mirror, which is a little sci fi fantasy, so felt like it was bending the genre a bit as well. However, the evil stepmother character was really well played and pretty interesting. She was so good it made me wish they had just eliminated the female love interest, who was terrible, and just let the evil stepmother carry it. The only reason I'm giving this a  and not a zero is because the stepmother subplot was so entertaining and believable. Unfortunately, most of the side characters were really well acted and believable, but the female love interest was bad enough, shallow enough, superficial enough to ruin the show, and the male lead appears to have been forced to do some shitty scenes on that account. His acting is great when that stupid girl isn't around. :P   Also, you have to suck at making TV shows to make that guy look stupid. Because he is super cute. After the first several episodes they seem to have some of their bad directorial choices put in check as the fight porn gets minimized somewhat or is better incorporated with the story later. There's still some painfully superficial romantic scenes throughout that are not believable. Like   oh, right, when the female love interest is dying from allergic shock and it's this big tense moment of trying to save her and   oh   the guy has to give her some mouth to mouth because she stops breathing   what do you think is most appropriate? None other than trashy romance music exploding out of nowhere, because a girl dying is soooooo sexy. That was probably the most insulting thing I had to watch as a viewer. Really? Someone thinks it's trashy romance sexy when someone is unconscious and dying. F.U.

When it got to about  minutes of thinking I realized that this was a hopeless effort.Honestly, if you can't give this film a  out of , what other movie deserves one? This film is the perfect mix of comedy, drama, romance, some of the best storytelling I've ever seen, and even some surprise action scenes! And what's best, it's universal. I'm sure some would avoid this film simply because it's Korean   but that's where you'd make a mistake.This film makes sense to anyone who's a teenager or has been one (recently.) Both college students, the clumsy, laid back Gyeon woo and The Girl, a whimsical tomcat, make for one interesting couple for the main characters. And everything that they encounter throughout the film magically comes together in the end, and it's truly heartwarming. You'll laugh, you'll cry, no matter who you are. I guarantee it. It couldn't be any better!", "*SPOILERS AHEAD*...taken from a reaction paper I wrote for Social Science Class..My Sassy Girl is a  film by Korean director Kwak Jae Yong, formerly known for the straight melodramas he directed. It was based on the novel with the same title, compiled from the journals posted on the Internet by Kim Ho Seok about his relationship with a girl. The film catapulted its lead actress Jeon Ji Hyun and its lead actor Cha Tae Hyun into superstardom. It spawned viewers' interest in romantic comedies, although it was never recognized in the west.My Sassy Girl starts out with Gyeon Woo, a na\u00efve but eccentric  year old college student who doesn't have a clear direction in life. He narrates how his parents raised him like a girl, and how his parents' constantly telling him he was smart caused him to become lazy. His life then becomes intertwined with that of a bizarre girl whom he meets at the subway. She was drunk and wasted when he first saw her, and before passing out at the subway she calls him 'honey'. He was then forced to take responsibility for her, and that night he carried the wasted girl on her back all the way to a nearby motel. Hilarity ensues in the following scenes, as Gyeon Woo and the girl share funny moments together, such as hitting each other on the subway, playing squash (the ball always hitting Gyeon Woo squarely in the face), dancing in the disco with their high school uniforms on, and exchanging shoes (the girl wears sneakers while Gyeon Woo wears heels).The early parts of the film showcase the girl's bizarre attitude. The girl can be seen arguing with strangers, writing synopses of action movies, passing out after drinking three glasses of beer, and hitting Gyeon Woo all the time, telling him 'wanna die?' and using him to get her way. Gyeon Woo, on the other hand, succumbs to all the girl's whims and does everything for her. The first half of the film is filled with pure physical comedy and witty, hilarious sequences.What sets this movie apart from others is how the second half of the film, which consists of pure melodrama, is connected to the first half. The second half explains the girl's bizarre attitude and unfolds all the drama behind the girl's comedic behavior in the first half. Gyeon Woo battles a conflict with himself and finds it hard to let the girl go after 'healing her sorrow'. The latter scenes in the film are so dramatic that it 'turns grown men into crybabies' (quoted from the International Movie Database). Jeon Ji Hyun's acting versatility added to the second half's strong impact on the viewers. A very ingeniously written script turns the laughing audience into a crying one in a short span of time.However sad the second half of the film may be, the 'overtime' part of the film wonderfully concludes all the comedy and drama that unfolded in the preceding two parts. Gyeon woo and the girl go along with the sad fate that befell them, continuing their own lives. The ending (which I will not reveal, for I recommend that people watch it) could be considered as one of the greatest ones in the history of film making. It left no questions unanswered, and it concluded all the subtle hints that the earlier parts gave. It left me, and other members of the audience, laughing in tears.The uncut version of the film lasts  minutes ( hours and  minutes), quite long for a romantic comedy. But it was so craftily and carefully written that one would not notice time ticking by. Every scene in the film gives the viewers something to laugh, cry, or think about. There was no dead air in the story. The cinematography of the film was excellent, for it captured every scene perfectly, also showcasing the beautiful environment of Korea along the way. The soundtrack very much added to the emotion of the film's most significant sequences. George Winston's rendition of 'Pachelbel's Canon in D' invokes a very romantic and joyous feeling that is indeed felt in the scene where Gyeon Woo gives the girl a rose during her class (at an all girls school) while she was playing the piano. Shin Seung Hoon's 'I Believe', the movie's main theme, served its function well as the tear inducer in the most dramatic parts of the film. After watching the movie, only hearing the song brings me to the edge of tears as I remember the saddest parts of the film.Jeon Ji Hyun's acting in the film was very superior. She does very well in portraying the unnamed girl (yes, the girl's name was never mentioned) in the movie. Her very strong charm and acting versatility (she laughs, threatens Gyeon Woo, and cries in one scene) makes the film very appealing, even to grown men who grew up watching action movies. Her performance in this film shoved her into the limelight and made girls want to be like her and made boys want to be with her.Cha Tae Hyun did justice to the role of Gyeon Woo. Just looking at him makes you laugh, and his being punched, slapped and manipulated by the girl is one of the big factors in the film's success as a comedy. His performance in the film made him one of Korea's 'most wanted dates', according to a survey on Korean girls.Some of the very notable characteristics that I found in the film were: .) It had no kissing scenes; .) The girl's name was never mentioned, although she played the biggest part in the film, and .) There were no 'I love you' lines in the entirety of the film.After watching the uncut version of the film, I saw tears in the eyes of most people in the audience. I could most probably say the movie has been successful in moving its viewers.Jeon Ji Hyun won the  Grand Bell Best Actress Award for her performance in this film. Cha Tae Hyun won Best New Actor at the  Korean Oscars for his performance in this film. My Sassy Girl was number one at the box office for six straight weeks in Korea and sold over , tickets per day in Hong Kong at the time of its release in . It was the second highest grosser of that year (accumulating more box office loot than SHREK, HARRY POTTER or LORD OF THE RINGS). It was the Best Asian Film at the nd Annual Hong Kong Film Awards. Just this year, Dreamworks (an American film company) has been planning for a Hollywood remake of this film. How great could this film get? My Sassy Girl is a film close to my heart. It is not only a lighthearted comedy that delves into the culture and behavior of Asian teenagers. This movie shows that there are so many different ways of expressing your love without saying 'I love you'. It is a movie that proves 'fate is building a bridge of chance for the one you love'.", "This is my \u0084afterword \u0096 maybe it's written more for myself, but please don't mind it and my lack in English too.When watching movies we rarely know what to wait from them and the least we wait the film to affect us so hard that suddenly a completely new dimension appears to us, that the movie will make us to look on things and life from a different viewpoint, will make you to remember forgotten things. But movies like that exist, and this is one of them .Thinking about this film I start to consider what the movie makers really want to achieve creating films and what is the task for a movie. Is it a picture movie with good cameraman's work, good acting , story or impressive special effects? These things are important ,but in my opinion, in a good movie the main is the message of it. I don't know if it is the director, the scriptwriter or the crew together who made this movie to touch the viewer, made him to look with a different look, who worked to make this film to deliver the message as it is, but I can say that they have achieved their aim.This movie is humane. It's message and characters are humane. It has no meaning if the end of the movie is happy or sad   there is joy and pain both in it, because that's exactly how the life is.I liked this movie. But it is impossible for me to rate it the same it's not possible for me to rate my own life.This movie touched me. I hope that many others too.", " Minor Spoilers This film is one of the greatest Romance Comedy movies ever made, and as such, I feel I will have a hard time doing it justice with a few lines written here. The story was first seen online as an internet diary written by Korean student Ho Sik Kim. And is claimed to be based on a relationship with a girl he actually met. Yeah, that's right. It's a (mostly) true story! Then the story was bought by Korean film production company, Shin Cine. Finally, Korean director, Kwak Jae Yong, 'Sketch of a rainy day' was brought on board to direct. The rest, as they say. is history.The entire movie revolves around two main characters, 'Kyun Woo' (Cha Tae Hyun) and 'The Girl' (Yes, her name is never actually given) played by the wonderful Jeon Ji Hyun. The story begins when Kyun Woo meets the girl on a train platform late at night. See, she's drunk. Very drunk. After making a fool of herself on the train she passes out, but not before calling Kyun Woo Honey. This leads the other passengers to believe that she is his girlfriend. In turn, our wimpy hero feels obliged to take care of her. So off he goes. Well, at least half way down the platform, before dropping her onto an empty bench. But do you think he has the heart to leave her there? Of course not. That's one of the things that makes this film special. Kyun Woo may be a bit soft. He may be even just a tad pathetic, but his heart is in the right place. All he wants to do is help the girl. But... What does he get in return? Well, He gets a down right scary, weird, psychopath of a girlfriend who takes every opportunity to either A: Hit him B: Humiliate him or C: Get him thrown into Jail. Yes, she's pretty mean. Or is she? Is there more to her than both Kyun Woo, and we the audience, can see? Maybe his wish to help her is not totally unjustified.One of the greatest achievements of this movie is in it's two leads. Considering nearly the entire movie focuses on just two people. The stars did a very good job of keeping up 'very' good chemistry. These are two wonderful actors who portray all the emotions needed, and at a very high level. Cha Tae Hyun, in his first role manages to keep Kyun Woo on just the right side of Bumbling, Shy and even Pathetic. At no point in the movie does he annoy, and that's a hard task indeed. He's always laughable. Granted, sometimes you laugh with him, mostly we laugh 'At him,' but that never stops you from thinking you'd like to have him as your friend. Jeon Ji Hyun however, is just incredible. She is the best actress of her generation. I don't just mean in Korea. I mean PERIOD. She fills the character of 'the girl' with depth, charm and overall a sense of reality which in a film that occasionally becomes far fetched is an excellent achievement indeed. She is incredibly expressive. Most of the time she doesn't even need to say anything. Her face says all we need to know. Some of her expressions are just priceless, and I can honestly say I have never, ever seen them captured on film before. i'd be 'more' than a little surprised if she doesn't become more of an 'international' star in the next few yearsThe film features a wide range of genre's. Although It is primarily a Romance Comedy film, it also has a dash of action courtesy of the girl's 'Scriptwriting' hobby. This leads to all manor of imagined scenarios staring Jeon Ji Hyun. Be it parodies of 'The Matrix' in her 'Demolition Terminator' story, to an 'Ashes Of Time' style period swordplay movie later on in the film. These scenes, while not exactly furthering the plot are really well done, and a nice little break from the main story.My favourite aspect of the film is how the director gives little hints and tips as to what is happening in the story without actually telling us. Each and every small detail (Which at first may seem trivial or pointless) will come back to play a major part in the film later on. Apart from being a really neat little way to tell the story, it also makes the film nearly infinitely re watchable. You can come back to it again and again and you'll always notice something new which enhances the plot. By the time you get to the midpoint of this film you 'will' care for these characters. As it approaches a more touching, less comedic, romance angle you wont lose interest. It's clever, funny, touching and romantic.The only people who may not like this will be those allergic to romantic films. Even then, I feel you may just be surprised. I cannot recommend this film enough. If you don't watch it. You only have yourself to blame.", "My sassy girl is a movie kind of old indeed, I have it since it went out on DVD, because every movie I hear good comments I buy it, but honestly I didn't see this movie until yesterday, I saw the directors cut which is  minutes longer, so the movies reaches  hour  minutes, and there wasn't a single minute that I got bore, the movie is the perfect mix of comedy and romance, the comedy part doesn't seems to happen because of forced situations, they are more like things that could happen to your or me. The movie is son engaging that I saw it yesterday and I cant stop thinking about it, honestly I'll see it tomorrow again with some friends, because people usually do not like to watch foreign movies thinking that only Hollywood makes good movies (and that is such a mistake).The actors are cool, honestly in the beginning of the movie I tough common these  are the stars? but then you realize they are perfect, casue they seems to be  normal everyday people, not HOT STARS with perfects bodys (I ended loving that girl), the chemistry is perfect, the two of them blends together so nice that I could believe that everything that happens on the screen is real.The Score, WOW, I already had to buy it, the music was like I was playing some Final Fantasy game, That means that every music you hear fits perfectly to the scene.My only concern is the remake Dreamworks is doing, that scare me, doing a movie again just cause Americans don't like to watch movies with Asian people? bad very bad, I feel sorrow for them, I am glad I don't have that problem and I can watch this movie the way it was envisioned.One advice: WATCH IT NOW!!!

It's unique and worth watching. <"], "Sentiment Score": 0.7675000000000001}, "1326": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["A Love to Kill is a  Korean melodrama that starts off with a poorly directed and convoluted st episode, and that's just the beginning of its problems. I don't want to bash this show too hard, as I want to try to be objective, and the series does have a few good things going for it; It's an interesting premise to base a show on, and I appreciated its attempt to try to convey a more darkly themed love story compared to the norm for KTV melodramas. There are several solid romantic and dramatic moments, and many sad ones, throughout, but you'll have to wade through a considerable amount of filler and nonsense to get to them. Ultimately, there are just too many issues that affect this show for it to be considered one of the better Korean melodramas.SPOILERS AHEAD!So, where did it go wrong?...I'll tell you: The primary problem with this show is that it simply can't sustain its  episode length. I frequently complain about Asian productions being way lengthier than they need be, but this series might be the most egregious offender of this issue that I've ever seen. As a result, its pacing is often incredibly sloooowwww! This is a constant and reoccurring problem that effects this show on every level; several episodes don't progress the story at all, plot lines seem to drag along indefinitely, etc. This issue even manifests itself in many individual scenes; someone will say or do something and a good  seconds or so will go by before the other party responds, characters frequently reminisce or stare off into the distance for an interminable amount of time, etc. This all becomes excruciating to bear with as the series plays out, and I frequently found myself begging for something anything to happen, or for someone to do or say something, in order to get this show moving along at a more expedient pace. I understand this is supposed to be a slow burn dramatic tale, but that's no excuse for it to be a tedious and boring watch (which it often is).The premise of this revenge love story is intriguing, but could they not think of a better way to implement it?...Essentially, this story involves a male lead character who wants to get revenge for his older brother's suicide (which he blames on the actress his older brother was in love with). Let's set aside the fact that any reasonable person would realize that this is not the fault of the actress, and just assume that the younger brother is filled with blind compassion and rage for his beloved brother. The only problem with this is that he hasn't seen his brother in over a decade, and he barely seems to know or care about him at all, so, it's rather unbelievable that he would be completely consumed with avenging him all of a sudden (despite how this show tries to explain to you why he is, via flashbacks to when they were younger).In order to exact his revenge, the lead character decides to get close to the actress by becoming her personal bodyguard. Why not just walk up to her and say Hi, I'm the younger brother of the guy you loved, and he's had a very bad accident, can we discuss the situation? He could have easily gotten close to her that way, instead of using this absurdly contrived bodyguard plot. Nevertheless, he somehow manages to become her bodyguard; I guess background checks were not a requirement, since the people who hired him have no problem with the fact that he has no experience, don't bother to make a simple inquiry to discover he was the brother of the guy they were trying to keep away from the actress, and don't seem to care that he's a violent and unstable psychopath who shakes down people on the street for money when he's not busy losing club fights on purpose. What, was Hannibal Lecter unavailable for the position?...Jeesh!There are a couple of secondary stories as well, the most prominent of which involves an heir of a major company wanting to marry the actress. This story line is absurd and unnecessary; the sole reason as to why these  characters should must be married is essentially based on a single innocuous misunderstanding that could easily be rectified by reasonable adults...sadly, the writers are children and thought otherwise!As for your actors; there's basically only  main roles: Shin Min A plays the part of the actress. She's usually does pretty solid work, and she does what's asked of her here well enough, but this is not a role that does her any favors. Rain plays the lead here; he has legions of fans, but at the risk of being beaten to death by a bunch of fan girls, I'm just going to say it: He's not that great of an actor, and I've been less than impressed with many of the roles I've seen him in. His range primarily consists of being angry, sad, distant, or goofy (with, seemingly, very little room in between). He's certainly good looking, athletic, likable, and, he can do a wide variety of things, but IMO, he's lacking the nuances and subtleties needed at this stage of his career (now ), in order to be considered the preeminent new wave actor that so many people once claimed him to be.This show wants to be an epic sad love tale meets revenge story, but it's not! Instead, it's an overwrought and underwhelming melodrama that features an unlikeable main lead and some badly contrived story lines. If it were   episodes long, and helmed by a more solid writing team, it could have been a lot better. Ultimately though, it never rises above the level of being just a mediocre soap opera at best.Bottom line:  out of  stars. If you are looking for a Korean melodrama of a similar vein, there are many other shows to choose from that are far better than this one.", "I had extremely high hopes for this series as it's Rain's newest work and since I have seen Full House and Sang Doo! Let's Go To School which I thought were outstanding, I didn't expect anything less   in fact I expected it to be a life changing thing! Haha. I was worried that I was going to be disappointed because I had such high hopes but it amazed me and managed to blow me away.Using non verbal communication, you can tell from the cover that it's very serious, Rain's character is going to be very cold, and just from the title you know that the story is going to be exciting and epic.Even though it's not the first time this kind of story has been done, it still seems so original because it seemed so fresh.The thing I enjoyed the most was seeing a completely different side of Rain. If you're a Rain fan from such series as Full House, don't expect to see the sweet and gentle Young Jae you saw. Rain's character, Bok Gu, is cold, UNBELIEVABLY smooth and has the attractive 'bad boy' attitude. After watching this, I was convinced that Rain can act any role because he just nailed this character. There is nothing worse than when you're watching a film or series and you don't care about the characters. You won't find that in this \u0096 you will genuinely care about the characters, pity them, hate them, understand them, be frustrated with them and fall in love with them.You also cannot ignore the incredible music used in this. The music alone touched me and broke my heart   it was so effective. A superb soundtrack.Girls must watch this series for the excitement of the development of the  lovers' relationship and see what ending will come out of this completely against fate scenario. And most importantly, in all seriousness, no joke, Rain's handsomeness. The shots used for all the characters were done so unbelievably well \u0096 I melted every time Rain came on screen.Guys \u0096 get ready for a new role model. There is also so much action in this \u0096 it's more than a drama. Also, follow all the courting steps in this series and you will melt any girl's heart you desire.All the cast's acting skills were generally extremely good but hands down to Rain who once again holds nothing back and always gives it his all.The ending is beautiful and at first you may find it very unsatisfying because you needed more closure but I was thinking about this series for days (along with tears \u0096 yes it was also very sad, heartbreaking and really touching) after I finished watching it and I found that I loved it more and more. It turns out to be such a brilliant story and it's a must see. Definitely another brilliant piece with Rain.", "Its been two days since I watched the ending and I still can't stop thinking about the it and being sad. Damn ending was really depressing. Especially after the excellent acting and character development made me really care and worry about the two lovers. Its quite rare that I actually care about the characters in these sort of dramas, but this one did the job. Never thought Rain was such a great actor.Story line was very engaging, even though not very original. I like the fact that none of the characters are evil, rather they are all driven by their own sense of love, friendship, guilt or loyalty. Yet, the course of events and misunderstandings forced them into confrontation and emotional conflict. The road to ruin is paved with good intentions. Easily the best drama I've watched in years, but extremely heartbreaking. :(", "*WARNING* spoilers. To avoid them, but still read this otherwise un spoiling review, skip down past the fourth paragraph down that begins with on the scale of originality and enjoy this review :) There are a few things to be said about this drama: First off   I won't lie, I only began watching this because I knew Rain was in it. And come on, lets face it   what girl isn't in love with Rain? lol. But after watching the first few episodes I realized just how incredibly deep and touching this drama really was.Aside from being good looking, one has to give MAJOR credit to Bi   his acting is amazing in this drama, as it was in Sangdoo ya Hakyo Kaja. It is hard to believe that this is only his third drama   he acts like a pro. His sad scenes moved me to tears, his romantic ones made me go awwww and be even more in love with him than I was (which is saying something) and his funny scenes (which were scarce in this drama, i have to admit, but still effective) had me burst out laughing. He displays many complex emotions throughout this drama   from violently angry to determined, stoic, grief ridden, genuinely happy, and confused   all of which he shows with remarkable skill. All in all, Bi's acting as a lead truly helped this drama be amazing. One thing I was particularly impressed with is that he doesn't overact his sad scenes or force emotions that aren't there, as many novice actors tend to do (i.e. the fake, tearless cry) but rather pulls from memories of his own painful past to recreate the emotions the character should be feeling, giving way to a very genuine, touching performance of grief.The same can be said for Shin Min Ah, whose innocence and smile light up this otherwise fairly depressing drama. The supporting cast does a very good job as well, and particular emphasis should be noted for Lee Ki Woo, who skillfully managed to turn his truly detestable character into a likable one in just  episodes.On the scale of originality it could definitely be higher. Anyone who is familiar with the writing of Lee Kyun Hee (who also wrote Sorry, I Love You and Let's Go, Sangdoo,) knows that she generally follows the pattern of portraying a tragic love that is too strong to endure on this earth   Ijuksa, for the most part, is no different in that sense. And many typical Kdrama clich\u00e9s are implemented in this show, it's true. But different scenarios between characters and more complex relationships between them make a very tangled web of love that I, for one, have not ever seen the likes of yet. In short: you'll recognize some elements from other dramas, but you definitely won't be bored.Finally   the music. To put it simply, this drama's music is outstanding. Full of piano and vocal tracks whose melodies will embed themselves in your mind for days and not leave even if you want them to, and others that will make you tear up after the first chord, the soundtrack to Ijuksa is heartfelt and will bring back many memories while listening to it.All in all this drama is truly worth a watch. It's touching, romantic, and lovable.If you are looking for a cheery, light, fluffy drama, I wouldn't recommend this one, simply because it is very deep and tugs at ones heartstrings quite often. But by the end of this drama, I can guarantee that you will be sad to part with these characters, all of whom you undoubtedly will grow to love.Two thumbs up for Ijuksa. :D", "I won't give away the story most of the reviewers have told you the basic storyline. However, my spoiler is revolving around Bok ku (Rain's character) and Da jung (Sa rang Kim) the reviewers are right this story is about Bokku wanting to get revenge on actress Cha Eun suk for his brother's tragedy.However, as the story progressed I grew to dislike Bok ku more and more. He moved between Da jung who he claimed to love and his obsessed love of Cha Eun suk. Da Jung had been in a fire and I am not sure who saved who but she fell in love with Bok ku. Throughout the story he continues to lead her on a path that suggests the two will be together that he will not be like his brother overwhelmed by Cha Eun suk. There is nothing to hate about Cha Eun suk her character isn't evil in any real way she just throws love around very easily. First with Bok ku's brother (who she doesn't know why he disappeared on her) then suddenly to Bok ku and when he asks about her previously love she answers it's been so long she can't remember.All the while Da Jung has done the unspeakable for Bok ku by using the photos they discovered of the real live relationship of his brother and Cha Eun suk to blackmail the actress to pay for his brother's hospital care.I understand a lot of Asian movies, dramas, etc don't like to have neat clean happy endings but this one was just wrong.Da Jung I felt sorry for although a close friend of theirs Mi Suk is in love with her she never leads him on she tells him upfront she wants Bok ku and no other. In the end she gives up to Cha Eun suk because she knows Bok ku will never look at her as anything he promised to. That part made me cry. After the two had gone out together and he called her his Da Jung and how she was perfect for him and they together to be betrayed was just the wrong way to go with the story.I am writing this only because it truly bothered me. I know it's melodrama but geez have a bit of sympathy for the girl who has saw you through some of the worst times instead of rushing off with the same obsession your brother had."], "Sentiment Score": 0.70875}, "792": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["This is a beautiful Korean Drama TV Show. It's actually my first and I'm very impressed by the acting in this. Sulli from f(x) and Minho from SHINee are so good and are probably the best. Sulli being the boy is actually quite believable despite her showing some of her female side throughout the show. Minho comes out as tough and serious. He does it perfectly well, and when the time for him to be all funny and different, he does it so naturally you'd think he wasn't even acting! The supporting cast are great too. It has so much funny moments that just make you laugh ill you cry and sad moments that make you cry instantly. The music soundtrack are also very impressive and come in the right moment! It's amazing how they do all this, I never expected this much. I clearly underestimated the Korean Entertainment Industry!

Other than that, the drama is just, well, boring. To be honest, I'm still trying to finish it, while picking up It's okay its love (note, SM idol again plays in it). However the story does not appeal to me, so it's hard to keep watching it after the third episode. Honestly, I'm not a big fan of any of the idol groups of SM, and I didn't really recognise any of them easily, so, for me, this drama is just like any others. The story sounds okay, though the first episode doesn't really explain why the girl chose to dress up as a boy and attend the school. It was hinted that she may have a crush on the lead actor, but she actually hasn't, as it is revealed through the next episodes. She just admires him and wants to help him. Her acting though isn't that good, and the situations where she almost has her identity revealed, which should have been funny and awkward, are just bad. To top that, the romance is bleak, with the two actors showing no attraction for one another. Maybe the only thing that kept me going was actor Hyun woo Lee, who's one of my favourites, though he even couldn't save this drama. So  out of .

No evil clown lurking under the streets of some small town...I can also overlook such reality as well. So what can I say? Well plenty. This is one of those shows I can sit through and not understand a stinking thing anyone says. It actually is that kind of shows. I don't know Korean at all, so I am at a loss as to what they are talking about. Thank you Mr. and Mrs. Subtitles...you save the day. Honestly, this show is so well done, the humor is visually translated very well. Gotta love clarity in comedy. 'To the Beautiful You', is better than swell, it is smurf a liciously good.

Seriously, why don't you find someone who at least can act a little so that I didn't have to pull my hairs in frustration during the whole time watching your show. This show makes no sense at all. The plot is super messy. It's just like they threw a bunch of random things together and hoped it'd work. But it didn't. I don't even know why I wasted my time on it.

I liked the chemistry between the actors, and it's very easy to tell that they got along on set. I also enjoyed the comedy of this, I found myself laughing a lot during it.The problem is mainly with one aspect of the show, and unfortunately it's a big one. The writing for this is awful. The choices that the characters are not only nonsensical, they're choices that no human would ever make. The main story doesn't flow, and there's a huge plot shift part way throughout the show. There's also this mystery which I already knew the answer to the first time it's brought up. Another thing which got over very irritating was the music, whenever the characters were silent they would play this music which would describe how they feel. Seriously, we know what's going on, we don't need this music.I'll talk about the four main characters. The main lead's is one of those clumsy characters you either love or hate, I personally found her irritating, this type of character was done much better in other shows such as Ugly Betty. The male lead...okay I guess, though the actor wasn't as good as his costars. The second female lead had the best subplot, and she has several interesting dilemmas. But the spotlight was stolen by Choi Siwon's character, Shin Hyuk, mainly because the man was hilarious and the character knew how ridiculous everything going on was. Seriously, Shin Hyuk needs his own spin off, that's how funny he was!Overall, this drama does have some good moments, but if you're going to watch it throw logic out of the window.", "Much, much better than a fairy tale. If the childhood with its tales passed, behold there are movies like this, that can say a delightful story with pleasant, trustworthy people.A series truly like a tale, very, very originally, about a childhood love fulfilled after fifteen years, after a special series of events, rarely sad, the most are very funny. In addition, much common sense in this series story. I really like that is no knavery, grudge, selfishness. I'm fine with sincere and friendly solutions, I love happy endings. There are many beautiful, delightful, intelligent, funny scenes. I could see some scenes often, never bored. All the story is well thought out and developed; like a puzzle (some in movie's plot) in which the parts hang together. The main character Hye Jin(actress Hwang Jung Eum) is acting perfectly, no secondary character to surpass. I found that is good so. If I have to nitpick something it would be this: I'd have liked character Sung Joon (actor Park Seo Joon) to be oldster in the final scene with his daughter; The series could very well be called ,,The Umbrella''.A series that can bee seen even for the many funny scenes.", "She was pretty, as the very name suggests, is about a girl who used to be very pretty and rich. However growing up, she turned out to be ugly and poor, struggling to find a job to pay off her college founds. On the other hand, her ugly child friend, who happened to be her first love and had moved away years ago, which resulted to them loosing any contact, comes back as a handsome, successful man. Needless to say the drama is full of awkward situations and clumsy romance. The first episodes are very entertaining and the romance seems promising. But the love triangle, for me, ruined the drama. Plus, the protagonist kind of changed when she became pretty again. She was more independent and loud and tomboy when she was ugly, and then she changed her clothes and became all girly and cute and fragile. And there were things that remained unexplained, like the the male leads tend to not hear anyone when he was reading from his computer. Anyway, it was an okay drama so  out of .", "Where is the charisma, charm and comedy brilliance of Classic Hollywood? All those souls realizing Hollywood has descended to the least common denominator have taken rebirth in Korea.Joen eum Hwang is as charming and attractive as Cary Grant, her over the top comedy expressions are as funny as Gene Wilder or Madeline Kahn, her expressions of love and caring are as sincere as Audrey Hepburn. She plays a unique combination  a sexy and charming model type who is also a funny looking hilarious clown. I didn't expect there could be another talent of the calibre of Ji Hyun Jun, but I was wrong.She is supposed to be playing an ugly character, nominally indicated with outrageously fake clown freckles painted on her cheeks, but she is drop dead gorgeous and terminally cute. The other players also do great, especially the many supporting characters that are spot on and totally convincing. Jun hee Ko, her close friend, was brilliant with a difficult dramatic role. Other reviewers have favored Si Won Choi, who played a kind of crazy,lovable joker, always playing practical jokes. His character was as exaggerated as Hwang's, and provided a counter balance to her eccentricity. I didn't think his few moments of sincere feeling were as real as the other main actors. The other main character is her love interest played by Seo joon Park, who is credible but it's tough to make an impression while Hwang is busy chewing up all the scenery.The premise is along the lines of Ugly Betty, but the plot lines as far as I can tell are totally different.Other reviewers have criticized the plot as having unbelievable coincidences and character decisions. Classic comedy from Plautus, through Shakespeare and Billy Wilder, uses plots based on unlikely coincidence, mistaken identity and complicated love triangles frustrated by people's deceptions. That's how the genre works to portray human behavior in a condensed, engaging format. The character's choices were mostly believable enough, for me, given their many insecurities and hang ups. If people didn't often helplessly do stupid things there could not be any movies at all.What I liked about the story line was that many complex story lines were dovetailed together supporting each other, all supporting the arcs of the main characters. I also liked how how the characters and situations evolved into a continuing story. The series contains its own sequels. It doesn't follow the Hollywood formula of a single big climax.You wont see much skin or sex beyond holding hands and kissing. The characters follow a strict and hard to believe pre marital moral code. They also have a strong work ethic; one main message of the series is that everyone should work very hard at their corporate job to attain success through team effort, which will bring happiness. It's the opposite of subversive. The outcomes for everyone are very predictable from the beginning, which is how it should be in a screwball comedy. The fun is getting there.", "Jeong eum Hwang is a gifted comedian as well as actor. Her physical comedy is of the same type as Jerry Lewis, but it works better for me. Where Jerry Lewis' neurotic character makes me cringe with discomfort for his pain rather than laugh, Hwang's neurotic character while panic stricken and shaking with fear nevertheless comes across as being strong in spite of that. Her physical comedy and her mugging is inspired... funnier to me than Lucille Ball, in the same class as Madeline Kahn or Claudette Colbert.Beyond that, though, she is able to mix up completely straight acting, heart warming and genuine, with outrageous clowning and make it work. She is supposed to be ugly, but it's a comedy, and the fact that she really looks like a model made up like a clown, or Little Orphan Annie, is part of the fun. She is actually gorgeous with very fake painted freckles and a frizzy hairdo to provide a pretense of ugliness.Korean cinema is producing actors like Hwang and Ji hyun Jun who rival Hollywood's classic best in charisma and talent. All the actors did a great job. Si Won Choi carried off his own intensely over the top comic role.Someone said the story was illogical. Classic comedy from ancient Roman times to Shakespeare and right up to the great screwball comedies of the 's and 's is all based on an engine of preposterous coincidence, mistaken identity, and entangled love triangles. It's wildly improbably but the conventions of the genre allow it to highlight aspects of human behavior that are dead accurate, compressing lifetimes of intensity into a few hours. The exaggeration and compression is what turns observations of human behavior into entertainment.In fact compared to the comedic plots of Plautus, Shakespeare or Frank Capra, I found She Was Pretty to be much more believable as well as more complex and intricate. Several people thought the plot was unlikely, that characters would not make those choices. I found them very plausible. People in intense emotional relationships, and even in distant work relationships, don't make rational choices. They don't make good choices. At least from what I have seen, people do dumb and self sabotaging things more often than not. The reasons the characters give for their actions might in some cases seem a stretch, unless you consider the strong emotions of fear and shame that drive them. The soundtrack was also criticized. I enjoyed it. Lyrics are sung loudly right over dialog, where the lyrics are classic songs expressing the emotions the characters are going through even as they are barely able to acknowledge it themselves. I thought that was unusual and creative and that it helped to communicate the great timeless feelings people have about romance. One of the themes of the film is panic, panic attacks, both from trauma and from love obsession. The examination of psychological stress and the support of friendship gives the series a weight beyond just making us laugh, although it did that for me very well.One of things Korean TV is not is subversive. Don't expect insightful social criticism or political commentary. The story basically exalts conventional Korean social values, as well as the worship of fashion and conspicuous consumption, in spite of some egalitarian themes. These writers would not have had to worry about being put on the Hollywood blacklist ( ). Nor is it Monty Python or Douglas Adams, comedy that is often built on brilliant philosophical questioning. The Korean Wave is strictly pop culture as far as I have seen... I gather a sort of Confucian social conservatism and conformity is a Korean national value. Have only watched about   of it so far although as such comedies go the outcome is % predictable after a few episodes; I don't expect to be surprised. I don't want to be.

The Thornbirds, Roots and other early TV mini series were long movies broken into consecutive episodes. I love a mini series as a melodrama that tells a story in the long movie format, as opposed to those that tell different stories in the same setting (like Grey's Anatomy, Mad Men and to a lesser extent Damages, Breaking Bad, and Revenge that change the story at times while keeping to a general story). In this regard, I have discovered some gems in the South Korean TV mini series of recent years.The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back. This me recur in the same story. Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved. If personality dynamics are properly depicted in a valid manner, and if the production is skillful, powerful emotions can be evoked in the viewer. In this way we can live many lifetimes through movies, in our one lifetime   greatly enriching our incarnate experience.These South Korean productions (seen on Netflix streaming) are first class with excellent production and direction, some terrific casting and acting (particularly from some of the females who give some matchless world class performances), brilliant musical accompaniment, and staging. What makes these so good is the way they skillfully evoke deep emotion in the viewer. South Korean movie making is superb   world class.However, the following caveats must be considered by the USA viewer. They are subtitled and some people hate this. The South Korean cultural norms, values and sanctions may sometimes seems silly or old fashioned to the USA viewer. The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation unity   sometimes reminiscence of a old Frank Capra film.Most importantly, in order for the sometimes complicated sub plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing, and this leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people, that sometimes seem to be unlikely by USA cultural standards. The viewer may wonder at times why good but trusting people are so easily manipulated and deceived by bad and selfish people, but con artists do often succeed (just look at politicians for example). However this poetic license of improbability is needed to develop the story   just accept it as occurring even though unlikely at times.

Five Fingers. The Scent of a Woman. The Great Queen Seondeok. A Hundred Years Inheritance. Lie To me. Roof Top Prince. Dr. Jin. The Great DoctorFive Fingers is a  South Korean TV series that is a heart wrenching trip for those who watch all  episodes. The beginning episodes set the stage for the emotional fireworks that follow (and develop to the end). The plot explores the complexities of love, hate, revenge, and reparation. If you can immerse yourself in the unfolding drama, it is an emotional roller coaster ride. The many twists and turns in the plot are sometimes implausible as noted above, but ignore this and enjoy the ride.", "A woman raises two children, one of which is biologically hers.

While I enjoy some of these darker films like Oldboy, Mother, and I Saw the Devil, it's refreshing to see a Korean film that doesn't leave you feeling sick or depressed after the curtain falls.This movie has the usual themes covered in coming of age stories, but also deals with other issues relevant to modern Korean society, such as the treatment of foreign laborers and the disabled by a Korean culture that isn't always welcoming to outsiders. All that said, the highlight of this movie is the relationship between Wan Deuki and his teacher. This is the source of a great deal of humor and warmth throughout the movie, and will make you laugh out loud more than other Korean movie I can think of.

This movie is not like any other Korean film that I have watched, but it is a lot like the Japanese classic Ping Pong and it is a lot like American coming of age films such as The Freshman, Breaking Away and The Graduate and the Australian movies Muriel's Wedding and Strictly Ballroom, i.e. there are plenty of belly laughs, a few tearful moments and a sense that what you are watching is universal.Anyone who watches this looking for another Shamo (I love Shamo, btw) or similar martial arts film will be disappointed. While it starts on a downer note, it ends on a spiritual emotional intellectual high. I can not praise it highly enough.

The building of the bond between the student and the teacher goes in a pretty much narrow direction. I was more interested in the romance between the teacher and the next door neighbor. But that was disappointing as well. Overall this is a disappointing movie about a teacher trying to motivate a student..

Yet still not leaving the essential romance. Reminds me how actually there is more to Drama than just a Romance. I am one of the audience who look more of Law & Order Crimes Family in a Drama. Human needed critical & fresh knowledge in a work of art. Just a personal subjective opinion. However, the character of Artificial Intelligent is also being well played by the main Actor. Hopefully the final episode will be as promising as the initial episodes.I also have read the unusual reason behind its Title are you human too?As in Dramafever said ,\nIt's an artificial intelligence (AI) robot whose ever behavior and emotion is programmed to be 'as if it was human.' But unlike what the android robot was taught, humans can use each other and throw each other away in ways that are inhumane. That's why people experience loneliness even in a crowd.Furthermore, Among these people, the android robot is designed to listen to people until the end, help the weak, and comfort the crying. He is a very humane robot living among inhumane people, that raises the question of what it means to be human. We hope that people can have the courage to say to people who betray the ideals of humanity, 'Are you human, too?'So the question is really directed at those people who, despite being born human, nevertheless lack the compassion and behavior associated with humanity.       dramafever.\nMajestic!

Everything about it from the plot, to the acting, to the scenery. Amazing. This show meshes love into a political account and makes it just amazing.Each character has their own thing you like about them. It even made me cry, like I never cry. The soundtrack is also amazing LOL. You find yourself taking sides in each situation and even just falling in love with the masterpiece of the plot. This does follow history some what. But yea   Every episode makes you want more and more. Absolutely amazing. I will definitely re watch in like  years. LOL I wish there was more", "Empress Ki is a fictionalized account of Yuan Dynasty's Goryeo born Empress Gi Qi. The best part of the show was the acting. The two main leads Ha Ji Won (Empress Ki) and Joo Jin Mo (Wang Yu) were wonderful as well as the other cast members. However, it is Joo Jin Mo who steals the show in every scene with his strong delivery and intense eyes. Other noticeable performances came from Jeon Kuk Hwan (El Temur), Jin Yi Han (Tal Tal) and Baek Jin Hee (Danashiri). The first  episodes were fast paced, dramatic and humorous with great action sequence. But the last  episodes were rushed, low budget, illogical and laughable, but I still give this show a  out of  because of the earlier episodes. The worst part of this show comes from the last four episodes where every major character dies one cruel and unnecessary death from another. Was it really necessary to kill off Maha, Yon Feisu and Wang Yu in such ridiculous manner? And why would Kolta and the Empress Dowager betray the Emperor Togon? And yet, the worst part was when Emperor Togon becomes an alcoholic and loses his mind and has hallucinations and his judgment becomes greatly impaired. The show is still worth watching because of the acting, however, the actors deserved a better script in the end. Maybe the show would have been better off if they ended it with  episodes. There is no point of continuing a show if the intention is to rush for an ending.

The story involves a lowly kitchen worker who wants to become a chef, the head chef as the romantic interest, and a ghost who wants to settle her grudge. There's also a murder mystery angle involved.SPOILERS AHEAD!Our story revolves around  young women; one is a lonely restaurant assistant who has a crush on her boss, but is too shy to act on it. She also happens to have the ability to see ghosts, which ain't helping her any in her personal or professional life. The other woman is a ghost who can't find her way to the afterlife because she's resentful that she died a virgin. She can't remember how she died and doesn't really care at first., she's just looking to inhabit any living woman she can in order to lose her virginity so she can finally leave this world. Ghost girl meets living girl and discovers that the chef she has a crush on is one of the few living men who can handle her supernatural sexual powers. Thus, ghost girl plans to quickly enter living girl's body to have sex with this chef in order to satisfy her desires before departing earth forever.What happens here is ghost girl periodically inhabits living girl in order to accomplish her main goal (i.e. getting laid). This creates all kinds of problems for the living girl, as she can't remember anything that occurs when the ghost girl takes over her body. Furthermore, these two women are polar opposites in terms of their personalities; living girl is timid and lethargic, and ghost girl is an aggressive loud mouth. Thus, everyone around living girl now thinks she's suffering from some multiple personality disorder as she switches back & forth from quiet & reserved to boisterous & outgoing (depending on whether her body is being occupied by the ghost girl or not).Unfortunately for ghost girl, this chef she's trying to seduce has old fashioned values and wants to take the slow approach to a relationship. She just wants to hop in the sack with the guy, but he won't acquiesce, and this frustrates her to no end. Left with few options, ghost girl and living girl team up in order to find a solution for each of their separate problems; ghost girl helps living girl blossom as an all around woman and win over the man she likes, and living girl allows ghost girl to continually try to accomplish her goal while also helping her out in other ways. It doesn't take long before these two girls become BFF's while also balancing out each other's personalities.Everything is going according to plan, but problems eventually arise. Ghost girl starts falling in love with the chef over time (which was not her intention), and living girl discovers that ghost girl's grudge may not be related to being a virgin at all. There's also an attractive career woman vying for the chef's affection that must be dealt with, and someone who might be inhabited by an evil spirit that eventually represents your main antagonist on several fronts. From there, it's just a matter of following along with the story to see how everything will play out.As usual, you need to give these K dramas some breathing room to see how they evolve before casting judgement. The first few episodes are a little rocky but the story does settle in quickly, and it's mostly entertaining for the bulk of its run time.There's a lot to like about this story and this show, and it's helped greatly by the performance of the two lead actresses. I'm quite familiar with Park Bo young (who portrays the living girl, and is the main star of the show), and she just kills it in a role that requires her to start out acting on opposite ends of the spectrum and slowly blending them into some middle ground over time. Kim Seul gi plays the ghost girl, and this isn't the first time I've seen her play a bit of a manic character in a supporting role, but she's quite good at it, and somebody needs to give her shot at as a lead actress asap. These two actresses drive this show from start to finish, and they interact so well that you'd think they've been working together for years.Jo Jung suk plays the chef and lead love interest. He's fairly likable and effective (especially when compared to the asshole head chef character portrayed in 'Pasta') and, of course, he's pretty easy on the eyes. The rest of the cast of characters not mentioned above consist of the ghost catcher lady with a soft spot for the ghost girl, an assortment of fit subordinate chef dudes ranging from reasonable to obnoxious and that get shirtless for no reason (other than to obviously appease the female viewers), along with a few others of import.This show utilizes several cooking related segments throughout, and a few ghostly special effects as needed, and while both of these of aspects are employed rather sparsely, they do serve their purpose. Production values are solid enough for this type of show, and it's competently written and directed as well (though you'll have to excuse the lack of rules of what a ghost can or can't do). There is a bit of lag during some of the middle episodes, but not so much that it doesn't comply with my number one rule for any K drama (i.e. Don't Be Boring!).Summary: Is it great?...Of course not!. But there are a number of things to like here. It does ultimately work quite well for what it is, it's also pretty well paced, and there's a nice mix of drama, humor, poignancy, suspense, love, etc. Personally, I thought it was very nicely done!Bottom Line:  out of  stars on the K Drama scale!...Solidly Recommended!", "I've seen many, many dramas; many good, some bad, others just forgettable. There are those I consider great, as in classics. Dramas I've seen twice or more, and will probably watch yet again in the future. Which is saying something because these things are often like watching + hour films. Secret Garden, My Girlfriend is a Gumiho, Lovely Kim Sam Soon, Hello Agashi, Cunning Single Lady, Healer, My Love From Another Star...well there are a bunch, and this is no exception.It's a bittersweet love story about moving on, letting go and overcoming obstacles. This drama nails the balance between humor, drama, thriller and the macabre. The acting, direction and writing are all top notch. The two actresses who star in the drama are stand outs   especially the main gal as she plays two completely different personalities flawlessly. If you are a fan of Korean dramas, or are new to the genre, this one is a fantastic watch. Highly recommend this one!!!", "Oh My Ghost! has a great premise of a young, shy, timid girl (Bong Sun) who can see and even communicate with ghosts. Petrified and harassed, she finds herself constantly tired due to lack of sleep and doing her best to avoid these pesky spirits! She even goes so far as to cover the walls of her tiny apartment in talismans and anything else that might keep the spirits away.Enter Soon Ae, a ghost who spends much of her time eluding the local shaman (Seobingo), who can not only see and interact with spirits, but she can catch them too!Bong Sun works at a restaurant under a nationally recognized chef who is constantly scolding her for her lack of attention, lack of energy, and most importantly, her lack of confidence. Constantly apologizing, she drives Chef Kang crazy, as well as her co workers. Once again, after being chased by Seobingo, Soon Ae takes possession of Bong Sun, and this is where the fun begins! Through the sudden habitation of Soon Ae, Bong Sun's personality is altered. She's confident, not shy at all, and even demonstrates innate cooking abilities, much to the shock and surprise of Chef Kang and his fellow cooks. Of course, the series is about how Bong Sun and Chef Kang will come together, as he's completely caught off guard by her sudden forwardness and flirtations. The series is a complete delight! I can't say enough about Bo Young Park's performance. She's able to switch personalities of Bong Su and being possessed by Soon Ae with all of the deftness of a master at her craft. The beauty of this is that Park is equally charming in both roles. She is so cute and adorable, that you love her in either part. Her charm is what drives the series. Of course, there is also a mystery to be solved regarding Soon Ae and how and why she died. Her story is just as interesting and intriguing as Bong Sun's. In fact, it can be noted that her story is touching as well as tragic. So much so, that you may find it hard to choke back a few tears. Seul Gi Kim does a magnificent job in this role. The series is a perfect balance and blend of drama, comedy, suspense, and romance. The four cooks who work under Kang are a perfect fit when a laugh is needed. They are hilarious and they work off each other so wonderfully. The entire cast is to be commended. There really isn't anything contrived at all in this series. The plot flows smoothly without anything feeling forced. I've seen too many plots where the writers and the director loses sight of the story and feels that they have to come up with something that is scarcely believable or plausible. Oh My Ghost! is a terrific series that you may have a hard time stopping after watching just one episode. You'll find yourself laughing a lot, shedding a few tears, and cheering in the end for Bong Sun and Soon Ae. Both of them realize that the key to Life is to Love. Because without it, Life is pretty dismal, whether you're alive or a ghost!", "This is one of the best korean drama i've ever watched! I really love Park Bo Young Characters! We can tell the difference when she plays the role of Na bong sun and the ghost. And for the Chef, he's so full of charisma! I'm starting to like him a lot < A lot of viewers are more liking the love between the ghost and chef. But i'm not. I really ship na bong sun and chef! Na bong sun really likes him a lot. She even made a scrap book about chef. And from my point of view, chef also likes her from the first time he saw her. At first, he acted like a bad guy because he thought that na bong sun shouldn't be a shy and always say 'sorry' to everything that she'd done. He didn't want her to be like him in the past who always got bullied by his school 'friends'. So he's hoping that she will do her best for herself. and this drama is really worth to watch. You won't be disappointed.

I think it's only thanks to the skills of Lee Byung Hun, that this series managed to be so good. Although there were also some genuinely mean performances by a couple of other villain characters, as well as a couple of slightly farcical and not so good characters.Usually, the romance thread is the main point of the Korean drama series. They introduced the fictional romance between Lee Byung Hun's character and that of Song Hye Gyo against the gangster backdrop. The  became real life lovers during the production of the drama   now broken up. You can see on screen that the two really like each other, but as for Song Hye Gyo's character of 'Angela' on screen, she didn't seem to have a lot of substance and I wasn't convinced why Kim In Ha should go nuts for her. You also have to believe in the nature of extraordinary coincidence   a common feature of Korean drama series   to be convinced that the couple should be reunited on SO MANY occasions in various parts of the world.For me, the stronghold of the series was the rivalry and backstabbing between the gang members. I especially cheered at the fate of the vampire esquire Dae Soo character. Such a theme attracted a lot of male members to the audience   not something typical of most Korean drama series. I also think the series can appeal to many on an international level. They have on location scenes in Las Vegas including some foreign actors. The gambling skills picked up by the actors was also impressive.All In is a great drama series to get started in.", "Having seen lots of K Dramas, this one is bit slow paced and the twenty four episodes could easily have been told in eighteen. The story is what holds this together and I wish the characters were better developed (especially over the course of  plus hours) and the direction could've been swifter (there are lots of long ( seconds plus) shots of an actor just standing there, which makes the viewer press the 'scan forward' button). My biggest gripe with this SBS production is the English subtitles. I don't think anyone needs or expects them to be perfect, but these were so bad, to the point of being distracting and ruining the mood (on the other hand, most MBC dramas have great subtitles).", "The story develops slowly.

Mind putting  more coin to call the cops? No you do not call them. You tell someone on the road to call the cops? Nope ! You go to your house where the bad lady is in. At the entrance there are people. You tell them to call the cops? No you don't. The cops are at the entrance because they found a dead body. You inform them ? No again. You go in your house. You are in the kitchen. There are like  knives. Do you want to be wolverine ? No bare hands are better. You are again in the kitchen.  knives in front of you but yeah just take the lighter cause yeah it is obviously a better choice. You are the wife. You manage to hit the bad lady barely unconscious. You snap her neck? You kill her? Nahhh no way just walk away. The best character is the boy. THE  YEARS OLD BOY. seriously this movie has more holes than a cheese... This movie has nominations and awards. REALLY? I am furious with this thing. Really furious....", "Despite the few twists and turns. This movie was corny and annoying. I was just sitting there for it to get better, but despite the crisp cinematography it was annoying and dull to sit through. Sure it has it's creepy moments, but that isn't enough for this movie to be worth a watch. Gosh the male lead is the most annoying and wimpy character I have seen in a horror movie ever. The guy is a super wimp. Nothing against guys that are physically weak. But the guy was so annoying to watch on screen. Even his wife and kids have more balls than him. No wonder why girls dislike wimpy guys that can't fend for themselves. Now the character decisions. Sure, when it comes to horror movies there is usually a lot of characters that make some really bad decisions. But since the characters are frantic all the way through while making really bad decisions which made it even more annoying. Sure it does have that creepy vibe going for it, but it lacked the tension, suspense and thrills. It's watchable, but you won't be missing out or anything like that if you didn't watch this..

It is a difficult film to watch at times, and it does take a while for the film to get going.I'm not going to put in any spoilers but if you do not want to know anything at all about the film please just accept that it is worth it and stop reading.Im trying not to sound to geeky but imagine if David Mamet (glengarry glen ross, Ronin) wrote for chan Wook Park (old boy, lady vengeance) and you would know what I mean.OK, so half an hour into the film I thought it was just another murder film, but it really is so much more.It is not perfect by any means. the police seem clumsy at times and the film gel as well as it could, but this is all for a reason, and that reason is shown in the  minute finale which is better than anything Hollywood can do. It is the type of ending that has you literally hiding behind a cushion one minute, then jumping up and cheering the next.If you liked lady vengeance or dark water, this is a film for you, if you like good cinema that makes you think then again this is a good movie for you.Park may be the fashionable director at the moment, and rightly so if you have seen his films, but Eun jin Bang who directed this film is definitely one to look out for. Also, you should watch this before Hollywood remakes it, which no doubt it will at some point.I just liked the movie, and I hope more people give it a go.", "In Seoul, the thirty three year old Jung Sun jung (Jeong hwa Eom) sees an abusive stepmother beating up on her stepdaughter in the bathroom of a department store and she stabs the woman to death with a stiletto. Detective Oh Sung ho (Seong kun Mun) interviews the little girl and watches the tape of the surveillance camera of the department store, finding the lead of Sun jung. However he does not disclose his discovery to his partner. Sun young works in a car dealer of Porches and then she kills a young woman in a massage house and later her lover in his apartment. The partner of Sung ho finds the sticker of cartoon character Princess Aurora in each victim and Sung ho meets and has sex with Sun  jung that is his ex wife. She steals his handcuffs and kidnaps a taxi driver, killing him later. Then she abducts and kills the son of the owner of the restaurant Hanseung. Sung ho finally discloses to his chief Byun Sang ho that the serial killer is his ex wife and their six year  old daughter Oh Min ah that they called Princess Aurora had been abducted, raped, killed and dumped naked in a landfill on the day of her birthday exactly one year ago. They discover that Sun jung has kidnapped the defense attorney Kim Wu Taek that had defended the killer Hong Gi  beom that was sent to a mental institution instead of prison. The police and the press head to the landfill where Min ah was found expecting to meet Sun young and her hostage.Orora Gongju a.k.a. Princess Aurora is another great Korean movie of revenge of a mother. The story is very well constructed, with an excellent screenplay that discloses the plot like a puzzle like most of the Korean films. The story begins with a serial killer murdering people apparently without any connection but in the end there is an explanation for each death. The direction and the performances are also top notch. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): Princesa Aurora (Princess Aurora)", "For those of you that like the amount of cruelty and bloodshed in Lady Vengeance, this film will seem subtle.The acting of the female lead is convincing enough to warrant the  minutes of it.At first, the movie seemingly revolves around a young woman who kills mercilessly for justice. However, as the story continues, her actions became methodical and preempted. Only at the very end of the story do we actually get to know the angst, grief and pain that forced her into such a state of mind.This movie, although Korean, also reflects on the other Asian societies where wealth, materialism and self centredness are overshadowing the importance of kindness and virtue.", "In an interview with cine magazine director Pang Eun jin refers to her film Princess Aurora as a melodrama, and a very dark one at that. Unfortunately, too many people have been fixated on comparing it (often unflatteringly) to Park Chan wook's Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. The two films have very little in common, in fact. Pang's film is a movie about grief, and the actions of the lead character are more representations of that overwhelming grief than they are about getting even. There's none of the emphasis on careful plotting and methodical execution that we get in Lady Vengeance   just a series of seemingly unconnected crimes. In this sense, the film is more like Hitchcock's Marnie, or Truffaut's The Bride Wore Black than it is like Park's film. Indeed, the sequence in the hospital seems to be a clear reference to Truffaut's film version of the Cornell Woolrich novel. The performances in the film are all first rate, and the single flashback sequence toward the end of the film (the flashback that explains the motivations for the lead character's actions) is both heartbreaking and horrifying. Princess Aurora is a commentary on Korean society (e.g., the position of women in Korean society, Korean society's view of children, etc.), not a simple story of revenge. Where Park's film is a overwhelming and spectacular, Pang's film is quiet and thoughtful  the type of film that will leave viewers capable of appreciating its subtle style thinking for some time. It is an underrated masterpiece.", "But not the best that has been produced in that land. If your looking for the revenge master, look no further than Park Chan Wook (or you can put the Park at the end, like it's done in Korea) and you'll get the best! Having said that, the story presented here is not bad. Not bad at all and the acting is quite good also. But the pacing, the rhythm and the overall flair of this movie, never quite feels right. The script could've used a few rewrites and I'm pretty sure, there could've been a few better fleshed out characters.

Moreover, she is more surprised to find that the man calls himself her father, having married her mother without telling her, and now demanding from her to treat him like her father as well. The story proceeds as the woman struggles to accept him as her father and she starts to discover alarming evidence about his past life. That's the first part. The second half, however, gets a little tiring and boring. The twists are obvious and not interesting, the love triangle is seriously weak and the romance gets a little held back by so many events and eventually, loses its power and gets boring as well. Other than that, the drama as a whole was funny, especially the times when the guy acted like an old man, had some interesting parts and the performances were good, though I would have preferred the leading lady to have acted more active when pretending to be happy (she smiled, but her eyes were boring).

It is a mix of history and fiction in telling the story of a South Korean spy agent who goes to North Korea under the guise of a businessman through China in order to infiltrate North Korea in search of information about the nuclear program.The movie's biggest strength is in the cinematography portraying the different locales of China, South Korea, and North Korea in its story telling and in the acting pulling in a cast of well established Korean actors. The camera work and soundtrack is also excellent which work together perfectly in creating high tension key points in the story and providing the movie with excellent pacing.The story is for the most part is more straight forward than what I expected from a spy thriller. It gets more political after the second half of the movie which is expected due to the nature of story between North and South Korea and it adds a level of complexity. What the movie doesn't do well is explain the motivation that drives the actions of supporting characters. The main character's actions were easy to understand but it was a little bit frustrating not understanding the driving cause of some of the other key characters.The movie ends with a clear message that will polarize viewers based on their political standing but it does so in an interesting way through the relationship between characters which does tie up the movie fairly well.

Sure, there are specks of unintentionally hilarious scenes, but I have no idea about the practices and implementation of laws in S.Korea, so I can't pinpoint things out for discussion.

A new teacher arrives, and offers his students the chance to come see him in the counselling room. Once the students are there, they make a deal and sign a contract with him to get something they want, and it all starts to look up for them. However it goes downhill for each student pretty quickly and always ends badly, and afterwards nobody can remember the students who signed the contract. The first  episodes focus on five students, two episodes for each student, and the last two episodes focus more on solving what is going on.The two main characters, Ye Rim and Sang Woo were awesome. Intelligent, funny, and caring, what more could you want? Ye Rim is class president so takes it upon herself to be responsible and find out why people are disappearing and Sang Woo, who has a huge crush on her, helps. I was rooting for Sang Woo the whole time, he was definitely trying his hardest to impress Ye Rim! Their acting was good, as was most of the cast's actually.Most of my problems with this was the plot. Each of the students who signed a contract with the teacher had very fickle wishes: popularity, beauty, a boyfriend, etc. I guess they were trying to make it relatable for teenagers but frankly all the secondary characters were just stupid. Who signs a contract in blood? They clearly don't think things through! Also the plot was a bit inconsistent, especially in episode eight when the boy who signed the contract seemed to be recovering and being independent and then all of a sudden for no reason he deteriorated again into his former state. The thing that ruined this for me was the ending (major spoilers ahead). Ye Rim is in the dream world trying to figure out what is going on, and Mr. Han pretty much tells her how to escape, so obviously she does. When she wakes up he just decides 'Oh well lets just forget this whole thing ammiright' and just rewinds all the events. This made no sense to me. If the dream place was his 'heaven' as he called it, why did he just get rid of it? Because one girl escaped, because YOU TOLD HER HOW TO? As none of the students remember it they haven't learnt their lesson so they're basically all going to be the same terrible stupid people they were before. It just made no sense and seemed lazy and rushed. Also Ye Rim and Sang Woo had remarkable luck to get this far anyway, seeing as he obviously knew they were sneaking around his office and could easily have called them out in it. Did he want them to succeed? But how on earth would that benefit him when they are jeopardising his 'heaven'? Why would he give it up in the first place? So many questions!Because I'm nitpicking, the other thing that irritated me were the weird camera angles. There were some odd zoom ins of Mr Han that were really forced and just didn't fit in.In summary, if you've got a few hours to spare you might as well watch it, seeing as each episode is only between   minutes.

By the end of the series you are sure to have more questions instead of answers, particularly about the antihero. The ending of the series is left largely open to interpretation where the viewer will try to piece together everything and come up with their own unique conclusions.

In the scene that we keep playing over and over in our minds, the more we want them to come together, and the fact that they just stand there staring at each other makes the distance between them feel like the distance is even greater and the place larger and thus the scene becomes epic.They are far apart... Many steps, many years, many lifetimes apart\u0085The third element \u2013 a genius at workThe third element is the tension of expectation that something is going to happen, that which we know is going to happen and that we longed for but is actually not there   yet. We know the next frame is what we expect to happen. From an art history studies point of view, this is very Boroque. The third element in the Boroque painting style is the missing part that is the next moment, that which is not in the painting but in the viewer's mind as an expectation and is often dramatically different from what is visible in the painting. This adds depth to the scene as there is a third element in the two dimensional plane. The expectation of a dramatic change to the whole scene makes the scene more emotionally moving and it leaves the viewer a more lasting impression. It evokes a lot more emotion from the viewer because the next moment is elusive. It keeps you thinking and longing for the next moment that follows the scene you are viewing. They will come together. The third element...And because of this third element and the epic scenery, the film reel in our minds will play it over and over   that they were apart but would come together in a very epic and dramatic way. They were finally close, but apart, or they were apart, but would come together. The last scene makes the viewer feel what Choi Yong and Eun Soo had felt in all those lifetimes, years and steps apart.I appreciate what the director had done for the ending. Anyone can do a kissing and hugging scene for the ending. But the director did something extraordinary   powerful, epic, emotional and lasting. He made us feel the frustration, the surprise, the longing, the faithfulness, the patience, the sadness, the joy, the gratefulness, and much more   all the emotions that went through the two characters   all in but one scene. How else would we feel everything that the two characters feel? How else could we have such strong feelings and a long lasting memory of the story that the director told? That is an unexpected and ingenious way to sum it up and end it for in this way, with the third element at work, it never ends.And this never ending and looping element is also another theme of the story   how many lifetimes of these two diverged and converged? Based on faith and love?Have you wondered why to this day you still talk about the story, still have strong feelings for the character and still want to view it over and over again? This is why. The third element at work.That was a genius at work. That was beautiful. That was his touch which touched my heart. And I discovered this at the tree.", "This is a drama in which the writer has deftly used the history, mythology, and Korean legends along with a bit of fantasy to weave a beautiful and powerful story.A Tale of Love across Time: The love story of Choi Young and Eun Soo is sure to tug the viewers' heartstrings. This love across centuries, love defying time, will be a hit among romantics. From making her learn the way of their world to protecting her from innumerable death traps, Choi Young is falling for Eun Soo, even though he knows he has to keep his promise to her, to help her return to her world. And Eun Soo changes her perspective from seeing him as her kidnapper to the only one she can trust in the unknown world of past, and to be with him becomes a habit she's reluctant to change. The gradual falling in love is beautifully portrayed in this period drama, while the question 'will she return?' refuses to cease anyone's mind.", "I have come to appreciate the emotions good Korean actors can emit in a scene. This series is so very well done, I'm hoping it continues. I found it on Netflix {I'm not trying to sell Netflix), and was thinking it probably is an adolescent series. It isn't that simple. The subtitles are obviously done by an inexperienced translator, which sometimes is irritating, but also can be very interesting for a native English speaker. The language the translator uses is very contemporary, using terms like punk etc., but I imagined from the get go that there was a meeting of the staff to decide if using contemporary language would add or detract from the series. I believe they made the right decision in one sense because viewers (and most likely they are as adolescent viewers as me, it's true} can get caught up in the exchanges between actors, Min ho Lee {Choi Young, the general, and Hee seon Kim {Yoo Eun Soo, the good doctor} as the love tension between them evolves, and there are some hilarious moments with these two as they struggle to hide their growing love from both themselves and one another. But I'm so curious about the archaic language that I might be missing because that language has always reflected the complex and brutal formality of the ancient cultures of the Asian societies. It's so very Shakespearean in his characters' consistent struggle to find one another in a feudal age where honor is everything to a male. But even with their use of contemporary Korean, I realize at this very instant, the power lies in a mixture of archaic expression with the contemporary kids, punks, etc., showing the exquisite complexity that one simple word can carry in the politics of the mind in a chess game or Go. As the first reviewer has said, it is very obvious the director tightens the series very sublimely as it progresses, moving nicely to much deeper themes than simply a love story or drama. I've been privileged to have seen some of the top actors of the series in other major films, and the impetus created by the story lines and stylistic methodology compels the viewer to keep watching for the next episodes.I'm amazed by the Korean theatre. It is very well established, and this series makes that obvious. The result makes for scholarly study of such a phenomenon as well as an enjoyable and even emotional spiritual experience even if it is adolescent at its core. Perhaps I'm simply a  year old baby looking at my past remembering in my own melancholy some of the finer things in my life. As a former film maker though, I cannot help but want this show to continue to evolve. So does it matter that perhaps it is a little adolescent while covering a sublime set of universal themes? there's so much more I would like to say here, but I guess I will have to write an essay about it. No room here.", "This is a good series. I wanted most of episodes    diligently then skipped to episode  or  and even then began following the plot but skipping along. Instead of providing high analysis I will just say, I wish the main characters embraced at the very end. To be correct I would have given it an . out of . Will definitely find other Korean movies to watch in future. Did not have the heart or time to thoroughly watch episodes   as it was more of the back and forth plotting and endangerment stuff. Definitely opened my eyes to some of Korean culture and historical drama. There are no outright make out scenes, but some of the replay views of the past help to continually reinforce the bond the main characters have built up. I also wish more US Western or UK stories were told from this perspective  not exclusively first person, always sticking the audience hearing in first person what the main character or characters are feeling."], "Sentiment Score": 0.9700000000000001}, "729": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "189": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "561": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "267": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1001": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1305": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "749": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["Queen of Ambition ( episode  Korean TV series) Here we go again; another poor, down on her luck, woman gets the chance to rise to wealth and status. I'm starting to lose track of how many of these similarly themed K drama shows I've seen over the years, and, there seems to be no shortage still being made. As the title suggests, this show squarely falls into the woman who will stop at nothing to succeed category.SPOILERS AHEAD!Our story begins in the present, where Joo Da Hae is the wife of Korea's President, and, Ha Ryu is a special prosecutor who's come to arrest her for her misdeeds. These two struggle with a gun until one gets shot (and is presumably dead), but, you can't tell which one takes the bullet. This all happens in the first  minutes of episode , and sets the stage for the story to come. The rest of the show is then told in the past, from the time Da Hae and Ha Ryu first met, on up through time, until they finally arrive back in the present.As the story unfolds, we're introduced to Da Hae & Ha Ryu in their young adult lives as they meet again after not seeing each other since they were children. They begin a relationship, and, they're both fairly likable and make for a really nice couple in the beginning. Things start to unravel for them over time though, and Da Hae soon morphs into a heartless witch with zero redeeming qualities. She eventually takes all of Ha Ryu's money and leaves him & their daughter for a wealthier man without even telling anybody. From there, Da Hae keeps on climbing the ladder of success while stepping on the throats of everyone she comes across.You'll find all the usual tropes that come with this genre; jealousy, family secrets, blackmail, allegiances, & power struggles are the norm. Even knowing what to expect, this show is often ridiculously over the top. Here's a sampling: (SPOILERS) Da Hae gets divorced, gets abducted, leaps from a moving car & goes on the run, cracks a safe & steals secret docs, slams her aunt in the face with a briefcase to make her escape, gives her father in law with the magnificently outrageous toupee a heart attack, gets her brother in law beaten to a pulp, tries to blow up her first husband with a car bomb but blows up her nd husband instead, and, sneaks off to America with the future President of Korea. All of this happens over the course of ONE SINGLE EPISODE!If that isn't enough to convince you how unhinged this show gets, this should do it: (SUPER SPOILERS) Da Hae also, directly or indirectly, gets both her brother and one of her husbands sent to prison, stabs her adoptive father to death and buries him in the woods, gets her own daughter run over and killed by a truck, kills at least one of her husbands in an accident, kills the brother of another husband and dumps him in a river, kills some unlucky medical examiner, and, kills some lady's horse for good measure. There's also various secret family bloodlines, murder suicide mysteries, identical twins, rigged elections, orphan back stories, etc. Whew!!!Your  leads are played by Park Soo Ae & Kwon Sang Woo; they're both experienced and solid throughout. Sang Woo plays Ha Ryu (& his twin brother); he does a fine enough job of portraying the pitiable man who becomes more obsessed with punishing Da Hae as the story unfolds. in addition, his body of work here is also sure to not disappoint the ladies in some of the earlier episodes. Soo Ae is the star though, and she makes for one terrific deceitful crazy woman in her portrayal of Da Hae; her role basically consists of flashing her inviting smile while simultaneously being a devious lying psychopath. She also gets the high fashion treatment throughout this show once her character is afforded some money. She looks great of course, but the sheer number of ensembles she's provided is astonishing; she practically has a new outfit to wear for each separate scene she appears in. I've never seen anything like it; even K dramas centered around the fashion industry pale in comparison to the massive wardrobe afforded De Hae's character here. But, you might as well be fashionable when you're busy killing and or ruining the lives of everyone around you!The secondary cast is suitable enough, but, they're all merely pawns on the board in the scheme of things. More or less, each of the two leads hatch various schemes to accomplish their goals, their efforts are summarily thwarted by the other, then repeat this scenario until we arrive back in the present to reveal the final conclusion. How it plays out from start to finish is outrageous and often amusing though; it can paraphrased as: Sorry your plot to burn me to death in a warehouse fire didn't work out yesterday, but I'll see you at tomorrow's board meeting where I will implement my next plan to destroy you!Ultimately, this is a tale about greed & revenge between a man and a woman; one that is almost completely devoid of any love romance angle once it hits its stride (which is a little unusual for a K drama). Despite all the killings and mayhem, it's really not that violent or action packed either. I honestly can't say this show is all that great, but it does have some enormous appeal on the guilty pleasure scale, and, I did have a good deal of fun watching it. If nothing else, I really have to hand it to the writers of this show for their relentless anything goes approach to overly dramatic storytelling.Bottom Line: It's awfully silly and beyond absurd, but, it's immensely watchable anyway (that is, if you're into this sort of thing).

As the series progressed I noticed that the series has a very good plot overall. It has all genres, suspense, romance, action and you could easily characterize it as a 'medical drama'.

Episode , didn't raise my hopes too much. There is a silly chase around a pillar, which I don;t think was meant to be funny. But as the show got on, it got better. It seemed to be a show that wanted to tick as many korean type dramas as possible from extreme violence to more light hearted fare, and in between. It was only as the show went, and no longer seemed to be going for extremes that it found it's footing, or perhaps I just got used to it. Acting wise. I thought Kang So Ra was terrific, followed by Cheon Ho Jin, who made a great villain. In I suppose what was the nominal female role, Jin Se Yeon was fine. But she's probably not as good an actress as Kang So Ra. In the lead role, Lee Jong Suk, came across as being one of the better pretty boy actors out there. Although I really had to use my imagination to think of him as a doctor, especially when he had that HAIR. What I was a bit confused by, was who was the main female lead. Was it Kang So Ra, or Jin Se Yeon. to me it was Kang So Ra, and the playful scenes between her and Lee Jong Suk were some of the best in the series. Park Hae Jin's performance came across as being rather one note, but maybe that was the character he played. Choi Jung Woo could have done with toning down his performance at times.

I simply enjoyed in every single romantic scene of them as they had the chemistry right up to my taste. You are going to love Yoo Ji Tae also. There acting is top notch.I did not regret watching this drama. One of the best Korean dramas I have ever watched!", "I decided to watch Healer because of my friend. She was absolutely crazy about it at the time it aired, and it was hard not to be interested while listening to her talking about it.I suppose I should mention that I wasn't quite sure about the main leads at first. I watched Park Min Young in two dramas before (City Hunter and Sungkyunkwan Scandal), and although I didn't dislike her, I wouldn't plan to go out of my way to watch her. My first encounter with Ji Chang Wook was when he guested in Running Man, during which although he was handsome, he hardly appeared as attractive.Good for me, I tried to keep being open minded. Apart from letting myself be affected by my friend's suggestion, I also watched a cut from an episode to see the chemistry between the two main leads. It didn't completely convince me, but enough to sense a certain level of their chemistry together   which I actually liked.So at a certain point, I kind of felt it was time and gave it a go. I kept my pace of one episode a day at first, not quite know what to expect. The first struck of emotion for me was in episode , then it bloomed in episode , and from then on it was pretty much an one way street, I couldn't go back anymore. Some days I watched two, or even three episodes at a time. My friend said, Well, that sounds about right.The thing I liked the most about Healer, surprisingly or not at all, was the chemistry between Seo Jung Hoo Park Bong Soo (Ji Chang Wook) and Chae Young Shin (Park Min Young) in the drama. They gave me lots of feels. I forgot them in real life and immersed myself completely into that fantasy world. It was rare since I hadn't been able to totally get into the mood of any Korean dramas as of late, let alone feel the romance and believe it was real. This pair broke the stuffy and frustrating air I was feeling for the past  years about Korean dramas in general. It was lovely, adorable, light, trusting. When you see those two, you simply genuinely want them to be together, not because they went through a lot and they needed to be together just for the sake of it, but because they deserve each other. Whenever I saw them, it made me all light up inside. Fluttering. Happy.Apart from the OTP (one true pairing), it appeared to me that everyone who took part in the project was putting their all in it, and they worked so amazing in harmony together that it also reflected on screen. Both Ji Chang Wook and Park Min Young were passionate about their parts, they gave lots of suggestions and really tried to understand their characters. For Ji Chang Wook's character   Seo Jung Hoo Park Bong Soo, I think we're bound to love him. It was a guy who was strong and intelligent and brave, and at the same time had this dorky and awkward side to social interactions (especially to Young Shin's father) that was super duper cute. For Park Min Young's character   Chae Young Shin, she did this type of character before but for the first time ever, something was different. She had a certain depth and comfort that made it easy and pleasant to watch. It felt like something just clicked. I get annoyed easily with unnecessarily silly and naive characters, but this time I actually liked Chae Young Shin a lot, simply because it wasn't that type. It was true she needed to be protected, yet to me it seemed that you didn't need to be strong all the time. If something was out of your reach and ability, it would be better to leave it to people who could handle it instead of fighting blindly no matter what. What would be wrong with receiving help when needed? Young Shin was brave whenever the situation called for. It led me to believe that the script was written logically after much thought. I'm pretty sure many people will have withdrawal symptoms after watching Healer, so I would recommend you to find what the writer Song Ji Na as well as the assistant writers had to say about it, plus listen to dramabeans podcast about Healer too. Also for the first time since forever, Healer managed to get my brain working on the insights it provided. What a feast.Now when I listen to Healer main theme song, it makes me want to go run through the rooftops. And when the first line in Eternal Love by Michael Learns to Rock turns up, I can't help but agree, yes, It's a beautiful feeling...", "Finally watched a rare Kdrama that doesn't look like an anime acting...

It's sad to see that some of you are too busy critiquing the lack of complexity in the plot, because it is this simplicity that makes this movie so beautiful. Since many of you have already reiterated the plot, i'll just cut the chase and try to clear up some confusion, hopefully.First of all, to understand why he let the girl go and turns against his boss, the flashback towards the end is very crucial. When she plays the cello, he smiles, and as he is dying, he smiles as he listens to her voice. These are the only two occasions in which he smiles throughout the entire movie. Whether this is love, attraction, or because he was thankful that she made him feel good, is open to interpretation. Given that he is an extremely straightforward and honest character(and also given that in this movie, everything is what you see on the screen  there are no hidden motives, twists, whatsoever), I assume that the reason he doesn't answer (or CAN'T answer) when asked why he did it by his boss is because he doesn't know himself. I think the key to understanding this movie is the title, and the narration at the end of the movie (something along the line of a disciple telling his master that he cries after a sweet dream because he knows it can't come true). For Sunwoo,the girl and his belief(?) that he can kill everyone else and still live are sweet dreams that cannot come true. The reason why he unrealistically gets by after getting shot and stabbed so much, is not simply because he is the main character, but because everything he does after meeting the girl is like a sweet 'dream', a surreal reality(yes, an oxymoron, just like the title  a 'bittersweet' life). The morbid ending is also very fitting  as sweet as the dream was, the more bitter it is when he wakes up from it and faces reality(once again relating to the last narration).", "This masterpiece comes from the director of Tales of Two Sisters and he delivers an epic tale of revenge.I can't urge you enough to see this movie. The gun battles are reminiscent of Scarface, the martial arts are gritty and realistic, the poignancy of unrequited love is painful, there is a deep philosophical current that underlies this film, and the camera work is superb but that's not what carries the movie. The actor who plays the main character is what sets this magnificent movie apart from the trash put out by Hollywood. He's a man's man sharply dressed in well tailored suits driving in a BMW sedan (like the transporter)through beautiful Seoul (showing what a beautiful, spotless, and vibrant city it is). He reaches the point of no return and his vengeance and determination are a tour de force.Magnificent. Bravo. South Korean films reign supreme.", "I could sit here and start this review off any number of ways to make this film sound ultra important. I could say, once in a great while a film comes along, blah, blah. Or, Only a select few films ever have reached this, blah, blah. Or I could say, if you see one movie this year, blah, blah. You know the drill. These are the opening sentences the big boy critics use when they really want you to see a flick and when they want a particular review to really stand out. Well, films that deserve this kind of special praise really do only come around once in a great while. Unbelievably, I have seen two in only six months time. The first was what I like to call the first real st Century film, and that was Oldboy. And the second film of this status also comes from Korea, believe it or not, and it is Bittersweet Life.Bittersweet Life is probably one of the most simple, most streamlined modern films I have ever seen. It is lean, mean, and like its lead male, a damn ruthless fighting machine. The film beats along with its Raymond Chandler like screenplay with all the jazz and style of early 's John Woo and with the energy and themes of Quentin Tarantino's grind house 's. Life plays with your emotions, making you care for the bad guy hero even though he is a vicious killer, and causes one to release tension through laughter when the blood starts gushing like a dozen ruptured fire hoses. Wholesale death, blood by the gallons, broken bones and multiple beatings with humongous pipe wrenches, two by fours, and lead pipes are on order, right after a heaping dish of innocent love and a guy trying for once to do the right thing.The plot, well you see, it's like this: you can see everything coming a mile away, the movie plays it straight, and follows the exact path you know it will and the exact path you hope it will. There are no twist endings, no complicated triple crosses, no hidden motives for the characters. Everything on screen happens the way you see it, and everything thing ends exactly the way you picture it. And this is a good thing. The film is so on track that it doesn't need a twist or a swerve to make you pay attention. It starts at A, ends at E, and hits B, C and D on the way there. Life is so steeped in its genre tropes of noir character and themes that the ending is know to all of us before it even starts. However, it's the journey that matters, and I'll be damned if you can find a better looking, more brutally violent journey anywhere.As much as I try to analyze the film, nothing comes to mind. And this is the purest of all compliments. The film is as shallow as the pools of blood splattered in the hallways, alleyways and run down exteriors of the sets. Often times a director feels the need to bog a simple story down with twists, and a deeper meaning to hide the fact that they are afraid to just let things happen because they need to happen. Bittersweet Life is not one of these films. It exists with its soul laid bare for all to see, and when the carnage is complete, you thank the film for being honest with itself. As the final credits roll you might find yourself asking, Is that it? Yes, that is it\u0097cinematic perfection.

And he says no matter how dark and moody it may seem, his new film ''A Bittersweet Life (Talkomhan Insaeng)\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af is no exception.''This movie basically deals with relationship breakups resulting from small communication breakdowns,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af Kim said during a news conference Monday after the preview screening of ''A Bittersweet Life.\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af Without calling it comedy exactly, sometimes audiences have to laugh at very serious or ironic situations, Kim said.Kim has shown his unique morbid sense of humor in previous movies such as ''The Quiet Family,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af a black comedy about a family who kill visitors to their cottage, ''The Foul King,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af a comic drama about an amateur wrestler, and one horror contribution work for the omnibus film ''Three.\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af Kim is also behind ''A Tale of Two Sisters,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af the psychological horror film that became a summer hit in .''A Bittersweet Life,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af starring Lee Byung hun from ''Everybody Has a Little Secret\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af and Shin Mina from ''Madeleine,\u00a1\u00af\u00a1\u00af portrays the desperate and brutal revenge of Sun woo (played by Lee) after he is expelled from his gang and comes close to being killed by his boss.Lee Byung hun is a hit man who falls for the girlfriend of his boss in the stylishly violent \u00a1\u00b0A Bittersweet Life.\u00a1\u00b1 Conventional ideas of causation are put into doubt in director Kim Jee woon's twist on film noire. ''A Bittersweet Life (Talkomhan Insaeng)'' is what Korean critics are describing as ''Action Noire.'' In it, he tweaks the traditional Korean gangster story line, presenting a work with film noire undertones and stylish cinematography.Sun woo (Lee Byung hun) is a revenging dark angel dressed in black. Gang leader Kang (Kim Young cheol) assigns Sun woo, his right hand man, to watch after his nubile girlfriend professional cellist Hee soo (Shin Mina) while he is away and find out about the other guy with whom he suspects she is messing around.The plot is complicated by Sun woo's existential decision to stray from the explicit instructions with which he is charged. He is cryptically told time and again to make good on a promise, but he never exactly know what that is.Much of the action occurs in the long shadows the sprawling megapolis Seoul casts. Here, the gangsters wish they were too cool to be killed. No friend can really be trusted as the good guys are not so good and the bad guys can be down right evil. Importantly, the motivation of his tormentors is shrouded in mystery.But the movie has been labeled ''action noire'' for a good reason. The stylistic ultra violence of director Kim is superb. The creepy fisherman killer represents a unique Korean twist on the classic film noire villain. Our hero is not a good, good guy either, and I loved that about him. He is not only tough, but also a stone face killer _ a tribute to both the director and actor's character interpretation.After all, gangsters should fight to kill, and that means sometimes going for the knees and other joints, hitting low and dirty to take the guy out quick. In general, the fight scenes were creative.

There aren't that many episodes to play around with and I'm glad it wasn't dragged out. I feel like the message was portrayed pretty well and I must admit, I was in tears pretty much throughout. The acting is fabulous and I would generally recommend this title.However... the ending could have been a lot smoother.

Boy, was I wrong. I don't think I've cried this much watching a show since descendants of the sun, which says a lot since I bawled like a baby watching that show.

The female lead became the complex character I wanted her to be in a way I hadn't imagined it happening. For a short drama it turned out to be a really good watch, there were no useless episodes, and it had my feelings in a twist by the rd episode.

I would definitely say the acting was good, sometimes even great. and as for the script, there weren't any supper cringe worthy lines or anything, also there were some surprisingly funny moments from minor characters and our male lead.There are some tiny details in the show that don't get fully addressed, but hardly enough to dissatisfy a viewer.Honestly with a little bit of tweaking this could've been a   drama, but for now  thirty minute episodes isn't too risky of an investment to try out a decent show.", "I'm watching the show for a second time now, and it's still an amazing show.

I still tear up time and time again.The ending where it's will they or won't they? Off and on again love, does Da in remember Tan? is very frustrating at first, but I think repeated viewings make it more enjoyable and fits the story quite well.I love everything about this show and i will watch it from time to time again and again.

This show basically ramps up the same action and intrigue found in Iris, but, it does so at the expense of providing the central dramatic themes that made Iris the more interesting and addictive of the  shows.SPOILERS AHEAD!I did not like this show as near as much as its predecessor, but I did still enjoy watching it. It only very loosely follows the events that occurred in the Iris series, and you don't really need to watch that show first in order to watch this one. Although, there are a couple of crossover characters involved that might make you scratch your head for a couple of episodes as to who they are if you did not watch Iris first. These Iris characters just got in the way here for the most part, and they did not need to be incorporated (somewhat clumsily, I might add) into this show.Frankly, this show would have been better off it if had distanced itself from being an Iris spin off in my opinion. It's not a bad stand alone action show on its own, that would have likely been much better thought of without all the inherent direct comparisons to some other show.This show gets off to a blazing start action wise, and it doesn't waste any time letting you know what you're in for. In the intro,  teams of secret agents are pitted against each other as they battle over a nuclear scientist who defected. Once that's wrapped up, they flash forward a bit, where various new crises are implemented by the baddies over time, while the good guys try to stop them. That's basically it!As with Iris, there are a number of organizations and persons involved that are good, bad, gray, or undecided. They add a few more organizational & personal angles in this show though (which were mostly redundant); this is not confusing per se, but it only serves to unnecessarily try to complicate the plot with very little benefit to the overall story. This show is by no means bad, particularly so if you're looking for an action series. There are a number of action scenes (several of which are quite impressive), and, the acting, production values, etc, are all above average. However, it lacks an underlying story with enough purpose to bring the entire production together to deem it a must watch show.; it ultimately just follows a continuing pattern of: intrigue plot scene, action set piece scene, romance plot scene, then repeat.It's decent enough to recommend as it does more than enough quite well. The first  episodes or so were, indeed, highly entertaining. This show gets bogged down quite a bit once the primary plot kicks in though. There's plenty enough talent and money involved to make it all work, and there are only a very few episodes that are poorly written, directed, or produced. I think where it fails a bit is a result of what seems to have been rush to capitalize on Iris. This show would have been much better served if the writers and story tellers were given some more time to think things through in advance, but that's the way it goes sometimes!Bottom Line: Somewhere in the   star range. It's mostly watchable (even more so if you're just looking for some KTV action). I'm giving it  stars!", "An agent (Woo sung Jung) is transferred to the National Anti Terrorist Service and must stop a secret organization from committing acts of terror. This series ( episodes,  minutes each) is a spin off of the Iris series (with different actors) and is similar in terms of its budget, high production values, and slick presentation. The difference, however, is that the first few episodes set things up as a brainless, high octane action flick with generic scriptwriting, bland scoring, and weak characters. It severely lacks the dramatic intensity that made Iris so addictive, but the major positive here is the action, which provides some excellent shootouts that are on par with (or even better than) most theatrical films. It's amazing what they did with a mere $ million. Soo Ae and Ji ah Lee provide some exciting girls with guns action early on, but grow passive afterward, which is kinda disappointing. The pacing is blistering fast thru the first  episodes but runs out of gas during the second  episodes when the action becomes sparse and of a much lesser quality. It's almost like the director got lazy and phoned it in, because things actually get pretty damn boring at times. This would have been awesome if it had ended after episode .", "Whose who of Korean dramas and films are featured here some aging stars, some pretty stars, some mediocre stars and some rising stars. But only one truly shines and that was Cha Seung Won who played the super villain Son Hyuk. Not only does he have a menacing voice, but he runs and shoots his gun like a true villain. It is a great portrayal intelligent, witty and charismatic. Jung Woo Sung plays the quiet gentle NTS agent who is the main character and the hero. He does not quite match up to Cha Seung Won's magnetism. A hero role can be rather bland at times and it maybe the hardest role to play for an actor. A hero role requires a bit more imagination and passion. While watching Athena: Goddess of War, I couldn't help but be on Son Hyuk's side. Even with all his evil villainy, he made the scenes captivating and worth watching.", "Disappointing spin off of the ground breaking IRIS. South Korean security branch, NTS, squares off against international energy terrorist cabal. Poorly acted, wrong headed direction, and a script with more holes than a rat infested wheel of Swiss cheese. The main lead is too young, and early on grins and mugs as if auditioning for teen boy band. A team captain is inept and foolish, as is a North Korean ex elite agent. Don't get me started on the bane of K dramas. The tears. Weeping, crying, sobbing like six year olds. Yet these blubbering basket cases safeguard the nation.There are exceptions, the chief being the Son Hyuk rogue baddie who excels.The director obviously knows action sequences, which are showcases. With actors, he seems clueless. As much as I blame the series director for foolish comic relief and histrionics, however, the main culprit is the ridiculous script. Long, gorgeous episodes in Italy   for no purpose. Two episodes in Japan, guarding a pop star   for no purpose. Double agents exposed, and then the duped side shrugs and says, Well, they're sorry, so back to work. Initially, the main villains are USA agencies, which is a wonderful twist, only that thread is abandoned.", "I haven't read all the reviews, but I read most of them. So I would say I'm in the minority, when I say that Iprefer this to Iris. The main reasons being, I think it has better characters, and to use words the director of nts uses, it has more light and shade in storyline and acting, The best acting came came from Kim Min Jong and the actor who the aforementioned employs after in a very funny scene hitting him in the face a number of times. There is a delightful scene between the two of them where they try to gain information by pretending to be who they are not. i also liked Oh Yoon Ah. This is the third thing I've seen her in, and the more I see her, the more I like her. She is not a great actress. But she is game, and wiling to try different things. She seems to like characters more than lead roles. She reminds me a bit of Cameron Diaz. Looking at her picture on Asianwiki, she looks a lot different. In Iris, a lot of the performances were rather one note. In this drama, at least some of the actors are given a chance to show they can do more than look very very serious. I thought there were some terrific gunfights Yes it has it's faults. There were too many people being saved in the nick of time. who the hell was oh yoon ha talking to on the phone after she had been out drinking with Soo Ae's character. A major theme of this drama is redemption. Some viewers might not like the fact that a character who they would probably prefer to be killed isn't, and another character who it would have been nice if they had lived doesn't. As regards the plot about the north Korean agent from Iris. There are also some very funny lines in this, mostly coming from the characters i said i like. The director of Nts also said something i found amusing.He says says something about NTs upholding justice, and then says you may find that cheesy and boring You would never hear the director of homeland security in  says something like that.Regarding the special.

The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back. This may recur in the same story.Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved.If personality dynamics are properly depicted in a valid manner, and if the production is skillful, powerful emotions can be evoked in the viewer. In this way we can live many lifetimes through movies, in our one lifetime   greatly enriching our incarnate experience.These South Korean productions (seen on Netflix streaming) are first class with excellent production and direction, some terrific casting and acting (particularly from some of the females who give some matchless world class performances), brilliant musical accompaniment, and staging. What makes these so good is the way they skillfully evoke deep emotion in the viewer. South Korean movie making is superb   world class.However, the following caveats must be considered by the USA viewer:They are subtitled and some people hate this. The South Korean cultural norms, values and sanctions may sometimes seems silly or old fashioned to the USA viewer. The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation unity   sometimes reminiscence of a old Frank Capra film.Most importantly, in order for the sometimes complicated sub plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing, and this leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people, that sometimes seem to be unlikely by USA cultural standards. The viewer may wonder at times why good but trusting people are so easily manipulated and deceived by bad and selfish people, but con artists do often succeed (just look at politicians for example). However this poetic license of improbability is needed to develop the story   just accept it as occurring even though unlikely at times. Taking these factors into account will help you become involved and emotionally engrossed. It was hard for me to quit watching at times so I often binged watched more than one episode at a time.I would rank these as follows but tastes differ and your rankings might not agree:     (hard to say which is best)Shining InheritanceWhen a Man LovesThat Winter, The Wind BlowsSecret garden.

A must see.The story seems pretty straightforward and quite easy to get into. A cross between Cinderella and she's the man. The synopsis tells the story.But this is not a Hollywood made show.It goes much deeper than that. Where this show truly excels is portraying the relationships of the different characters in the show. Maybe its my Asian background. But the way they portray it and decisions made comes so close to my own experiences that its downright scary and also very touching.I guess it explains the huge success of the show...who ever watched this. They will see a parallel to their own situation. From a difficult relationship between a father and a son, to a mother trying to balance her need to find a new partner and her duty towards her daughters.To me it was the start of the boyfriend girlfriend relationship between EunChan and KanKyul. It mirrors my own experience so closely. The calling game, the little games you play with each other that could lead to misunderstandings and fights. And all this because you are afraid of the strong feelings you have for another person. Not knowing how to express it or how the other person feels about you. The beautiful thing is...they take there time to portray this and it works real well.Where Hollywood stops with just the love story, this shows continues exploring and portraying the relationship behind the lovestory.I can't recommend this how highly enough.

Choi Han Kyul is the heir of a big food company, but his grandmother wants him to settle down, so she arranged many dates for him. After Eun Chan bumped into Han Kyul and was mistaken for a boy, Han Kyul decided to hire Eun Chan to be his gay lover in order to avoid the arranged dates. Desperately in need of money, Eun Chan had no choice but to accept. Han Kyul's grandmother also made Han Kyul in charge of a filthy coffee shop in danger of being bankrupt. Eun Chan begged to work at the coffee shop, and not long after, feelings start to spark, except, how would Han Kyul accept his homosexuality?It took me a while to get into this drama as I felt that it dragged in its early episodes. But as I went through viewing it, there is no doubt that this is a CLASSIC DRAMA. The First Shop of the Coffee Prince provides refreshing themes about homosexuality, self sacrifice, hard work,dreams,ambition,success,emotional and psychological issues that one may face in life. The story is one of a kind and not your typical Asian drama.Yoon Eun Hye,playing the tomboyish Eun Chan, played her role extremely well. Her chemistry with Goong Yoo, who played the confused Choi Han Kyul,is commendable too. Their chemistry was excellent. Both deserved their MBC acting awards for their work in this drama. The supporting cast is commendable as well. Aside from that, the soundtrack was magnificent. A must see Korean drama!!!!!!", "Let's start off with the weirdest thing. I'm Dutch, have no relationship with anything or anyone Korean, I just like Anime and J Pop K pop. While browsing through Netflix I came upon this gem. When I started first watching this show, about a week ago, I thought fudge it. I never saw a Korean TV series before with real actors, apart from the occasional Korean movie involving lots of fighting. Coffee Prince was my first encounter with a Korean TV series and boy, what a treat this is!As other reviewers have explained, this is all about the girl  needs job, pretends to be boy, falls for boss. The amazing thing about it is that these actors actually take you along their fantastic ride. At no point in this series I felt they were over acting. Every single actor is able to portray his character well and they truly develop throughout the series. This is no As The World Turns. ATWT doesn't even come close. This is real drama. You really feel with these actors, I even forgot they are actors at times! The episodes also take their time, running for an hour or longer which gives the actors and director time to really dig deep into their characters and situations. Characters develop during an episode and even more so over the course of the series.The struggle between the two main characters is a back and forth, a push and pull. Sometimes a tad annoying because you really want them to work things out and get together. But the things happening to them and in their relationship often provide roadblocks which must be overcome for them to go forward. The ways they deal with those roadblocks are recognizable for a normal human being. Nobody get's shot because they cheated. This is real drama.This series is totally captivating and had me interested until the last second. I only wish they would've made an episode about the marriage of the main characters too (and yes, I'm a man saying that...). It would've been the ultimate ending to the series if you ask me.", "The Coffee Prince shows love can cross boundaries (gender, economic status) and triumph. The love story is beautifully portrayed and makes Coffee Prince worth watching.The two leads embody the main characters perfectly. Gong Yoo plays Choi Han gyul, a rich aimless man and Yoon Eun hye plays Go Eun chan, a hard  working breadwinner for her family. Eun chan does not look or dress in a feminine fashion and Han gyul mistakes her for a boy. Their initial relationship is based on Han gyul paying Eun chan to act as his boyfriend to repulse the blind dates his Grandmother and Mother set him up with, as they want him to settle down and marry. Han gyul then is challenged to make a decrepit coffee shop profitable in  months (as co owner) and Eun chan gets a job in the coffee shop. It is wonderful to watch their ensuing friendship and love blossom. Han gyul struggles with his love for Eun chan as it challenges his concepts that love should only between a man  and a woman. The lead actor, Gong Yoo, goes all in on his character, Han gyul, playing crucial moments with intensity and elevating the entire drama. The lead actress, Yoon Eun hye, manages to be sympathetic as her character Eun chan continues her gender lie longer than necessary. The supporting characters of the drama did not grab me so their on  screen stories were not of much interest, lowering the overall of the effect of Coffee Prince as a whole. *SPOILER* When Han gyul finally allows himself to love Eun chan regardless of gender (episode ) it is the best moment of the drama and truly touching. *SPOILER* The finale episode is the weakest as we wait too long for the couple to be reunited, but all ends well.", "OK. I watched this show for the first time in . I was . I had just been whipped into phase of watching Korean Dramas by one of my good friends. Compared to the first Korean show I watched, which I also loved but for other reasons (Boys Over Flowers), this show seemed so much more genuine. (I have not included spoilers about events but I might have included spoilers about different character's characteristics. If that makes any sense.)First of all, the relationships weren't outlandish. There is no extreme hate between any of the characters in the show. No arch nemesis. The parents grand parents are more reasonable when it comes to the romance of the main characters than any other K drama I have seen thus far. The supporting relationship in the show is a refreshing, long lasting love between reasonable, authentic adult characters, which, understandably has some hiccups along the way. Second, the characters weren't to the extremes. I have seen so many dramas with bratty chaebol sons who wear expensive clothing and drive fast cars. Han Kyul is rich and spoiled, but his wealth is toned down so that he is a believable character. Eun Chan was believable too. She didn't beat up people twice her size and the actor wasn't fighting too hard to pass as male. She seemed natural and cool. Sure there are some wacky characters in this show, Mr. Hong, Ha Rim, Sun Ki and Min Yeob, but none of them do extremely garish things which ruin the mood of the show. Third, Gong Yoo is just great, isn't he? He is a very handsome individual and I quite like the ensemble of different facial expressions that he can pull (my favorite is the raised eyebrows). Plus, he still looks great ten years later!Fourth, Yun Eun Hye is terrific as this  year old tomboy. Her chemistry with Gong Yoo has not been surpassed by anyone in any other the other shows or movies I have seen him in. I must admit, after watching this, I haven't been able to bring myself to watch any other shows that she is in. I see her as such a boy, and without the short hair and masculine tendencies, her performance in other shows and movies always leaves me feeling a bit empty.The plot kept me on the edge of my seat right up until the end. I'm only docking one point. Half a point because the ending is lacking some, and even though I've watched the show through a few times, I'm always hoping there is something extra that I missed at the end. Plus another half a point for the scenes which I feel are unnecessary and cumbersome to the plot, like Sun Ki's story (sorry Sun Ki)."], "Sentiment Score": 0.6383333333333333}, "1149": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "306": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1155": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["Iljimae is an amazing story about a kid who goes out at night to rob from the rich and give to the poor.

OK no more attempts at jokes....The story is entertaining and cool from the first episode. The characters are varied and colorful. You'll end up liking all of them. There is tons of action but there is a lot of depth too. There is plenty of love interests, cruel twists of fate and murder mystery drama. I would recommend this show to anyone with a face.

There is a sequel called return of iljimae which is not as good but also worth checking out for people looking for more ninja thief drama.", "Alright, this review will be short and sweet...AWESOME STORY... + hours of fun, heart wrenching drama!... A complete MUST watch for any drama fan that wants some action, mixed in with romance and so much more! It is definitely something i wish i had on DVD to OWN... The acting and character development was actually rather well done albeit cheesy in a moment or two... At times it gave me a laugh, a tear of joy and sadness and a sense of excitement. All keeping me coming back for more and actually wanting to live in such a world.Now the music was pretty good and kept the flow of the story together rather well... but often music samples were overplayed during certain scenes, mainly during action sequences.ALL IN ALL, the series was a complete knockout! If you are looking for action, suspense, mystery, and a little dash of romance then WATCH THIS!!!!! I tend to watch only historical Korean dramas and this one did not disappoint. It relatively short compared to other historical dramas but there is no drag in the storyline. You will fall in love with all the characters and keep on waiting for the truth to be finally revealed.There's not a dull character in here. With the way that the interconnected story arcs are woven into what is ostensibly a pitch perfect action comedy drama trifecta that will hook and won't let go. You won't want to stop watching this one. So many great, colourful characters that are wonderfully acted, and well written. While it may start slow after an action packed first  minutes, the story will soon come to a rolling boil, as you can't wait for the next chapter of this series to watch. Expect some sleepless nights of just one more to quickly happen, should you jump into this series. It may cause some tired, red eyed mornings, but I'll guarantee, they're worth it. Iljimae is just that good.The ending is a bit confusing... but you needn't worry...so if you haven't seen all the drama yet, do not read this...because it will ruin the end, and the hole story! Its is really a awesome drama SBS so watch it ...after seeing it I had to reveal the ending... Iljimae wasn't killed, but in the end you will see that the assassin, stabbed Iljimae with Iljimae's sword, his sword had a dull blade ...remember his sunbae Kang kil had given him a dull blade on his sword and telling him it is not for killing...but to save lives...also no one was ever killed by that sword. The st scene in episode  is after his disappearance at the end of episode  was a fictional story told by the citizens as a way to preserve the history of Iljimae in there hearts, so the bow and arrow wasn't real (hence the invisible cloak he used to enter the building, come on in that day an age an invisible cloak). And if I am not wrong the child in the end of episode  is Dani's son she had with Seo Dol.PS: The Return of Iljimae played by the actor Joo Ji Hoon that broadcasted January  has nothing to do with this Iljimae. Same character name, but a totally different storyline.", "I really enjoyed watching this serie and fell in love with Korean cinema.\nDefinitely recommendable.", " :\nOverall, Iljimae is the pinnacle of Korean historical drama. Everything from the sound track, the acting and even the nuanced plot would, in my honest opinion, be unchallenged for a very long time for the title of most well made drama! It also has a lot of rewatch potential.Plot:\nThe plot is clear, with a steady pace of plot progression. The clear backstory of the protagonist, Yong, provided unwavering motivation for him to drive the story forward, hence there was a distinct end goal, drive and a compelling process in between audience could be entertained, moved by and feel sympathy for the main character in the process.The story also brings in the theme of class and tackles it brilliantly through the use of imagery and juxtaposition to emphasise horrid conditions of living, and allows the audience to side more with the anti establishment robber by painting a good villain. That said, this portrayal sometimes goes too far, making villains, most nobles that is, seem like one dimensional, greedy creatures with no sense of shame or any other emotions for that matter.The relationships in the film, be it parental or romantic, around Yong, were well explored and extremely moving. Yong's relationship with his foster father was touching and felt genuine, in part due to the script and the actor playing the father's brilliant constant look of concern, in part also due to the comedic relief he provided do separate him from the other characters with devious intentions. His death was a truly memorable and tear inducing moment in the film, which is a testament to how great the film was at portraying their relationship. As for Yong's relationship with Eun Chi and Bong Soon, it was less powerful but not underwhelming. It would have been better if the love triangle between the  could be resolved by the last episode.It would also have been an improvement if the last episode provided more of a closure. The show has built on a kind of dramatic irony of Eun Chi not knowing Il Ji Mae's actual identity which creates tension that begs for release the audience never got. It would also have been better if the final episode showed Yong, as a civilian, alive and well, rather than a pseudo ambiguous ending whereby audiences need to get confirmation from directors. That said, it is rare and bold for directors to choose to have a bitter sweet ending (bitter since Yong is unable to live with his friends and family for fear of hurting them, a sacrifice of a hero; sweet because he is still alive and actively seeking revenge) which is definitely commendable. < >Background Music: Songs and background music were very well scored and timed. The main theme was inserted during critical junctures of the plot which certainly made those moments more impactful. Certain elements of the music also fit the period the film was set in, the most memorable of which was Gingko Hillside. Not only has the songs helped advance the plot and shaped the audience to feel a certain way, they are also great additions to any music playlist to listen to every now and again. < >Lines and Line Delivery: Actors were perfect for the role and delivered lines in a compelling fashion. There is so much nuance in the dialogue and the script that makes every time rewatching the show feel like a different experience. Many instances of dramatic irony, foreshadowing, symbolism and general imagery made it feel like a literary haven with techniques seldom used in modern filmmaking. In addition, subtle cues and the discrete dialogue are refreshing as opposed to having every detailed spelled out to the audience in the script. Perfect!< >Special Effects and Choreography: To be honest, the film is visibly lacking in this aspect. Some scenes were extremely poorly shot with green screen it was almost laughable. One notable example would the scene in episode  with the ice hole. The fight choreography was victim to the common one on one fighting motif which is unrealistic and impractical. (This refers to the instances whereby the protagonist is heavily outnumbered but somehow is able to survive because enemies choose to fight him one by one rather than taking him on all at once.) That said, one redeems aspect about the fight choreography was that it was clear and easy to determine what was going on. < >"], "Sentiment Score": 0.615}, "688": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["I discovered Korean dramas when I watched City Hunter () on Netflix and quickly became hooked. I've seen over  since then and now watch a lot more Korean than American TV shows. The great story telling and acting make reading subtitles worthwhile. Two Weeks is now my favorite Korean drama because it has everything that makes Korean TV so compelling  high stakes, fascinating characters with interesting arcs, fantastic acting, great pacing, and lots of pretty people.A man living an aimless life one day learns that he has a  year old daughter he never knew about. His ex girlfriend has tracked him down because the little girl has leukemia and desperately needs a bone marrow transplant. When a blood test shows that he can save her life, he suddenly has a purpose for living, but then he is framed for murder because of the way he has been living. He has two weeks to prove his innocence (while being hunted by both the police and a ruthless assassin) so he can save his daughter and redeem his life.All the main actors are talented and good looking, but Lee Jun Ki is so outstanding, the series is worth watching just for his performance. He became a super star in Asia in  for his performance as the beautiful minstrel (clown) in the record breaking film The King and the Clown. Since then he has been (among other types) a playboy, a delinquent, a secret agent, a Robin Hood type legend, a journalist, and a Josean era magistrate who can see ghosts. Once again LJK is playing a role completely different from any of his previous roles and creating an unforgettable character.The Koreans like to give acting awards for Best Couple each year. There are plenty of great relationships in this story, but I wouldn't be surprised if this year saw the first Best Couple award for a father daughter relationship for LJK and the adorable little girl who plays his daughter. For all the great action and suspense, their relationship is the real heart of this story.", "Not to be missed, folks! This is so much better than about  's of all the K dramas I have watched so far, equaling  at last count. Jun Ki Lee leaves his pretty boy looks behind him after his military service to get into a modern story of a man who changes dramatically when he discovers he has a biological daughter he's never known about before, and that she is sick and that without his help she will die.I love the way Koreans have their characters grow and change and reform for the better. Petty gangsters become decent human beings. Fast women reform and become noble. It's very inspirational and you rarely see that king of process on American shows.The little actress who played his daughter was so adorable I wanted to capture her out of the screen and make her my own daughter! She was perfect for Jun Ki Lee. I always say they are the most loving couple in K drama history!", "If you like watching thriller series, this is perfect for binge watching. You will be glued to the story. If you are someone emotional too, you won't forget it. And if you love kids, you will regret not watching it. If you are new into the korean world coming with the experience of watching high quality British and American tv shows, and that's why afraid ( may be you have looked over the web and have only found out how beautiful ROMANTIC korean dramas are and that unfortunately is not your genre ), don't be because I was once there too not too long ago. This was only my second korean drama.", "Sometimes the preset premise can set a boundary in which creativity is limited. This drama Two Weeks comes close but is able to manoeuvre around just enough to be just good enough.The premise is about harden weakling ex con criminal who discover himself being a father of an  year old girl, and on top, framed for murder, reinvents and rediscovers himself in  weeks.The intricacy of the plot involves  unlikely scheming selfish villains, a female politician and an mob boss vying for one last big deal. Along with this a prosecutor who has been gathering evidence on these ; the ex wife of the ex con, the current boy friend who is a cop, and the  daughter who needs bone marrow transplant.The  weeks, marks off day by day, and the intertwining plot, scenario and relation setup is just complicated enough to build up tension. However, you know the ex con is not gonna to die, or the seeming dangerous plot points say.. in episode  will be escapable. (Since he has to escape until episode ).

But the main interest is the bulling. In this drama, it is handled carefully. showing all the forms that is can take and all its results. And for me, that was the best part of the drama. The love story, actually the love triangle that it develops between the girl, her sister's best friend, and the outcast of her high school, is really good, but it fails to be completed, as the final episode leaves you a little confused.

This is created by irresponsible people or situations or maybe by being forced to be created by the influence of money. Whatever it is, a great possible of a storyline that could have happened is totally destroyed because whoever responsible for the storyline dont know a thing about love. I mean yeah affairs happen. Yeah twisty personalities exist. But why add background music that is meant to be played while celebrationss or portraying true love scenario to the totally ugly form of emotion that is formed by betrayal in adultery? Am I missing something here? Yeah I too can come up on ways to accept and agree the storyline, but you and I both know its putting cream on crap. Or have the writers totally lost it?The actors did awesome job, and I like them for it. But this whole script needed only tiny changes to still keep it enjoyable and meaningful, even a drunk reviewer might be able to make that change if he knew the basics of love. morality aside, this is plain stupid. Did they think this will tug the audiences heart more? No, this leeches off undefended psychology of many viewers, while even better result could have been achieved without leeching off of these people. Where is humanity? And what is love? Or has it become plainly and cruely profit oriented? But that doesnt make sense as small changes could have made this drama equally or even more profitable. Or are they that dull? Or is this a satire, parody, or any noir or something? No!! clearly it itself portrays as a love story. which mean this is scripted by irresponsible people who know s*** about love. (sorry, no other way to convey it.)Or has money prevailed responsibility now? But this drama does show a family (su dooh woo's mother) who want value to their life over money. I positively am hopeful that in the next story the scripters write they keep in mind to add some value to the story.Being out of convention is good and keeps it modern, but destroying human personalities by knowingly or unknowingly creating irresponsiblity in audience is considered cruel and a crime (within humanity's jurisdiction).Yeah, plainly, this should have been a story about how their marriages got fixed even though emotional affair possibilies occured. Or atleast show a bit of concern for the kid when their parents split up. But instead, this story falsely portrays happy ending which will by all means is unreal and will be unhappy in real life.And KBS gives a best couple award? Well, the couple they chose are fake to the core, Untrue, and if they were real, they would have been unhappy for many reasons not even considered to portray in this drama. This is, on overall, a very low intelligent drama about an intelligent soceity, but unfortunetly created by professional and talented cast and direction. And somehow everyone agreed to be irresponsible, or were forced to be.Like another reviewer said, this writer shouldnt write anymore. (I dare say, he please become more responsible, and please realize that being responsible too will bring profit.). And I wish people became more responsible with what they participate to create in.Note: I dont know whether this review is going to be reported by the brainwashed fans, but I hope it still remains in the vicinity to help save the minds of atleast a handful of people.", "One of the best Korean drama I've watched so far.

I wanted to get a hold on the storyline and a feel for the character before seeing this movie so i watched the drama. it was absolutely brilliant. the main girl in there, Ha Ji Won, was excellent, she had this proud ness about her that was either endearing or dis likable, but to me she was such a likable character,even if she wasn't lovable, and the dancing was so beautiful, especially the sword dance and the calling for justice dance she did to save her lover.with that feeling i went into the movie, i knew from the forgo that the movie would be different, would have different feel and the character would be different too. but i never expected to not like Hwang Jin Yi, or find her a bore.But i did, she was so utterly boring and the director tried way to hard for the viewers to feel sorry for Hwang's situation that it really ruined it for me. one of the reason the drama was so good was that Hwang in the drama was never portrayed to be a sympathetic character, the path she tread was the one she had chosen, she had no one to blame but herself, she never asked for our sympathy, and we don't feel the need to give it to her.the movie's Hwang was the total opposite, we see her as being forced into the situation, taking crap from people and being betrayed by her best friend then abandoned by him. all the makings for a sympathetic character, but although i did feel sorry for her as would anyone with a bit of compassion in them but felt like a cheap shot. and i was left feeling like I'm been forced into the feeling.what really did me in the most, was the fact that Hwang was suppose to be renowned for her beauty, intelligence and artistic nature in both drawing and dancing, the movie only portrayed her as a beauty with some brains, there was any particular scene that made us go 'wow she's so smart' and the most damming of them all, no dancing.the worst thing this movie did was being un memorable, it was such a shame, as i expected it to be much better.if anyone has the chance, skip this movie and watch the series, but if you want to watch both then watch the movie first, there is no way you can stand this movie if you've already seen the drama. one of the stupidest thing i did was go watch the drama first."], "Sentiment Score": 0.885}, "1227": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1299": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "92": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "605": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["I just watched this movie and it was one of the best series starring OK Bin Kim ( beautiful Korean actress ).

It's workable, but there are some problems.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Mi ri and Hee joo arrive separately at an orphanage as children. They get to know each other, then Hee joo is soon off to be adopted, but Mi ri ends up being the one adopted instead by mistake. A short time later, Hee joo is also adopted by a different set of parents. Then, flash forward in time to when these two girls are now young women. Hee joo got adopted by a great set of parents that enabled her to get a stellar education and basically lead a normal productive life. Mi ri got adopted by some degenerates though, and she had to grow up under less than ideal circumstances. Mi ri eventually escapes her crappy existence and reunites with Hee joo by chance. The  young female leads soon get involved with two male hoteliers, and the story is off and running from there.Mi ri is played by Lee Da hae (the main focus of this series). She plays the woman who's determined to get by on hard work & persistence going forward in life, but she has little choice to fall back on her street smarts & looks just to survive. Her actions soon lead her down a path of continued success born of small lies at first, then bigger lies, then outright greed. Mi ri is someone you'd like to see succeed because of the crappy hand in life she's been dealt, if only she would just cease devolving into more and more of a manipulative person that can't stop working every angle & person she can to get ahead.Kang Hye Jung is the other female lead who's cast as Hee joo. She's the cheerful & hard working girl who's poised to soon get her big break as an aspiring design artist, if she wasn't a complete klutz who can't ever seem to get out of her own way. She welcomes Mi ri back into her adult life only to ultimately find that Mi ri is really not a very nice person. Nevertheless, she does her best to help Mi ri due to the past debt she feels she owes her (for the adoption mishap that occurred years ago), and, just because she's simply a warm hearted person. Hee joo is easy to root for, but you do want to slap some sense into her for letting Mi ri walk over her time and again. She clearly needs to stand up for herself and start taking charge of her own life.Kim Seung woo plays male lead #  (Myung hoon). Myung hoon is a no nonsense hotel manager who's fresh off his divorce from his rotten ex wife when he rebounds into a relationship with Mi ri. Considering his recent romantic experience, he should've seen through Mi ri from a mile away, or been somewhat leery of her motives at the very least. I guess some men never learn though; he's all too willing to fall victim to the whims of another pretty face who offers a few kind words when he's vulnerable. You hope this dude will get it together before he gets in too deep with Mi ri.Park Yoo Chun plays male lead #  (Ta ka). Ta ka is the young heir to the hotel chain that's soon set to take over the hotel that Myung hoo works for. He pretty much has it all, but he quickly falls for Mi ri too. Once Mi ri finds out who he really is, she sinks her teeth into him quick and hard, and, he's powerless to resist her charms. He should also know better to fall for Mi ri (just like Myung hoon) , but Ta ka is a little young & dumb when it comes to true love, so I guess he can be given a pass in regards. However, he's also clearly an idiot for not realizing that he should be with Hee joo instead; she likes him, and she's pretty and kind and honest, and the two of them would likely make for a great couple if only Ta ka could get his head out of Mi ri's ass long enough to realize this.Our four main leads are thrown together, and it's just a matter of time to see how far Mi ri will go; will she make it to the top, will her lies destroy her and everyone around her, will she be able to make amends for all the trouble she's caused, etc?Story is pretty solid and moves along nicely for a good chunk of this  episode show, that is, until the pacing hits a wall past the midway point and the plot eventually starts spinning out of control! DAMN YOU K dramas directors & writers!...when are you going to learn how to bring these shows to a better conclusion on a more regular (and less ludicrous) basis?...There are eventually back to back episodes of  separate characters suffering brain injuries,  characters find out they're blood related (which was a hinted at story line that I was praying wouldn't come to fruition as feared), etc. All this climactic nonsense & poor final planning hurts this show significantly, and I'm downgrading it some as a result (because I'm really getting tired of this crap).I did like a solid majority of this show though, and the  main leads got their jobs done quite well, which is a big help in the overall scheme of things; I've also really taken a liking to Lee Da hae, in particular, over the years as an actress. I'm very much looking forward to see if she can pull off her lead role in the upcoming Iris sequel. We shall see!Bottom Line: this particular show is probably in the   star range. I'll give it a , because I am kind. It is really, really brought down by its final act, and all the nonsense that goes with it, however."], "Sentiment Score": 1.0}, "1240": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["Whenever I see a negative review of I Saw the Devil, the critic always mentions (scornfully) that the movie is ultra violent and portrays women in horrifying circumstances. Yes it is, and yes it does.But this isn't a Hollywood slasher flick. The kills in this movie are not gratifying and aren't meant to be. The women being killed are not scantily clad models running through forests from men wearing masks. There is nothing pleasant or cool about these scenes; they make the viewer uncomfortable, they unsettle, they bring one's mind into very dark places. It gives us a peek into the madness that every man is capable of, and does so realistically and without pulling its punches. This brutal realism makes people uncomfortable, and prompts negative reviews. This is understandable, but unfortunate. I believe that a movie should be judged on more than the amount of blood the viewer is comfortable seeing on screen. To these people, please, do not watch Korean revenge thrillers if you are uncomfortable with torture or blood.But enough of that rambling. This movie is excellent. Beautiful cinematography contrasts the stark, dimly lit scenes where the murders, or gritty fight scenes, occur. The camera work is simple but effective; the viewer is often treated to close ups of both Byung hun Lee and Mik sik Choi, and their facial expressions tell us more than dialogue ever could. There is also contrast between Lee and Choi. Lee, clean and stoic, and Choi, filthy and madly expressive. They compliment each other very well, and play off of each others strengths effectively.The story itself is typical of revenge films, but fantastic in its execution. Lee's character experiences a profound loss at the hands of Choi's character, and in the process of seeking revenge begins to resemble the man he so hates. The line between victim and aggressor becomes blurred between both characters. This is where the film shines. There is no black and white in I Saw the Devil; the viewer is left with shades of grey.As for the acting, it was all done very well. As I mentioned, Lee and Choi work well together, and all supporting cast members did an excellent job. Choi portrays his character in an incredibly convincing manner, shifting suddenly from calmness to manic anger, but never in a way that feels unnatural or forced. Lee's character is quiet and much less expressive, but he does very well in showing immense amounts of emotion through just his eyes or subtle movements of his body. A memorable performance from them both.As for flaws, the only thing I can think of is the strange, perhaps unrealistic behaviour of the police. Lee is a member of the NIS, and is very skilled when it comes to remaining hidden, but that shouldn't make him untouchable when directly provoking police officers or driving on the wrong side of the street. Still, though, it's a very trivial complaint that isn't worth a deducted point.A confident   from me. If you are comfortable seeing serial murder portrayed realistically, and are able to appreciate more than just gore, please, do yourself a favour and watch this film.", "This movie is not for the squeamish, or the faint of heart. Censors claimed it was offensive to human dignity. These were the kinds of things they told the audience at the world premiere screening of the Uncut Version of I Saw the Devil at the Toronto International Film Festival last week. I had heard the movie was pretty graphic, but I never expected that it would push any boundaries. I turned out to be only half right. After finding out his fianc\u00e9e has been brutally murdered, secret agent Dae hoon (Byung hun Lee) is at a loss. With the help of his father in law, he sets out on a revenge plot to find the man who did it. He quickly finds the culprit, Kyung chul (Min sik Choi). He beats him pretty badly, but instead of killing him, he leaves him alive. He wants to stalk his prey, and exact his revenge slowly and increasingly more painfully.Going in with very few ideas of what I was about to see, I was startled and thrilled at the tenacious audacity on display from the opening scene all the way until the final frames. The film is a gritty, merciless experience that could never be truly recreated in North America. This is the kind of hard boiled revenge thriller you could only find in Korea. And to hear that even the censors there could not handle Kim Ji woon's complete vision makes the film all the more uncompromising and astounding. It has taken me well over a week to try and come up with the words to describe and review the film, but never once have I forgotten anything I saw. It is quite simply, unforgettable.I was right in assuming the film would not push the boundaries of what can be shown in regards to graphic violence and gore. But it comes really close. It makes Park Chan Wook's entire Vengeance Trilogy look about as violent as the Toy Story Trilogy. Blood sprays, flies, drips, gushes \u2013 every verb or way blood can possibly flow out of the human body occurs over the course of the film. It relishes in it no matter if the shot is raw, unflinching and real, or hyper stylized and completely over the top. One sequence involving a brutal double murder as the camera swoops around the scene in a circle is simply magnificent to watch, both to see how much blood is spilt and for how wicked and incredible a shot it is.The revenge tale at the core of I Saw the Devil is not all too original, but it is the story and idea around it that is. Very rarely do we see a film with two characters that start off completely different, but very slowly become all in the same. Dae hoon and Kyung chul are both very stubborn individuals, who will not back down from each other. They just keep at each other, and even as Kyung chul is continually beaten, abused and victimized, he never once lets up. I keep coming back to a comparison with Batman and The Joker in The Dark Knight, and how those two menaces push each other to their physical limits, and that is exactly what happens in this film. While it was easy to pick sides in Dark Knight, Ji woon makes it increasingly difficult for the audience to figure out who they should sympathize with here. It is a haunting and blatantly moral defying story, and its raw and emotional undertones are more than difficult to swallow.But the key problem I found with the film is Ji woon's lack of ability to know when to cut. There are easily twenty minutes that could be chopped right out of the film, and none of its edge would be lost in the process. I was glued to the screen for the majority of the film, but found myself checking my watch more than once because I was totally baffled as to why it runs over  minutes. There is only so much revenge one can take and comprehend, and having the film run so long makes it all too easy to call out as being self indulgent. I respect the film, and I respect Ji woon as a filmmaker (I wanted to seek out the rest of his film catalogue immediately after the lights came up), but it just makes such an incredible movie feel a bit sloppy and weakened as a cohesive package.Another inconsistent element is Lee's Dan hoon. We never learn much about him outside of his being a secret agent and wanting to inflict as much pain as he can through his revenge scheme. So how are we to assume he was not a sick and twisted individual in the first place? How are we to know this is not his first time inflicting such a painful revenge? He rarely speaks, and his cold, calculating eyes never once give us a hint of any further development. It is a great performance by Lee, but it is one that feels very underdeveloped \u2013 outside of some rather obvious sequences.But then, anyone would look underdeveloped when standing next to Choi. The man gives a performance that is the stuff of legend. He was incredible as the lead in Oldboy as the man who was wronged, and is even better as the wrongdoer here. He brings out the monster in Kyung chul all too easily, and his riveting performance is unmissable. The transformation into this disgusting, psychopathic creature is nothing short of amazing. He chews up scenery at every turn, and is magnetic on screen. Nothing even comes close to equaling the power, intensity and dare I say authenticity he puts into this character. He is the stuff of nightmares.I Saw the Devil is a great revenge thriller, but is far from perfect. Choi's electric performance alone should become required viewing for anyone with any interest in film. .(An edited version of this review also appeared on http:  www.geekspeakmagazine.com).", "I Saw The Devil is a bloody masterpiece. Jee woon Kim has proved himself to be a master storyteller. Beautiful shots, a creative script, perfect acting and intense violence make I Saw The Devil a must see movie for anyone who calls themselves a horror fan.It's a breath of fresh air in a seemingly stagnant genre full of the same old vampire and zombie stories being retold over and over. And yes, there have been loads of revenge movies before, but I Saw The Devil takes it to the next level.Gritty, dark, gory and original: I loved this movie, and I don't like anything.

I waited until my eyes were dry again to write down my thoughts on this. First of all before starting to dug into the material I want to thank and curse at the writers at the same time. They've given me a very hard time. I was so stressed out especially at the very ending I think my face was rather covered in sweat than actually tears. But it wasn't a disappointing ending, thank god.This is my first time I've seen anything about the actor Lee Junho and I must admit I have fallen in love him. His performances were beyond great. I felt every single emotion he potrayed and he actually made me forget that this was only a drama. Searched him up right after the first episode and found out he is not only a talented actor but also singer (goals).As for the actress. I was suprised to find out that this was her first lead role in a drama. She did a very good job I believe. Still...and I'm really sorry to say this but I'm just not quite sure of her acting. I believed it was very good in the beginning. Later on it became somehow a little annoying and I'm not sure if this is because of her character or the writers but she seemed dull and emotionless which I seriously can't stand. Even if you have to play emotionless you should show emotion. I mean you should show us something. One more thing that bothered me was her stiffness especially in scenes involving kissing. \nThe first time I didn't notice. As for the second and third time. But at some point I felt like Junho was kissing a corpse. She did not only look really uncomfortable and stiff doing it but she looked more of a corpse. Girl, like move a little, show some emotion. Don't make THAT face. She literally made a face. I was disgusted and this is my first time noticing something like that. I've seen a lot of actresses be a bit stiff during kissing scenes but this was on another level. \nI really liked her in the beginning but toward the end she became annoying. I think that is more of the writers issue though since they're the ones creating her. However it wasn't as terrible as it sounds. I still like her as a character and have seen far worse characters in dramas. I had my issues with the second lead Seo Joo won (Lee Ki woo) was BORING AS HELL. I'm sorry but everything regarding him bored me to death. I started skipping some of his scenes but at some point I even stopped doing that. That's how much he bored me. I also didn't like him. He was unlikable from the very beginning. I'm probably the only one thinking that he was actually really selfish and a coward.Kang Ha na's character Jung Yoo jin was so dull and annoying. I really think I'm the only one that did not like those two characters. They both were so emotionless, boring characters, they deserve each other.I absolutely hated Gang doo's sister. Sooo unlikable. I hated Moon soo's mother and father. Both of them were horrible parents. I couldn't find anything in them that seemed like they were good people. I loved Ma ri (Yoon Se ah). Her character was very interesting. She pretended to be this strong woman whilst being very vulnerable and already broken.\nI liked the actress and loved the character.\nI LOVED SANG MAN. And I'm not saying this because he has a disability, no. He was really a great character. I really like the actor too. \nSame goes to the grandma and suprisingly I liked the director Jung Yoo taek (Tae In ho). He is actually a total a**hole but somehow I felt like he was just raised wrong and deep down he's actually a really interesting character. For some reason I never hated him. He did some ugly things but he still managed to be likable. Plus he was really funny.I actually loved the story. It was really realistic. I felt the pain and struggles of the characters but there were too many unnecessary flashbacks especially showing the same scenes over and over again. At some point it became really stressing though. I felt like we didn't get much romance. Rather, we had a lot of scenes boring people talking about boring constructions and boring contracts. I mean it started to get as if I was watching a documentary. I really hated the fact that the whole show was about that damn memorial and yet we didn't get to see any of it. Less construction site and S Mall crashing flashback scenes and I would be totally happy. But those got really annoying (seriously. were the writers architects???) Still the show managed to grab me, mostly because of Gang doo. His story and character just spoke out to me and I loved that we've seen more about his life than Moon soo's.Acting was generally very good, writing was pretty good, cinematography could have been better but was enough. Overall a must watch for someone who seeks out a good melodrama because this is IT. (I cried my eyes out)I'm removing one star for boring characters and their boring construction site talks.

Everything about this show is overly formulaic, and it's quite clear this show is just going through the motions right from the get go; the litany of stock clich\u00e9s, plot points, predictable characters, circumstances, etc. are as endless as they are unexpected. As a result, there was never a moment during this show where I was truly engaged with the story itself or anyone involved. As a seasoned K drama viewer, this show did not go over very well with me, and I've seen everything it had to offer done much better in many other shows both past & present.This show doesn't waste any time letting you know how weakly written it's going to be. The dialogue is not particularly bad, but the overall storytelling is quite lacking. They couldn't even think of a proper mechanism to have the two main characters be together in the first place; believe it or not, this is it: A photographer takes some after hours pics of the two leads together. These pics go public, but they aren't really scandalous or even newsworthy, and they could easily be explained away as the innocuous photos they actually were. Instead of simply rectifying the situation, the two leads reason that it would be better to pretend they are dating to avoid a scandal. This subsequently leads to them both agreeing to pretend to be married to further the fa\u00e7ade they've created. The prime minister somehow thinks all of this will help protect and advance his political career, and the reporter girl somehow thinks this is an acceptable way to make her father happy before he dies. Unfortunately, none of this makes any sense whatsoever. I've seen a lot of tenuous motives for two people to be together in K dramas over the years, but this is quite possibly the dumbest one ever; there is no logical reason or benefit for the prime minister to agree to any of this, and the reporter girl's father can hardly even remember who his daughter is (much less determine if she's married or not) thanks to his severe and highly selective bout of Alzheimer's (i.e. he conveniently gets worse or better according to what's useful to the plot at any given time).You're introduced to the secondary cast as the story unfolds; they are the standard jumble of anticipated characters (the annoying kids, the annoying housekeeper, the annoying alternative love interests, the annoying uncle step brother antagonist, etc). Every one of these roles is written as a tired stereotype that's devoid of any range or depth. As a result, I did not care about any of these characters, what their motives or personal problems were, or how their story arcs were progressed & resolved. They were nothing more than mere nuisances and contrivances throughout the story, and were so bland and one dimensional that I couldn't be concerned enough to like or hate any of them.Lethargic storytelling manifests itself throughout this entire show. This is never more evident wherever the secondary love interests are concerned; these  are attracted to the  leads, but their reasons for liking them are never fleshed out in any meaningful or convincing manner. It's as if the writers simply said Here's the designated secondary love interests antagonists because it's mandatory we include them. There is very little romance or comedy to be had in this show either, and both of these aspects rarely hit acceptable marks; what passes for comedy (and often romance for that matter) basically consists of the two leads accidentally falling into each other's arms again and again while trying to avoid some faintly awkward misunderstandings. There are a few early dream sequences that actually had some comedic promise, but this is never fully capitalized on. Ultimately, neither the comedy nor the romance works very well during this show, and the romance angle isn't helped any by the dubious pairing of the two main leads to begin with.Lee Bum Soo plays the prime minister, and Im Yoo Na portrays the reporter girl. He's a veteran of Korean films whose been popping up in KTV dramas more recently, and she's a K Pop star turned actress that's about  years his junior. Needless to say, they aren't really well suited to act opposite each other in a show like this in the first place, and, this does manifest itself on screen...they each do OK by themselves, but the required chemistry between them never quite materializes to help benefit this show.Summary: While not outright terrible, this show simply doesn't work very well as a whole. It lacks too many of the necessary ingredients to be a compelling watch. It's neither romantic enough, intelligent enough, amusing enough, creative enough, or dramatic enough, and, thus not memorable enough. There are some occasional worthwhile & or endearing moments here and there, but not nearly enough to recommend.Bottom Line:  out of  stars.", "This drama is just okay. It actually reminds me of the american sitcom The Nanny. There was a nice home y feeling that this drama projected, which was the highlight of the drama, along with the cameo of Exo's leader, Suho.

You can't say this about an awful lot of series, especially not ones within the horror genre. In that regard the series deserves lots of credit but at the same time it also isn't exactly a movie series that stands out with great movies in it. All of them are quite average but certainly original and watchable enough to check out. Also as standalone movies, fore the series its movies aren't really connected to each other story  or character wise.It perhaps isn't fair to call this movie an horror, since it actually focuses far more on the mystery and dramatic elements of the story. This has basically been the case with every movie out of its series but yet they keep on advertising it as Asian horror because that simply is the popular thing to do. It would also be hard to advertise it in any other way really and find the right target audience for this movie. It's a hard sell because all of these movies are basically such unique and original ones within its genre. That's why I always keep enjoying these movies and wouldn't mind seeing more of them being made in the near future. As of yet this remains the last one out of the series but there is no reason to stop here really. There is still plenty of ground to explore and new, different, approaches to take on its concept.But having said this; I don't regard Yeo go goi dam    Dong ban ja sal as an all too solid movie. Out of all the movies this one has probably the most simple script, even though toward the end the movie becomes overly complicated again. It might be because the movie is 'borrowing' too much from its previous movies. The characters are all the same again, even though its a fresh new story with new characters and actors in it and also the way the movie progresses is quite predictable, especially when you've already seen some of the previous movies out of the series. The movie reminded me a bit too much of the first and the third movie; Yeogo goedam and Yeogo goedam : Yeowoo gyedan, which does perhaps makes this a bit of a redundant entry within its series, that doesn't add enough new things.The movie is still good though. It has a pleasant buildup, which is slow but steadily and with every minute starts to show more and more of what is going exactly. In that regard this movie works far better as a mystery than an horror really, even though the movie still has plenty of scares and also bloody moments in it.Thing that didn't worked as well were its actors. Out of all the movies within its series this one probably featured the worst actors in it. Or perhaps it was the directing, since every movie out of the series had featured young, inexperienced actors in it, of which some had never acted before and also never again.It's still a steady movie, that also helps to keep the series a steady one. http:  bobafett.blogspot.com ", "Series of American films, with special emphasis on those concerning the horror genre, are usually known by their apparent tendency to repetition and rapidly exhausting the originality sometimes achieved in the first film. The series Whispering Corridors is however the opposite of this American tendency, being apparently able in five films and ten years after to keep a simple premise and combining differently terror adjacent to ghost stories.Contrary to some of the previous films in the series, A Blood Pledge clearly proposes itself explicitly as an horror movie, investing in concrete elements supposed to scare the viewer, and limiting in an obvious way the investment in the history plot. The film follows the possibly least interesting and most generic of the arguments registered in the series, although being the first that considers the topic of group suicide among students in Korea. The characters are particularly uninteresting (especially the main protagonist and the ghost), with ineffective and exaggerated acting being often registered. The explanation of the events is done in a slow pace, with no particular final twist (as commonly observed in the current panorama of classic Asian cinema). A Blood Pledge stands out as the first film repeating obvious elements previously used in the series, recurring to a few acceptably well done scares under the clear influence of Ringu. A wide range (not guaranteeing its effectiveness) of special effects is also used, usually with an unreasonable exaggeration of blood and a few laughable moments of attempt of terror (special emphasis on an exploding head...). All in all, A Blood Pledge still provides a good entertainment, but is merely a simplistic horror movie devoid of anything even considered remotely interesting.Original review : http:  asian cineblog.blogspot.fr   a blood pledge.html", "If this movie teaches you nothing else, you will walk away saying there are some shady females out there. If you've seen all the other films, you will be happy to learn that this one is just as good as the rest. This and the th film are best in my opinion. Check it out. Great addition in the series.", "The Blood Pledge is the fifth film of the South Korean horror series Whispering Corridors, where the only thing in common threading through all the films, are its predominantly female cast, its setting in an all girls high school, the dabbling with ghouls and spirits, and the context of urban myths and legends being spread through the gossip sessions along the corridors of schools, from which the anthology got its title from. All stories so far are different, and so are the characters, so in truth, you can watch this as a standalone film.But it's not so much of a horror film, than a study into the psyche of the female of the species. Can I understand it? Certainly, as far as identifying common and distinctive behavioral patterns go. I would call this film, and probably the series, a girly girl's film, not because of its cast, but rather having plenty of girly moments that before you label me sexist, think about it   girls will probably understand just what this is all about from its premise to the character motivations, while the guys, I suppose we're probably happy with the eye candy on display, rather than to sweat about the stuff that we don't understand because we're wired differently.Take for instance, we don't fathom why the girls behave the way they do, with friendship treated so frivolously, in one moment you can befriend someone, and because of cliques and the want to belong to another group, you've got to burn bridges with others just so as to demonstrate group loyalty. Then there's the usual petty fights and arguments about grades, the stealing of boyfriends, gee wheez! the whole nine yards of schoolyard problems, magnified because you've got arguing school girls trying to assert their influence on one another. Here, there are  of them making up the core group, and a lot more from the outside playing supporting characters, which in turn makes it a pretty noisy, active school with the students doing everything but study.The tale begins with  students   Soy (Son Eun seo), Eon ju (Jang Kyeong ah), Eugene (Oh Yeon seo, don't ask why the masculine character name) and Eun yeong (Song Min jeong) making a pact to commit suicides together. Well, if there's the existence of suicide clubs, then this idea and premise isn't all that far fetched, though their motivations to do so are kept under wraps for the time being. Meeting at a chapel and making the titular blood pledge where they are to die together, things get messy when only Eon ju ended up killing herself, which leads to the rest being spooked because they fail to keep their end of the bargain. Witnessed by Eon Ju's youngest sister Jeong eon (Yu Shin ae), she begins to bug the rest into providing answers, which of course isn't forthcoming, in order to provide narrative legs for the film.Now just how one can form such a pact is beyond me, and so are things like running to your BFF and telling her everything, and I mean everything, about the problems one is facing. Perhaps it's a guy thing to put up a strong front and not break down uncontrollably while figuring out solutions to problems, but in this case it is this confiding that perhaps laid the foundation for being continuously spooked. That said, this is not a horror film per se, as the ghoul hear appears in the day and at night, being much more like a guardian angel to keep her BFF away from trouble, and to inflict pain upon those that have ill intention toward a BFF. I suppose such a friend is for keeps, since he she ensures some level of protection even when belonging to another realm altogether.Writer director Lee Jong yong follows the tried and tested formula in Asian horror narrative, always giving out a little clue at a time as the story progresses, while dealing with the background of each of the characters, whether or not they contribute to the story directly. The scares here are pretty expected, with heavy reliance on sudden movements, in your face appearances, and dastardly makeup in other to elicit the fear factor, but seasoned genre audiences won't find your hair standing at all, being rather intrigued by the female talent on display here. After all, this franchise is famed for having some of its alumni progress into blockbusters and award winning films, with the likes of Song Ji hyo from Wishing Stairs making that starring role as the Queen in A Frozen Flower, and more recently, Kim OK bin from Voice making her big art house break as the bullied wife turned vampire in Thirst. It's anyone's guess now who amongst the ensemble here will progress much faster than the rest.", "Friendship, love and jealousy are the three themes that thrive in this particular horror film, although don't let that fool you into thinking that lesbianism has anything to do with the plot, as it has previously. Familial love, love between two best friends, and love of academia and succeeding are frequently prominent. Set in an all girl's school (like the former titles), the film focuses upon Jeong eon (Shin ae Yu), who waits for her sister Eon ju (Kyeong ah Jang) outside of a building one night, only to have her tragically commit suicide by throwing herself from the roof of the same building.But was it really suicide? The mystery behind this event is the driving force that keeps the viewer entertained in this incredibly complex story that is slowly revealed overtime in the form of flashbacks. The audience continuously remains uncertain of what led to the tragic circumstance, the way the truth is hidden been one of the strongest aspects of the feature.Unlike the previous Whispering Corridors films, where we already have preconceptions regarding the deceased student from having previously witnessed her, in this feature, the first time we see Eon ju is during the final seconds leading up to her demise. From the beginning, viewers are made aware Eon ju's death is related to a suicide pact three best friends, So Hee (Eun seo Son), Yoo jin (Yeon su Oh) and Eun yeong (Min jeong Song) form, swearing that whoever does not partake in the ritual will inevitably be haunted by those who took their lives. Eon Ju's return as a ghost, haunting these young ladies, immediately makes it clear that she was somehow involved, and Jeong eon is equally suspicious, continuously pressing So Hee, Eon ju's best friend, for answers. The secrecy between these three friends after Eon ju's suicide leads the school body to conceive slanderous rumors about what may have happened.Despite the friendship between So Hee, Yoo jin and Eun yeong been fleshed out, the connection between sisters Jeong eon and Eon ju is not, and for the most part they seem like total strangers. Despite Jeong eon's dedication to uncovering the truth, she sometimes appears less emotionally traumatized than one may imagine, while it is So Hee who seems to bear a number of emotional scars, making their friendship appear more legitimate.One of the biggest flaws in A Blood Pledge is its repetitive nature. Often, the film depicts the three friends communing together, then shows one of them been attacked verbally by students who blame them for Eon ju's death, before revealing a scene where Jeon eon confronts So Hee, this series of events happening more than once over the course of the film, although occasionally the order is arranged in an alternative format. Besides this, there are a couple of decent jump scares that take place over the course of the plot, but at the same time, more than one of them has been previously encountered in former Whispering Corridors films, causing them to feel predictably stale.For the most part. A Blood Pledge plays out similarly to a revenge story, where the ghost of the deceased returns to wreck havoc upon those who wronged them. At the same time, there is one particular occurrence that transpires during the friendship between Eun ju and So Hee (you'll recognize it when you encounter it readers!) that is largely unexplained, the impact of which is quite mountainous when it comes to some of their later decisions. Although at times beautiful, the lackluster degree of information provided in this circumstance prohibits the audience from becoming further involved.Furthermore, the motivations behind a number of the deaths that transpire over the course of the feature are seldom provided sufficient detail on why it is they died. Though by the end we are able to make assumptions behind why these potentially occurred, it may have been beneficial to have a more detailed explanation. Moreover, the relationship between So Hee and boyfriend Ki Ho may have also benefited from additional material, and Ki Ho's mother, who later becomes involved, deserved additional screen time too.By the end, when the truth is finally revealed, though the sadness exhibited during this scene is incredibly powerful, it is not enough to adequately benefit the entirety of the film as a whole. If not for the repetitiveness, and if greater focus was emphasized on characters who, in contrast with the three friends, were largely overshadowed, the plot's depth would have been greatly strengthened. Where former Whispering Corridors films employed scenarios and ideas that caused them to feel uniquely fresh and entertaining, A Blood Pledge sacrifices originality for overused and sometimes clich\u00e9 scenes and ideas that could inevitably be described as 'safe'. For a franchise that has made a habit of pushing the boundaries of horror, safety is the one element Whispering Corridors does not require."], "Sentiment Score": 0.93}, "400": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1049": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["Pasta is a  episode Korean TV Drama that aired in .SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: Yoo Kyung is a lowly kitchen assistant working at an upscale Italian restaurant. She works hard and dreams of becoming a top chef one day, but her life is soon turned upside down when an abrasive new head chef takes over the restaurant she works at and promptly makes everyone's lives miserable. The new chef (Hyun Wook) is a skilled yet demanding boss, and he's also a smug misogynistic prick who belittles everyone he comes across. Inexplicably, Yoo Kyung and Hyun Wook start to develop feelings for each other and soon begin a cautious relationship.From there, it's standard K Drama fare that employs the mismatched budding romantic leads plot, along with two alternative love interests with their own back stories, and a host of side characters along the way. Just follow along with everyone's personal & professional lives to see where it all goes. It's the same pattern as always, only this show takes place in a kitchen restaurant environment (instead of a hotel, hospital, etc.). PROSIt's Predictability: There is something to be said for how comfortably familiar these shows often are. It's like wearing your favorite old jeans or sweatshirt, or, perhaps a better analogy would be eating your favorite comfort food; If you're a regular viewer of these types of shows, you know exactly how this particular show is going to feel & taste right from the get go.Lead Actress: Gong Hyo Jin plays Yoo Kyung; she's become one of the go to actresses for these types of shows in recent years, and she's really good in general at playing the girl just trying to get by in life who stumbles into a romance. However, this is not one of my favorite roles for her.The Food: DO NOT watch this show on an empty stomach!...There aren't many shows that consistently presents food on screen so exquisitely as this one does; we're talking hard core food porn here as this show often focuses on the kitchen chefs creating and producing one fantastic looking dish after another. It's mostly Italian cuisine, with some Korean flair mixed in, along with lobster, filet mignon, fine dining meals, entrees, various presentations, and so forth. And, of course, lots and lots of pasta. Everything looks absolutely delicious!Soundtrack: Nobody does TV show soundtracks & musical scores like KTV does, and I think this is one of the most regularly undervalued aspects of all of these shows. As usual, there are a half dozen recurring melodies or so that are utilized to suit the varying moods as needed throughout this show, plus (if I remember correctly) a couple of a KPop stars on hand to sing a duet or two as per norm. This is not my favorite OST by any means, but I don't know how many times I've watched these shows and thought that's a catchy & appropriate tune, that's a nice song, etc.Pacing: This show does keep everything moving along. There is some repetitiveness to it, but very little of the endless pauses and longing stares of people reminiscing about stuff that just happened. I have very little tolerance for that nonsense in my K Dramas.Ending: It's (SPOILERS) no surprise that everybody lives happily ever after in some fashion or another by the time it all wraps up. CONSIt's Predictability: Yes, this is listed as one of the Pros, but this cuts both ways. If you're hoping for anything out of the ordinary or unexpected to happen here, you can forget it. There is little doubt what will eventually happen to all the players involved by the middle of episode . It wouldn't hurt for a few more of these shows to try to be a little more diverse every now and then.Endless Over Acting: The main characters don't have to endure this too much, but almost all of the auxiliary characters are forced to over act to the point of buffoonery at times. Sometimes this is cute & effective, but it's simply annoying and obnoxious way more often than not.Lead Actor's character: This is by far the biggest problem with this show! The lead male chef character is played by Lee Sun Gyun. He represents the stern teacher figure type that supposed to grow and soften over time as the main love interest, but his evolution is so poorly executed that he rarely ever becomes even an acceptable person (much less a love interest character to root for). What woman in their right mind would want to be with this guy?...He's arrogant, stubborn, childish, condescending, verbally abusive, and offers little in the way of being a desirable mate. And, the stupid smirk he's always wearing on his face doesn't help matters any. By extension, the mere fact that Yoo Kyung actually likes this guy reflects very poorly on her character.Summary: It has its moments, and is by no means terrible, but the Cons often outweigh the Pros IMO. And, it's severely hampered by its choice to write the male lead character as they did; this guy is just way too much of a jerk for the viewer to identify with why the female lead character would ever like him in the first place. If this were real life, these  people would clearly be headed for a depressing relationship, or divorce, or worse, if they decided to be together long term. It would be one thing if this show were aiming for that type of future dismal outlook, but it's not; this is all somehow supposed to be romantic, and you're supposed to be persuaded that the male lead is just perfect for our female lead, and that everything will work out great between them in the end. I, however, think this show fails miserably at trying to accomplish that.Bottom Line:  out of  stars!", "Pasta is the first Korean drama I saw in Netflix (Hulu also offers a lot of Asian shows) attracted for the theme focusing in a restaurant and food. I enjoyed this show because I like learning about different cultures and after watching the first episode I was totally captured for the plot and the high quality of this production.Pasta is about a girl who wants to become a chef of an Italian restaurant in South Korea. At this point I should say that Korean dramas are very close related to Mexican soap operas but also have a lot of Manga elements. There is always a love story (many times a love triangle), a lot of comedy and, of course, a lot of drama. Pasta in particular has a lot of fun and you learn some cooking too. So far I have watched three Korean dramas and I noticed that they usually have between  to  episodes of one hour each. The only thing that could bother a little bit about Korean dramas to Americans is the way women are portrayed kind of passive, but seeing this behavior in the three shows I guess is part of the culture over there.

She wakes up in the year , in the body of  year old Hae Soo and there, she encounters the many royal princes of the ruling family. She initially falls in love with the gentle and warm th Prince Wang Wook (Kang Ha Neul), and later with Wang So (Lee Joon Gi), the mutilated th Prince who hides his scarred face behind a mask. He's surnamed wolf dog, because he had to fight wolves when he was still young and was treated badly as a hostage. Now he likes to foster his image as a fearsome beast. There's a fight for the throne going on. Hae Soo finds herself caught between it all. Thanks to her history lessons at school she comes to realize Wang So will win this battle finally. He'll become the future king of Goryeo, and a bloody tyrant at that. Soo loves So, but she also fears him. Can she change her lover into a better ruler in time? The Good: The first meeting of the 'Moon Lovers', Hae Soo and Wang So, sets the tone for the whole series: old fashioned romance but a love that hurts. There's the black Wolf Prince riding his war horse, first endangering Hae Soo but saving her as well by lifting her in the saddle in front of him. Then there's the extended closeup of their faces, sitting opposite each other, bouncing up and down, having their eyes on each other while the music plays their love theme. The next scene he seems afraid of his own feelings and So drops Soo to the ground. Their love is painful, literally.Leading man Lee Joon Gi is simply the best actor available for that kind of TV making. The minute he appears on the screen I am glued to his face and facial expressions despite his mask, that renders all kinds of emotions like joy, pain, embarrassment, hate. Notwithstanding his well performed fighting scenes, he's in danger of becoming a modern Rudolph Valentino, with female fans only. I hope he'll get the chance to proof himself in less romantic roles playing more tormented characters like the lead in Man on High Heels ()for example.The Bad: Moon Lovers is a remake of the Chinese series 'Scarlet Heart' with  episodes. The original version could handle all the princes and their love interests. The Korean production however should have cut some story lines to flesh out the characters of Soo and So, who are the protagonists, giving them more time to develop their romance. Now we were misled thinking Wang Wook was Soo's Prince Charming. Kang Ha Neul gives a stunning performance, so it was no punishment to watch him stealing screen time from Lee Joon Gi. But the story lines became too difficult to tell, leaving plot holes until the very end. Also there are still questions unanswered: is this all about(moon)love? Or altering history? Who knows?Nevertheless I would highly recommend this series. I was hooked for  episodes, hoping for a sequel.", "I am no fan of Korean TV series but I took an exception in watching since the plot was very complicated taking a step back in time. It took me awhile to feel comfortable watching since it took a lot of effort in reading subtitles while internalizing the dialogue. But right after Episode , I was totally hooked. I couldn't stop with just  episode a night and had the craving to just watch all  episodes in  nights!! Scarlet Heart Ryeo has just begun airing in the Philippines but I have access to the original version with English subtitle, which I prefer. It was giving me a headache listening to the Tagalog translation. Besides, it was more heart wrenching hearing their original voices. So, as a fan of the Scarlet Heart Ryeo series, I hope that a Scarlet Heart Ryeo  is up for an international showing SOON. It may not have been a hit in South Korea but I hope that the producers seek the comments from the international audience for an unbiased feedback.", "Moon Lovers was my first Korean Drama, and i got addicted! It is simply SUPERB!!! The actors have a great chemistry together,and i will like to find out other movies or settings they had made before Moon Lovers! The landscapes and locations are fantastic,the battle scenes were like watching a well made action movie with great battle choreography. I was surprised from the costumes and fashion of the era that were Amazing,and most of all the plot is breathtaking! I can't hide that I cried many times over the  episodes i saw in just  days time! I recommend it to everyone,and i hope that there will be a second season!!!

There are some really sad events earlier in the drama, but last part is just tragic. Usually, when a drama ends like that, it makes me hate the whole story.

Goblin,also known as Dokkaebi, is a drama with the main themes of fantasy,romance and melodrama with a tinge of action and comedy. It is about a Goblin called Kim Shin and a nameless Grim Reaper who are connected to each other by their past without them knowing at the start. Other main characters include Ji Eun Tak who is the Goblin's bride, Yu Deok Hwa, and Sunny who is the Grim Reaper's love interest.Despite some parts being lengthy and bland, it was needed as the viewers have to know the background story between the main characters in their past lives. The story is a beautiful and heartwarming one where sacrifices have to be made like how Eun Tak must pull out the sword in Kim Shin's chest in order to save herself but kill Kim Shin in the process. In the end, it was Kim Shin who forced Eun Tak to pull out the sword due to a dangerous situation(See Ep ) and as a result, he managed to save Eun Tak by sacrificing himself.Besides the main story, there is also the story between the Grim Reaper and Sunny and the interaction between the two of them is often amusing and funny. The bromance between the Grim Reaper and Goblin is also worth noting as it highlights the impressive chemistry between the two.Bottom line: Goblin is a must watch for all Kdrama starters as it has all the ingredients for a good drama.

It's a romantic fantasy themed melodrama that has become very popular in this medium over the last decade or so.This show pulled huge ratings and was a smashing success for its creators. It follows a virtual can't miss formula for this genre (i.e. good looking actors & actresses in a star crossed love story). The writers of this show certainly know their target audience, and, they delivered exactly what was expected. If you're not part of the target audience however (i.e. guys, people above a certain age, or those that are simply looking for a superbly woven story), this show might not be suited for you.There's a heavy emphasis on catering to fan girls throughout this series. This show is basically geared towards young women and it provides a very non threatening view of relationships accordingly. There's nothing wrong with this, but, I think anyone expecting otherwise should be aware of this from the outset. The female lead basically serves as a proxy for viewers to identify with; she lives the lavish fantasy life style complete with various trials and tribulations to overcome. Meanwhile, there are  handsome rich guys for her to choose from; one is the aforementioned alien & main love interest, the other is her childhood friend that dotes on her endlessly. In an indication of how safe this show is for young female viewers, the alien love interest is still a virgin and can't even kiss a woman without fainting. He can't handle alcohol either, but he does happen to have chivalrous values, super powers to protect our heroine, and a rockin' set of abs.The childhood friend represents Plan B for our heroine if things don't work out with the alien. He's walking a very fine line between nice guy that will always be there for her vs. obsessive stalker that won't leave her alone. This guy's older brother portrays the villain from central casting; he's good looking too, but in a fashionably evil way. He plays your typical Chaebol heir lunatic that must control everything while eliminating everybody that gets in the way, and, this show goes to great lengths to let you know he's the bad guy every time he appears on screen; he's involved in a number of murder mystery sub plots that soon finds him facing off against our two leads.Jun Ji Hyun (Gianna Jun) and Kim Soo Hyun are your two leads; she's the eccentric and conceited top Korean actress, he's the noble alien from Planet Korean Hunky Dude. Gianna Jun is a hugely successful Korean film star, but her presence and style of acting does seem somewhat ill suited for the small screen; she's a movie star that should be starring in movies, not playing stock KTV damsel in distress roles. Kim Soo Hyun is a star in the making, and seems to be a capable enough actor; he's given a predictable K drama male part as the stoic white knight. As such, he's allowed few opportunities to show much range that are afforded these types of roles. The two of them have worked together previously, and they complement each other nicely here. There's a bunch of supporting actors and actresses involved; some current and up and coming talent, along with several K drama veterans that all did what was asked, but several of these parts were under written and or non essential. Acting, overall, was solid throughout.As expected, production values are quite good, and this show comes complete with loads of stylishly beautiful people. Cohesive storytelling is sometimes lacking however; it's clear the writers were just making things up as they went along (which is not really all that uncommon for these shows), but they really pushed the limits on occasion here, and I found this to be quite irritating. The rules governing what will happen to the alien and what he can can't do are ever changing; his powers come and go when convenient to the plot, he's apparently not allowed to kill humans or he'll die too (yet he somehow managed to serve  years in the military throughout various wars without killing anyone), etc... Random side characters come and go too, without ever being appropriately developed within the overall story; the estranged father shows up just in time to donate blood to save his daughter, then he just disappears again for a while, and, I question the need to tie any of this story into the alien's first encounter with an earth girl. I know they were aiming for a fate destiny angle here, but that girl in the past really has nothing to do with the woman in the present other than looking similar to her. It's this kind of writing that is really annoying to me, and I see no reason why the writers couldn't still appease their target audience while tightening up the story some. And, while I see many people liked the ending, I can't help but point out that it practically negates the importance of everything that occurred prior to it.Summary: This will be well received by the crowd it's aimed at. It's not blatantly immature and has enough decent moments for viewers outside of the in crowd to enjoy...I found the little st person vignettes throughout the show to be a particularly nice touch. Still, it should have been way better than what it was, and, it could have had the best of both worlds if the producers writers were willing & able to try a little harder to appeal to a wider audience.Bottom Line: For the right audience, it's   out of  stars. For not the right audience, it's closer to   out of  stars. Split decision leaves it at  stars IMO.", "The cutest, craziest, saddest, sweetest Korean drama I've ever seen  although there were handfuls of bitter moments they just made it more thrilling& sweeter. When I first intended to watch this TV drama of my favorite actress Jun Ji Hyun (as I watched and reviewed all her movies and enjoyed a bunch of cute ads also) and went through news of its insane popularity in China, I hardly imagined that a nerd (yet sentimental & melodrama lover) like me would fantasize and even dream about this fantasy drama throughout the whole show. But as the alien hero professor Do Min Joon ( Kim Soo Hyun) cast his magical spell of mind  blowing coolness (that humble& caring personality really suits him much!), heroine Cheon Song Yi (Jun Ji Hyun)'s cute craziness brought about enjoyable funny moments (even excessive make ups for lead actress role can't hide her adorable sassy identity) ,cool soundtracks pleased my ears and after all Korean director, script writer and all the staffs showed expertness in playing with audience's emotions wonderfully as usual so at last it seemed to me  that I loved to be deceived and obsessed in tranquility of fantasy wholeheartedly was destined to happen! Do Min Joon & Cheon Song Yi  I really loved chemistry of this couple a lot. ^_^", "This drama portrays romantic comedy in a new light. It is more than a romance between an alien and a human but is a mystery crime show as well. As you watch to determine how the romance will play out, you are also intrigued by why the obviously socio pathic character is killing people and whether or not he will be caught.The characters are realistic and funny, while not being campy and the outside scenery is beautiful whether reliving  years in the past or modern Seoul.The drama is an analogy of trust. Each character has to learn to trust and be trusted. Also, to learn that there are those who no matter how much you love them can not be trusted.From beginning to end, it is well worth watching.

He knows he is not abandoned, and that he has to wait for a long time to return to his home. He is a fast learner, and has superhuman abilities, as per the earthlings' standards. So meanwhile, he reads a lot of books and learns a lot many skills  those required for survival and some as a hobby. He can teleport within a particular distance, can stop time for about a minute, can mind control nonliving things, has great hearing capabilities, and many more traits. But he understands through time and experience that showcasing his abilities does him and the people around him no good. So he starts living incognito, under different identities.The actual story starts  years later, in modern day Seoul. He's presently known as Do Min Joon, a Harvard alumnus, and a professor. Dilemma and confusion starts when he notices the same girl that he once saved, or perhaps someone bearing an exact resemblance to her, after so many years. Is this actress a rebirth, or reincarnation? Is it a totally different person? He enters her life, curiosity getting better of him. Again assuming the role of her protector, ally and savior, he eventually falls for her, way before she realizes her own feelings.Spice to the story is added by the murder mystery that happens to occur in between, involving conspiring millionaires, detectives, and the protagonists' lives; the romantic comedy, the humor and crazy tactics of the leads; and the play of emotions. What happens to their story, when he has to leave earth in a month? Does he really have no attachments? And what happens when his true nature is revealed? Does he finally return to his universe leaving everyone behind? The  episodes is an enjoyable roller coaster ride through the story.There is not a single boring moment in the sitcom. There's thrill in every episode, fun and laugh out loud scenes too.PS: This is not your ET or 'Koi Mil Gaya'. And aliens here are not ugly and grotesque. They are fairer and more beautiful than normal human being, with a very high lifespan. They are not immortals, nor are they vampires. Vampires don't teleport, remember?

The driver who hit the car, actually aimed at killing both father and child, however the main actress was present and even though she was intimidated into not going to court to testify whether the accident was no accident, she did go.

There are however some annoyances I have had while watching this show.Plot:\nThe show felt directionless, with no clear plan or goal. Characters were bouncing from one idea to the next to defeat Gwi almost every episode which some might argue was intentional but it certainly left me feeling as if the script was written on the day of shooting.<  Spoiler> The show suffered several plot holes, the largest of which occured near the end of the series, with the Sung Yoel, the Scholar, deciding not to kill Gwi with seemingly no reason other than to drag the show to  episodes long. This could reflect a lack of planning of events in the writing process. <Spoiler  >The lack of story progression is also an issue especially poignant in the first  episodes, whereby the trope of Sung Yoel saving Yang Sun and giving her blood is repeated  times or more. Rather than a build up to the climax, the story spends its first few episodes following Sung Yoel to and fro his residence saving Yang Sun from danger at the very last moment time and time again.Although quite uninteresting, it is not lost on me that the introductory episodes helped to establish a level of intimacy and romance between Yang Sun and Sung Yoel, which compels the viewer to sympathise with Sung Yoel's background and identity and his sacrifice. The role reversal between Yang Sun and Sung Yoel in the later episodes (whereby it is Yang Sun who constantly finds herself bringing the injured Sung Yoel back to his residence and even offering him her blood) is somewhat touching and commendable from a literary standpoint. Furthermore, by drawing a parallel between Sung Yoel's dead lover and his current one, the film highlights the conflict between man and beast internally and this too is also compelling.Finally, aside from the relationship of the main protagonist, no other felt moving or even genuine. Case in point, the relationship between the Queen and the Crown Prince was set up as an arranged marriage and the Queen was given no prior characterisation aside from her hatred towards her Father. Yet, the script attempts to convince the audience that their relationship was something more. There was a sense that the script tried to do too much with too little (time) which left me feeling that most other romances in the script were very paper thin. ( )Scoring Background music: The scoring was good, which to me meant it served its purpose in conveying the characters' emotions, but not really something I would put in a playlist and listen to on a regular basis. Music was played at fitting and appropriate times with lyrics matching events happening. Fade outs of the music could have been timed with the start of a new scene to make it more appealing. ( )Lines and line delivery: Acting was great. However, actors seemed to be constrained by a weak script. A decent chunk of the script seemed to be information relay, which is not really needed and can take place off screen, giving more screen time to character development. Exposition could have been replaced with actual scenes non verbally providing information to the audience. Rather the script chooses to tell, not show.Another pet peeve I had with the script was the fact that the characters often stated the obvious, as if intentionally dumbing down the dialogue because the writer could not trust the audience enough to be a little more discrete. Also infuriating was the number of times a character asks Is that true? immediately after being told of a fact or right after a major revelation.A sort of meta reflective dialogue towards the last part of the show whereby Yang Sun uses the Night Scholar novels to refer to the show as a whole is refreshing. ( )Special effects and choreography: Fight choreography did not fall into the common one at a time pitfall which plague many good movies, whereby the hero or protagonist, badly outnumbered, is able to take on a group of enemies because they approach him one at a time. Special effects were modern and realistic, keeping the audience immersed in the fictional world.

Possibly the strongest vampire in all the land, the quest to get rid of him is tough and seemingly impossible.

He commissions her help in locating something and they develop a good friendship, which eventually leads to romance.The chemistry between the two leads started out great, but turned stale towards the end as far as the lead actress went.

The story follows  main characters; two show Producing Directors (PD's) in their mid thirties, a younger PD intern, and a young singer idol, that all work in the Korean entertainment industry in some capacity. The show follows the personal & professional lives of these people, and those people around them, while mixing comedy, romance, and drama amongst them.'The Producers' starts off a little unevenly but everything settles in quickly enough, and this show really takes off during episodes  however, it is important to mention that this show also changed directors around this time (in what has to be one of the most ironic cases of life imitating art I've ever seen). There is a change in tone that comes with the change of directors, but it's not unusual for K dramas to have tonal shifts like this anyway. I rather liked the basic groundwork the first director implemented, but I really enjoyed where the second director took the story once the baton was passed.The main cast is great. The  older PD's are played by actor Cha Tae Hyun and actress Gong Hyo Jin. The young PD intern is played by actor Kim Soo Hyun, and the idol singer is played by idol singer IU. If you don't recognize all  of these people, you're not paying nearly enough attention to the Korean entertainment industry as you should be. Tae Hyun & Hyo Jin are both highly experienced and seemingly so at ease with any role they are tasked with; as expected, they each do very good work here, both separately and together, and they play off one other extremely well. As for the younger stars; all the Korean girls know who Soo Hyun is by now, and every Korean under the age of  knows who IU is at this point. I particularly enjoyed watching these two play mostly against type; he as the shy & awkward guy, and she as the alter ego version of her own public persona.Supporting cast is rock solid, as is the story, writing, direction, production values, and just about everything else going on with this show. The soundtrack is terrific and very well implemented, and the endless amount of guest stars, cameos, name dropping, career stories, inside jokes, and so forth, is nothing short of spectacular. The camera angles can be a bit off putting at times due to the purposeful intent to portray a typical K drama as some sort of reality show about people working on reality showsit's often reminiscent to how the British American show 'The Office' was shot in this aspect.The last K drama I can think of that was similarly hyped as 'The Producer' was 'You Who Came From The Stars', and ironically, both shows feature Kim Soo Hyun in a leading role. Both shows share a common quality aside from that actor though, and that is they are each somewhat polarizing Love It or Hate It type shows. I wasn't particularly a fan of 'You Who Came From The Stars', though I didn't outright hate it nor did I give it a scathing review. I've heard and read a lot of comments from many viewers who loved 'YWCFTS' (and similar type shows) however, that just do not like 'The Producers' at all; they find 'The Producers' boring, not melodramatic enough, don't like how Soo Hyun's character is portrayed, etcthey don't think 'The Producers' is as good as everyone thinks it is. But, these people are wrong, because 'The Producers' is goodreally good.This show seems not to care which direction the audience wants the show to go in...it's going to tell its story the way they want. Of course, if the ratings would have stunk, that wouldn't have been the case. I like this approach A LOT and I'd like to see it done more often. It pleases me greatly that this show was well received by many viewersnot just because I liked it and want others to agree, but because Korean TV desperately needs dramas like this to be successful. I've always felt that more diversity was in order within the K drama world, and this show is quite different from the norm in so many ways. It still retains a K drama feel and format, but I think this could be a pivotal show in helping change the industry for the better. Not every K drama show needs to be (virtually) the same story over and over again in order to be accepted, and KTV land might find an audience they never even knew existed if they continue to try taking a more intelligent and adult approach to some of these shows. As for those of you who didn't like the show for the reasons mentioned in the previous paragraphGet over it!...There are hundreds of shows that fit your preferred criteria both past & present, and I can assure you that's not going to change (nor should it) anytime soon.Summary: Personally, I loved it!...There's no question it's quite well done overall, and it is jammed packed full of extra goodies for long time fans of the Korean entertainment industry. And, if you happen to like both Korean variety reality shows & K dramas, it's a real treat. It might not work all that well for the younger generation or those expecting a traditional K drama format; it is often dialogue heavy, story driven, and very light on the flashiness and epic love story melodrama.

The main story is the struggles of a rookie PD who works on a sinking variety show. Now, the romance was so so, but, thankfully, it developed the way I wanted it to develop ( I can't describe it better as I'll give away too many spoilers). Anyway, the chemistry between the rookie PD and his senior wasn't that good in order for the drama to have a strong romantic vibe. But I did loved the female leads performance, even though the rookie PD was a little awkward and I would have liked for him to have done a better job if possible. IU was okay, but I haven't watched her yet on other dramas so I don't know if she can do better. Another thing that bothered me was the constant mentions on variety shows and celebs. I knew some of them, so I could keep up, but if someone didn't, I think it would have been awkward for him to watch this drama, though it wouldn't effect the main plot or made it difficult to keep up. But, all in all, I did enjoy the multiple stories that overlapped one another and the drama was entertaining enough to keep the interest high till the end.

Not only can I relate to the story and the characters, but every movie making element I see is flawless in my mind. The acting is superb (with Lee Jung Jae sweeping the Lead Actor Awards in ' and gaining superstardom) and the direction is worthy of a standing ovation.Like Kim Sung Soo's previous movie Beat, this movie represents the lost generation in Korean society. The two main leads (one a boxer, the other a con man) are extremely different from each other but both depend on each other to survive in the harsh reality they live in. Together they go through life, only they both find out that greed, love and pride is just waiting to ruin their friendship.Gritty, realistic, funny, it's a film which viewers from all around the world should enjoy. If you like noir films or rebel films, this is the one for you", "I'm glad I threw away my reluctance to watch this film, what a treat. There was never a dull portion of the movie, kept going and sucked you in...great directing and flow here. The intensity between the main characters was incredible...credible acting and emotion which I like to see in a film (who doesn't??). Mimi (I knew it was Go Eun Han the moment I saw her walk out of Hong Gi's room) was a good addition to the group as a crutch to Do Chul not to mention nice eye candy ;) Her acting was credible as well for her early acting career at the time (debut movie?). All in all I highly recommend you watch this movie, you won't be disappointed...even the mediocre subtitles (at times and depending on which version you picked up) cannot ruin the intensity of this movie.", "This movie is at the extension of Beat, Sung Su Kim Woo Sung Jung combination's  hit. Of course, this movie is a bit different from Beat. Jung Jae Lee, another Korean stud actor, joined the combination and the female character, Mimi, has less value than Romi. Also the ending is also not as tragic as Beat.  However, Te yang eun up da still talks about depression of youth and their struggle for a better tomorrow in Wang Kar Wai like cinematography.  This movie is less violent and dynamic than Beat but the drama is more intense. Do Chul, a boxer, has a dream to be a champion but he's got some dieseas that makes him nose bleed during the game and faints him.  Hong Ki has a dream to be a millionaire and owns some buildings but all he can be is a hoodlum. They know that it's nearly impossible.Many people assert the importance of keeping the dream and the hope.  This movie asks if it's wise to go for the dreams when it seems impossible in reality.

It's the rd installment in the Flower Boy series and, like the other shows before it, it is extremely light in tone. You'd be hard pressed to think of too many other K dramas that are softer than this one is.SPOILERS AHEAD!First off, this show has nothing to do with flowers; flower boy is a Korean idiomatic expression that essentially means pretty boy. Our story begins by introducing the titular flower boy to the primary character (Go Dok Mi); Dok Mi is the shy shut in type girl who has a crush on the handsome young doctor she watches in the building across from hers. Dok Mi is perfectly content living alone in her apartment and interacting with no one; unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately, as the case may eventually be), Dok Mi's neighbors are an odd collection of outgoing personalities that become increasingly harder for her to avoid. The most prominent of these neighbors is the character named Enrique. He's the flower boy that catches Dok Mi spying on his doctor cousin, soon realizes she's a lost & lonely soul, and takes it upon himself to bring Dok Mi out of her shell and into the world around her. Actually, all the male neighbors are flower boys to some degree, but Enrique is the most flowery.Dok Mi is the way she is because of something that happened to her back in high school that made her not trust people and withdraw from society. Having a crappy high school experience doesn't really rank all that high on the life problem scale in the long run; when you're in high school though, or not far removed, there is nothing of greater importance than NOT having a crappy experience at that stage of your life, and, that's what we have here; a young woman who just can't get over her past and move on with her adult life.Park Shin Hye plays Dok Mi. She's pretty effective at portraying the perpetually weary sad eyed introvert who slowly begins to overcome her fears wounds as the series progresses. She gets the job done about as well as can be expected of what's asked of her. Yoon Si Yoon plays Enrique; the young and playful expatriate who has nothing better to do than dote on Dok Mi while he's back in Korea; he gives a nice enough performance as the relentlessly positive and energetic pretty boy who simply wants to help Dok Mi, but soon finds himself falling in love with her instead.The two secondary M F parts involve the guy that lives next to Dok Mi, and Dok Mi's former high school girlfriend. He's had a crush on Dok Mi for some time, but he's never been able to approach her in order to get close to her. It's an indication of how light this show is that neither he nor Enrique really even compete for Dok Mi via expected methods. Dok Mi's former schoolmate is the only antagonist here, but she barely even qualifies as one, as she and her gaggle of cohorts are about as bothersome as a litter of hungry kittens. She's a scheming spoiled brat of course, and she was rotten to Dok Mi back in school, but she's mostly pretty harmless overall. There are a number of small side stories as well (involving the kooky webtoon editor, the security guard, neighbors, etc). These side stories are mostly played for comedic & or romantic effect, and, they work well enough to serve as a compliment to the main story line.This show skews VERY young; the cast is packed full of attractive young people dealing with young people problems. This show is also frequently silly and sickeningly sweet, and the melodrama is so inconsequential in the scheme of things; nobody's dying, nobody will lose everything, nobody's family is at stake, etc. It's more of the I'm sorry your feelings were hurt, so here's some ice cream type melodrama. It's an effective series though that's fairly well written, performances are solid throughout, and it's well paced and nicely scored with an appropriately cutesy soundtrack, etc. There's not a whole lot of meat on its bones, and, it may contain the least amount of masculinity in any K drama I've ever seen (and that's saying something), but otherwise, there's really not much to dislike here.On the down side, there were two minor sub plots that didn't work very well; one involves the guy living next door having a secret rich family, and the other involves Enrique's troublemaking fan club. The former story was pointless and unnecessary, and the latter had too much importance placed on it. I also wasn't really fond of the way Dok Mi's suitors came across as borderline stalkers on occasion, who were blindly insistent that Dok Mi was in need of their help, when in fact, they had just as much growing up to do as she did; that was really the whole point of the show though (i.e. these guys help Dok Mi heal over time while she serves as the impetus for everybody to find out more about themselves, move forward in life, discover love, etc).Through it all, this show is consistently funny and charming, and, its biggest attribute is that it never loses sight of the fact that this is where its heart lies. The other thing going for this series is that it's sixteen  minute episodes, and I love this format because it results in very little time for filler or dragging things out, and everything's usually pretty snappy as a result. Get in, get out, move on to the next scene, episode, series, etc. I wish more K dramas utilized this format actually.Bottom Line: This is an adorable little show with a simple and approachable story, and, it's often quite good!...As a bonus, it's also easy to watch ignore while pretending you don't like it (in case you're too manly or mature to admit as much).Nicely done overall!... out of  stars!", "This was my first Korean Rom com . It's very intelligently written love triangle centering around a introvert girl .It's drags at times towards the last few episodes but that's a minor fault . for the major part , it's a very tight comedy which will end up you teaching a lot . I love quotes by the girl where she summaries what's going on in a very beautiful way in almost every episode . I felt they are kinda a profound or may be it's just my first Rom com :) . the shows doesn't bores you with a lot of fillers or drags , other support cast in the series are quite good and keep the interest ongoing", "Flower Boy Next Door is an enjoyable and engaging  episode Korean drama from  and is the third installment in cable network TVN's excellent Flower Boys series   Flower Boy Ramen Shop (loved), Shut Up Flower Boy Band (loved) and finally Flower Boy Next Door (loved).Video game designer Enrique is the human Energizer Bunny, fast talking, positive, and engaging.Work from home editor Dok Mi avoids human contact because of a scarring incident from her high school days.Enrique catches Dok Mi peeping out at her neighbor (and his cousin). Amazed the peeper is a quiet, shy, woman; Enrique is intrigued. He finds he intrinsically understands Dok Mi, which is unsettling to her.Next door a handsome web comic illustrator and writer live. The writer, Jin Rok, has secretly crushed on Dok Mi for years.What I loved about Flower Boy Next Door: . One True Pair (OTP) was darling and engaging. I loved Enrique's enthusiasm and dogged determination to draw out shy flower Dok Mi. Dok Mi dealt with her demons then in a turnabout, becomes the positive force while Enrique deals with his demons.. Next door neighbors were handsome and fun. Jin Rok was the perfect second lead, kind, caring, but misses his chance by hanging back too long. Roommate Dong Hoon was funny, handsome, and had his own cute love interest in raccoon eyed web comic manager, Seul gi. She steals every scene with her intense reactions.What I did not love about Flower Boy Next Door: . Dok Mi's high school demon Do Whee was a stock mean girl and was not appealing but irritating.. The storyline faded a bit in the latter third of the series. The story was strong while Dok Mi's re entered the world. The story faded when Enrique had his troubles, relying on clich\u00e9s and insufficient obstacles for a couple of episodes. The show ends on an upswing.. Third flower boy, Watanabe, had a tiny storyline and could easily have been dropped from the show. Enrique's friend and first love, Yoon hye, who loves his cousin, was more annoying than endearing.", "The second best drama of the flower boy series focuses on the story of an urban Rapunzel, who can't come out of her apartment. Due to some past trauma, the girl is afraid of socialising and she prefers to stay at home, spying on her neighbour, with whom she's in love with. That's until a friend of his from Spain moves in with him. So, the drama had a good love triangle dynamics, but, for me, the early resolution of the romance was the main element that killed this drama. Even though the cast was armed with some major names of the Korean industry, the romantic atmosphere wasn't delivered. Other than that, the drama was very light, with elements of a webtoon added here and there, making it fun and easy to watch. Following the flower boy saga pattern, it was consisted by bright colours and some unrealistic events. But, all in all, it was cute, so  out of ."], "Sentiment Score": 0.9924999999999999}, "1172": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1012": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["Running Man is a long running Korean variety show that began in  and is still airing today as of this review. It has become extremely popular all across Asia over its roughly  episode run time to date, and, it doesn't take long to see its universal appeal once you start watching it.SPOILERS AHEAD!There's nothing to spoil here; there's no linear story or end goal. More or less, it's just a simple comedy reality variety entertainment game show that airs on a weekly basis. I can't think of any show being televised in the west that's quite like it. It's a bit similar to Amazing Race, but its closest comparison is to other past KTV variety shows; X Man, Family Outing, & Infinite Challenge come to mind for obvious reasons.Basic premise: Seven regular cast members get together with a few different guest stars each week to compete in various missions that result in the loser(s) being embarrassed & or the winner(s) being rewarded. There's a heavy chase tag element to the show, along with a varying array of games, role playing, puzzle solving, and daring challenges. The cast use their wits, bravery, and or intuition in order to come out on top. It's usually very simple and silly stuff, but it does serve as an effective mechanism to deliver some solid entertainment along the way.The cast members are outstanding in their designated roles; they originally consisted of  dudes who were slotted to play various personas within the bigger picture of entertaining viewers. In addition, there's one female cast member who hopped on board, and she is awesome. Other than a few early adjustments, the original cast has mostly remained intact, and they work very well together as whole In order to make this show work. They all have their own successful careers as MC's, actors, singers, rappers, etc., but they all dutifully clock in each Monday morning to play their parts on this show. They really seem to enjoy each other's company as well, and they collectively exude a clear bond as some sort of secondary working family. Search any of the regular cast members if you need more info regarding them and or their specific roles on this show.I've been watching this show regularly since the very first episode. It was raw and had a very limited budget in the beginning, but you could clearly see its potential; it soon found its footing, started ascending the coveted KTV ratings chart, and it has been off and running ever since. It has evolved & diversified over time, namely; several new concept themes were added, and the show has been taken out of its confined late night settings in favor of operating in broad daylight in full view of the public. Otherwise, its basic original premise has mostly remained unchanged.This show doesn't have a fixed script per se, but it is produced and directed in such a way to achieve a desired outcome, so it's not reality by any means. The cast is basically informed as to what needs to be accomplished, then they set out to get the job done while hamming it up in typical KTV variety fashion. If need be, the show is nudged back in the right direction or a new direction, according to what's best for any given episode; fortunately, this is all done with as minimal heavy handedness as possible, so as not to disrupt the overall free flowing feel of the show. There's also a unique balance & symmetry at play with these Korean variety reality shows between directors, cast, crew, guests, production teams, editing dept., etc...Everybody seems to be on the same page to try to achieve what is best for the overall good of the show.There is a lot to like here. The show is packed full of fantastic guest stars on a regular basis, and the way it engages itself with the general public is fascinating to watch play out; normal citizens going about their everyday lives could soon find themselves involved in helping out the cast members accomplish whatever silly mission is at hand for that day. It also serves as sort of a Korean tourism guide and cultural experience; if you were ever planning on visiting Korea, you could literally use this show as your travel itinerary as to where to go and what to do, see, eat, experience, etc.On the down side, the cast (who I dearly love) can be a tad annoying with their antics and clamoring for screen time (particularly the MC, who's otherwise very effective when not acting too much the clown), and it's sometimes hard to make all + minutes of a particular show entertaining when you only have + hours of footage to edit. The show has likely already peaked as well, and it's hard to imagine it getting any better or sustaining its pace; it's simply becoming increasingly difficult to keep the show fresh & I'm not sure how long everyone involved can keep this phenomenon going. Inevitably, all good things must come to an end, but if & or when they ever call it quits, or various cast and or crew members have to move on in life, etc., there is no doubt that this show will have had an incredibly successful run!Summary; this show has been consistently entertaining and often wildly hilarious throughout its duration. Once it finds its rhythm, there are very few episodes that have disappointed in delivering very family friendly fun and entertainment on a weekly basis. If you have not been watching Running Man, you have missed out on one of the best TV shows, from any country, in years.Bottom Line: Don't Walk, Run to watch this show before it's too late!... out of  stars!... HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!", "No need to hide the fact that a lot variety shows have evolved since Infinity Challenge (Muhan Dojeon). And to be honest I do think Running Man was inspired by it. The chasing game, action blockbuster style was first done on Infinity Challenge but of course, Running Man bring their own creativity to the table.The show started out with  Running Men but added Song Ji hyo as the th but then Song Joong ki left and so it's still  members till this date.This show is certainly a must watch. It dwells in humorous psychological battle and then comes the physical war and in between you've got romance bromance and family.The show also offers themed episode to match the current trending movie or drama. They've also pay tribute to all time favorite movies which makes me find myself reminisce.The solid performance from the Nation's MC, Yoo Jae suk has brought the show to a new level in variety world. Kim Jong Kook is certainly a tough guy on the outside but vulnerable on the inside. Haha with vast variety experiences has no problem standing proud with his wits. Ji Suk Jin first attempt at outdoor variety show does have it flaws but he's done great given his age. Newcomers Lee Kwang soo, Kang Gary and Song Ji hyo are not afraid to go all out and give their everything to entertain the viewers.I know that Running Man started out with determination making their own flavor and style but recently I find most episodes a bit repetitive and lost it poise. Members' characters has become stagnant. Since everyone is now doing more jobs (thanks to Running Man popularity), it feels like they don't try to make improvement in this show. I know it's not easy to make people laugh but I wish something more and new on other departments; action, romance.I give a  because there's still room for improvement. I hope Running Man will survive just like IC and continue to save me from my weekly distress.", "Last year, when SBS said that this program will be stopped. I understood that It is a big change and development. But, it survived!

Members are Song Ji Hyo, Yoo Jae Suk, Kim Jong Kook, Haha, Kang Gary, Lee Kwang Soo, Ji Suk Jin and Joong Ki(which is now currently not on running man). To me, it is quite funny and interesting. I am constantly watching it and I most likely have kind of watch finish all the episodes(except for some I overlooked) and waiting for new ones", "Easily my favorite television show of all time. Every Sunday night I have a special treat where i log on and watch my  min Running Man show. I have a smile on my face for an hour and a half. Each show is unpredictable. The members show up for work and are given missions. They might work together or individually or break up into teams. They often have guests. Just appearing on running man can turn a previously unknown into a beloved member of the running man family. So how did i get from watching American television to watching a foreign (South Korean) television show with subtitles? Well bored one night from the usual tv, i googled indie film festival winner. and a Korean movie came back as the result. I watched it and to my surprise the actors lips weren't moving independent of their voices .. they weren't flying thru the sky in impossible kung foo leaps on a grainy tv picture.. what i watched was a drama with as high quality filming acting and writing as i have ever seen. So i watched two more, then completely captivated went for gold and googled best Korean movie. That came back as jewel in the palace. watched that and to this day i watch more Korean TV than American. I don't even notice subtitles anymore unless they are missing. Back to running man. So i wanted to see more of my now favorite movie stars (who were are South Korean) i came across running man as it had guests on the shows. I could watch my favorite stars outside the box you might say. Next thing i knew my favorite stars included the running man cast. They went to Dubai where i shared my amazement with theirs at the gold vending machines, the great barrier reef in Australia where they dove for treasure chests to Hong Kong and the great wall of china. Not to mention fantastic places all over South Korea. I learned a lot of parlor games and games which could be used at birthday parties. I love some of the running side themes which carry over between episodes, such as the James Bond like cast member. the spartan and the betrayer. Sometimes they acquire super powers.. or travel through time or even visit Alice in wonderland. There are missions with Korean food and culture. some of the funnier episodes have a public mission with one or more spies who have a secret mission, their own path to victory."], "Sentiment Score": 0.48857142857142855}, "1300": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "907": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "963": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "124": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "42": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1276": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "427": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["I watched this entire series very late at night.

A theme throughout the show is to follow your heart not your head for happiness. The writer wrote the better known My Name is Kim Sam Soon (). The drama centers around a middle class mother and her  daughters. Byung Hee, the older daughter, is  and a reporter for a men's magazine. Joon Hee, the younger daughter, is  and a model. Byung Hee's best friend has a younger brother, Chul Su, who returns after a  year around the world trek. Byung Hee gets drunk one night and Chul Su is sent to bring her home safely. They end up sleeping together. Chul Su pursues Byung Hee but she's afraid of the age difference and rebuffs him in favor of a more age appropriate doctor. Chul Su won't give up and Byung Hee eventually realizes she loves him. Family opposition and the army provide the obstacles for our couple after that.What I liked about What's Up Fox: . Likable couple. The actor playing our male lead, Chul Su, was cute and appealing. The actress playing our female lead, Byung Hee, had good chemistry with the male lead and excelled portraying the character's struggle to take the risk to date a younger man. . Equally likable secondary couple. The younger sister had a interesting hate to love relationship with a much older man (she was  and he was ). You never found out what the secret of his bum was though. . Realistic ending. Neither couple walked into the sunset holding hands but you felt each couple was going to make a solid go of their relationship. Our main couple has to deal with tough questions and does not provide the easy out. Their relationship evolves and has merit because of the obstacles they overcome together. What I was less fond of: . Chul Su's sister was a bit over the top in her negative reaction to her brother and best friend finding love. When she submitted him for the  year army stint, that was a low blow. .

I didn't realize that Happiness of the Katakuris was a remake of this film until I watched Happiness and looked it up on IMDb. I had never heard of this film before. South Korean films do not exactly get a great amount of publicity in the U.S., unfortunately.Unlike Miike's remake, which is a very good film in its own right, The Quiet Family doesn't have bizarre claymation, it's not a musical, there aren't singing and dancing zombie corpses, and there isn't some karmic disturbance of an equivalent to Mt. Fuji. This is a much quieter and understated film, but it's still a black (morbid or macabre) comedy drama about a horrific, bad situation that just keeps getting worse.The story concerns Tae gu Kang, who has bought a small hotel (unlike Happiness of the Katakuris' much simpler bed & breakfast) in a relatively remote hiking area. He moves his family  his wife, son, two daughters and his brother  to the hotel, where they wait for guests to arrive. No one shows up. When they eventually do get a guest, it's a strange, solitary, older man who ends up committing suicide with his hotel key chain. The man's wallet, which seemed to contain a substantial sum of cash, is missing. Worried that the authorities will never believe them that it was a suicide, especially given their son's troubled past, and worried that the situation will create bad publicity for their hotel, they decide to bury the body on their property. Other guests begin trickling in, but for some reason or another, they all meet less than favorable fates. Just how much bad luck will the Kangs have, and just how far will they go to surmount it? Even though this is a morbid comedy, director Ji woon Kim employs very deliberate art house drama pacing and tonalities. The cinematography is interesting throughout, and recurrent motifs include sustained, almost motionless shots of daughter Mi na Kang (Ho kyung Go), who is implied as an emotional center for the family (and indeed, she's the only one who remains relatively even keeled throughout the bizarre occurrences). There are also many slow tracking or zoom shots of the beautifully decorated and colored hallways of the hotel (this is one of the conspicuous influences on the film Darkness, which has similar color and decoration schemes).Another center for the Kangs is mealtime. We see them eating many times throughout the film  it's a way for them to gather their bearings, if possible, and figure out their plan of attack. One nicely symbolic scene shows everyone refraining from eating at the table except for Mi na and her sister Mi su (Yun seong Lee), as the family initially keeps the girls in the dark about the macabre goings on.Kim, who also wrote The Quiet Family in addition to directing, even spoofs the typical art house drama romance, with a man who courts Mi su a little too fervently and of course meets a twisted fate. This sets off a chain of events that lead to a very funny climax.The crux of the film is the ever escalating occurrences and humorous attempts to cover them up. This provides amusing subtexts about how good intentions can lead to severely immoral actions (and the guests even get in on this subtext a bit), but at the same time, we empathize with the protagonists, as the Kangs, at least, may be making bad judgments, but if they don't, they could face worse consequences. This is a quiet family that wants to remain quiet. While I prefer the bizarreness of Happiness of the Katakuris, at least slightly, The Quiet Family is still a very good film, and you just might prefer it if your tastes lean more towards art house dramas than the surreal and over the top.", "When a family reluctantly becomes proprietors of an inn deep in the woods, it seems doubtful anyone could find their way there. It doesn't help that the family ends up killing nearly all of their guests    usually under cover of night (and the blackest possible humor). Imagine Hitchcock's The Trouble with Harry steered by a gruesomely dysfunctional family, and you have some idea of what this deadpan South Korean film offers. Still more evidence of that country's continuing film renaissance, and easily up to the standard of the best American films.", "I can't account for the lackluster ratings for this on IMDB (though its primary domestic distribution right now is bootleg video, which might account for something.) I saw it at the movies, and it rates as one of the great South Korean black comedies. A bit like Hitchcock, this tells the story of a family that takes over an inn deep, deep in the country   only realizing when they get there it was a big mistake. For one thing, they're miles from any human being. Things take a turn for the macabre when their visitors and guests end up dying under ambiguous circumstances, and the family has to find some way of disposing of the bodies before the cops roll in. Of course, they eventually do come to investigate, making the tale even more twisted than it was before.Don't let any prejudices against South Korean cinema keep you away; at its best, their film output is second to none, and attracts international favor from film festivals and critics. This film is one of the unequivocal winners.", "This is Kim Ji woon's debut film. He would go on to direct A Tale of Two Sisters, The Good, The Bad, the Weird and I Saw the Devil. The Quiet Family is probably most famous for being remade by Takashi Miike a few years later as The Happiness of the Katakuris. Miike's film is far more zany, and it's a ton of fun. Kim's film is probably a little bit better. It doesn't contain any musical numbers, zombies or sequences animated in clay. It's quite well directed, though there are some plot holes and loose threads. Kang ho Song (Thirst, The Host) and Min sik Choi (Oldboy, Failan) are the most recognizable of the five family members who own a remote mountain inn. Their business is doing poorly. After a few weeks, their first customer shows up. He dies. Probably a suicide, but it looks like murder. The family decides to bury them. More bad luck follows as nearly each and every guest who shows up at the inn dies under horrific circumstances. The family just keeps burying the bodies. The film is morbidly hilarious. It kind of gets sloppy around the end, but it's hugely amusing the whole way through. Probably my favorite of Kim's films that I've seen so far", "This film manages to strike a very tricky balance between humor and suspense.  It's funny and tense all at the same time, from start to finish.It's visually appealing, with interesting characters, and high production values.

But this detective is also on a quest to exact revenge on the man who violently ruined his family's life  years ago. The journey will inevitably take some unexpected turns. This is a film that may divide audiences, due to its off kilter approach to a number of different genres, time periods and visual styles, using the framework of a hard  boiled detective story to metaphorically glance at various hardships Korea has endured over the past  years. It takes a little while for the film's rhythm to take hold, but once it does and you completely click into its particular point of view, it becomes more entertaining as it goes on. Writer director Jo Sung hee, who impressed with the minimalist, post apocalyptic END OF ANIMAL and the romance drama fantasy A WEREWOLF BOY, again moves down a different path, with a film that is heavily influenced by comic books and pulp crime novels. His smart blend of camera technique, lighting schemes, CGI animation, and set design makes this a feast for the eyes, and if it is screening at a cinema nearby, then I highly recommend that you go and experience it on the big screen.Lee Je hoon, who caught people's attention with his performances in the first rate but appropriately titled BLEAK NIGHT and the acclaimed Korean War drama THE FRONT LINE, is very good as detective Gil dong, and the relationship that develops between he and the two girls is genuinely affecting. However, he doesn't quite command the screen in the way needed to make a film like this truly soar (say like Park Hae il), but on the strength of his work here, you know that day is not far away. Kim Seong gyoon proves intimidating as the brutal Kang Sung il, but the film is stolen by young actors Kim Ha na (as Mal soon) and No Jeong ee (as Dong yi), who are utterly charming as Gil dong's hindrance come helpers. The director gets remarkably natural and confident performances from the two youngsters, thankfully free of cloyingly sweet mannerisms and cheap sentimentality.The less you know about the plot details the better, as Jo Sung hee's final vision may be somewhat contrary to what you might be expecting. But it's a surprise that definitely leaves a smile on your face when the end credits begin to roll, and has you already looking forward to what this talented film maker will do next.", "Hong Gil dong (Lee Je hoon) is a detective with a mission: to find the man who murdered his mother in front of his childhood self and avenge her death. For years, he has worked as a detective in the large organization headed by the sister of the wealthy family that adopted him, learning the skills he needs to track this killer down. When he finally has his target in sight, however, members of a mysterious gang kidnap the man, leaving his two young granddaughters distraught and not sure where to turn. Hong tells the girls that he can find their relative, but he needs them to come with him on the journey, and so the three set off together. The girls hope Hong will save their grandfather, but they don't know the reason he's hunting him\u0085. That's a very brief description of the set up of this extremely convoluted story; there are more twists and turns here than I've seen in a film in a very long time! Nobody is who they seem to be and nobody's motives are what they appear. Well, except maybe for the two girls   I wish I knew the names of the child actors, who are excellent (particularly the  year old, perpetually snot faced, younger kid). There's an awful lot to like in this movie, both because of its hard boiled aspect, its tender one and its sheer over the top action. One thing I'm not sure of is its time frame; there are references (visual and otherwise) to the s, but the clothing and cars, among other indications, seem to hark back to the s. If that anachronistic visualization doesn't derail you, however, you're in for a heck of a packed, exciting and ultimately satisfying two hours!", "Note: Check me out as the Asian Movie Enthusiast on YouTube, where I review tons of Asian movies.Our protagonist (a detective, of course) works day to day to track down missing persons. One day, he finally finds the man who murdered his mother (when he was a child), but the murderer gets kidnapped and the detective must track down the criminals responsible. At the same time, however, he is forced to watch over two little girls (the murderer's grandchildren) who are tagging along for the ride. Unfortunately, the kidnappers work for a shadowy organization that has no qualms about eliminating anyone who stands in their way.This movie has a very noir ish feel to it, with a lot of investigation that leads our protagonist from place to place as he narrates his thoughts. He even wears the old school detective hat and coat, which gives him a classical look. The lead actor is Je hoon Lee, who previously starred in Bleak Night and appeared in The Front Line (both of which are very good movies, by the way). The Phantom Detective provides even more evidence that this guy can legitimately carry a movie. He does a good job of portraying a man who is proficient at his job, but is still vulnerable and can get in over his head.The dynamic between him and the girls is somewhat unorthodox. However, it's also endearing because the kids don't immediately know that he wants to take revenge on their grandfather, but they do figure out fairly early on that he is a habitual liar \u2013 and this gives some leeway for the filmmakers to pepper in some humorous exchanges of dialogue between them. In addition, one of the girls breaks out a notepad and takes down information while he questions people, almost as if she were a detective herself. This is entertaining stuff that safely avoids the annoying little kid clich\u00e9 that can really hurt a movie. So basically, there are no weak points when considering the acting in this movie \u2013 everyone holds their own.In terms of action \u2013 there are a handful of gun battles and fist fights, none of which are graphically violent, but they do have a hard hitting feel to them that adds a weight and danger to everything. The action design has a higher octane feel to it, without the need for going over the top or chucking in cartoonish set pieces. Everything is grounded here, and that's important in this case due to the tone and type of film we're dealing with. Sure, we have three likable leads, but there are some dangerous people in this movie. One such person is the main bad guy, who makes multiple appearances throughout as he stalks the protagonists. And let me tell you, he's one tough son of a gun too. Now, I won't spoil the ending for you, but what I will say is that it's very satisfying.There are a few stylistic flourishes that are used for the buildings and environments at times, which utilize some artificial visuals. I know some critics have complained a bit about these particular special effects, but I thought it was a neat idea that gave this film some charm. You know, I have to say, The Phantom Detective feels like something that would have come out of U.S. during the s. This is the kind of movie that Hollywood doesn't like to make anymore. And I definitely recommend it.", "At the beginning I was reluctant to watch it. As I love Korean cinema I thought watching this won't be the most enjoyable experience however you are enchanted by the unusual setting and likable characters very quickly.

They consist of two men and two women who I guess are all Gumiho (or whatever their male counterparts are, since I've always known them to be female). Gumihos are nine tailed foxes who live a really long time, have powerful abilities and skills, and can take on human form. In this story, they once lived in harmony with humans in the distance past but were betrayed and soon driven to near extinction. They still live in small numbers in the present however, and many of them have a thirst for human livers in order to survive.Our good Gumihos, need to hunt down the bad Gumihos to keep the humans safe, and they need to this without the humans finding out about them. The four of them have varying skills and use different weapons to do their job (various swords and bladed arms and the like). They are also, naturally, all young and incredibly good looking, and each of them love one of the others in typical Korean melodrama fashion. The lone exception to all of these love angles between themselves, is one girl who gets involved with a human police officer. This cop gets assigned to a secret task force that's aware of the Gumiho's existence, and are trying to destroy them.There's too many story lines involved in this series.

Even if you're not usually into family dramas, I really do think you might like this one.It's engaging and well paced despite its sprawling cast and multiple narrative arcs, and the characters feel like real people, even when things lean a little treacly at times.I enjoyed almost every character in this show, but my hands down favorite is Lee Yoo Ri as Hye Young. She is \u2013 in a word \u2013 Awesome. I think I didn't even know what I wanted in an awesome female character, until Hye Young exploded onto my screen.In the myriad of romantic relationships in this drama world, the one that stood out to me the most was between Dad and Mum (Kim Young Chul and Kim Hae Sook). Beyond the flush of courtship that their kids went through at various stages of our story, to me, the longstanding affection and care that Dad and Mum had for each other was even more beautiful and moving. I love that in the big and little things, they unfailingly stood by each other, and supported each other, and demonstrated love, care and concern for each other. Even when they disagreed and argued, it was clear that they never stopped caring about each other. If anything, any disagreement they had tended to be rooted in a deep sense of concern for each other. Serious relationship goals, truly. \u2764In this kind of family drama where I know going in, that we're highly likely to get a happy ending all around, it's more important to me how we get to that happy ending, and the nuances around the journey, rather than the happy ending itself.

This doctor soon realizes Shi Ohn's autism allows him to absorb and retain all sorts of medical knowledge that a normal person couldn't. Shi Ohn is encouraged to learn and study everything he can until he grows to adulthood, wherein he's given an internship at a children's hospital to see if he can put his extraordinary mind to use in real world practice.Unfortunately, the autism that makes Shi Ohn so knowledgeable in the first place, also makes it difficult for him to communicate with people and grasp the nuances of social interaction in an imperfect society. He can't express his emotions properly, has trouble understanding his own feelings, and can't comprehend why people act and do the things they do (much less understand lies, jokes, ulterior motives, etc). Since he's both incredibly book smart and socially awkward, he's as equally resented as he is feared by his contemporaries; his genius might be able to solve problems they cannot, but he also might do something incredibly stupid that would put lives and careers at risk. Thus, a tentative relationship is born between Shi Ohn and everyone that now surrounds him to see if he can begin to fit in to society and be of help to the hospital and its patients.This is a little bit of an unusual show for a K drama. It's more of a straight forward drama about the growth of an autistic man, and those around him, more than anything else. It does retain many familiar elements of this genre; there's some melodrama, antagonists, character growth, a little humor, and somewhat of a romantic angle, but if you're looking for some juicy or outrageous or angst ridden makjang drama, this ain't the show for you.Joo Won is the star of the show in his portrayal of Shi Ohn. This could not have been an easy part to play, but Joo Won is up to the task and remarkably believable throughout. He's got all the autistic mannerisms and ticks down pat, but more impressive is the way he's able to convey his emotions in such an effective manner without breaking character. He has to deal with a lot; being bullied, reconciling with his estranged parents, sorting out his first feelings of love, living on his own, making friends, handling disappointment, and overcoming his disability, all while he's trying to prove himself as a capable doctor and basically just get by in life. Joo Won really drives this show with his performance, and the more things progress, the more you can almost sense what he's thinking & feeling without him even uttering a word. Nicely done, Joo Won!Joo Sang Wook & Moon Chae Won fill the other  most prominent parts; Joo Sang Wook plays the head doc in charge of the children's ward, and Moon Chae Won plays the prominent young female doc in the wing. Both of them were quite efficient at portraying opposite ends of the spectrum that help Shi Ohn in their own way. He's demanding and won't approve of Shi Ohn until he's satisfied, and she's kindly and supportive of Shi Ohn at almost every turn. The rest of the cast is rounded out by some hospital trustee upper management types, the kids in the sick ward, and the rest of interns & docs & nurses; they were all effective enough in their roles portraying an antagonist or benefactor or side story character or what have you.Writing, direction, and production were solid. The story is relatively well told, and it does make its way from start to finish rather well without ever getting too bogged down. And, of course, it all looks great on screen; this is modern day HD KTV after all, so that's almost a given with any show that's provided at least a modest budget.If I have any complaints to level against this show, it would be the attempt to (SPOILERS) incorporate a love angle between Moon Chae Won's character and Shi Ohn; this show probably would have better off without that aspect, and, instead just stuck to its overall motif of overcoming adversity and character growth. I suppose I could complain some about some of the annoying young hospital kids, and the standard drive by method of giving short shrift to various medical terms & disorders, but young kids usually can't act very well anyway, and, you can't expect the writers & cast to be experts in the medical field when considering the inherent time constraints involved with airing these shows.Summary: It isn't going to work for everybody, but I must admit that I quite enjoyed this show for the most part. The story is better than decent, there are several good performances (Joo Won, in particular, is outstanding), and, I thought everything was fairly well executed overall. It's ultimately a fairly sweet K drama tale about a disadvantaged man coping with life, and, the realization that he's not really any better or worse at accomplishing this than any normal person trying to do the same. I actually found this to be a somewhat unique & rather heartwarming show (and, I'm saying this as a jaded, long time viewer of KTV melodramas).Bottom Line: Well Recommended!  out of  stars on the KTV Drama Scale!", "I just came to know about this show from the remake. I must say original one is far far better than the remake. It will make you cry in every episodes and this is one of the best series i have watched so far.

The acting of the male lead is ok.I have come accross many autistic children myself.

The premise was an interesting one, and I feel the writers, directors and producers did a superb job of bring this to life on screen. Special recognition has to go to the truly superb acting performance of Joo Won. How he kept all of those mannerisms up throughout the series was amazing. Chae Won Moon also deserves a special mention too. Her interplay with the other characters really helped bring the show alive, and the fact that she lights up the screen whenever she's on it makes it very pleasant watching. I devoured the whole series in less than a month and there wasn't one period during that time when I lost interest. Gripping stuff. Oh, and one more thing. Good Doctor had good positive messages throughout and didn't rely on sex and violence to keep the viewer hooked.

It's sad to see that some of you are too busy critiquing the lack of complexity in the plot, because it is this simplicity that makes this movie so beautiful. Since many of you have already reiterated the plot, i'll just cut the chase and try to clear up some confusion, hopefully.First of all, to understand why he let the girl go and turns against his boss, the flashback towards the end is very crucial. When she plays the cello, he smiles, and as he is dying, he smiles as he listens to her voice. These are the only two occasions in which he smiles throughout the entire movie. Whether this is love, attraction, or because he was thankful that she made him feel good, is open to interpretation. Given that he is an extremely straightforward and honest character(and also given that in this movie, everything is what you see on the screen  there are no hidden motives, twists, whatsoever), I assume that the reason he doesn't answer (or CAN'T answer) when asked why he did it by his boss is because he doesn't know himself. I think the key to understanding this movie is the title, and the narration at the end of the movie (something along the line of a disciple telling his master that he cries after a sweet dream because he knows it can't come true). For Sunwoo,the girl and his belief(?) that he can kill everyone else and still live are sweet dreams that cannot come true. The reason why he unrealistically gets by after getting shot and stabbed so much, is not simply because he is the main character, but because everything he does after meeting the girl is like a sweet 'dream', a surreal reality(yes, an oxymoron, just like the title  a 'bittersweet' life). The morbid ending is also very fitting  as sweet as the dream was, the more bitter it is when he wakes up from it and faces reality(once again relating to the last narration).", "This masterpiece comes from the director of Tales of Two Sisters and he delivers an epic tale of revenge.I can't urge you enough to see this movie. The gun battles are reminiscent of Scarface, the martial arts are gritty and realistic, the poignancy of unrequited love is painful, there is a deep philosophical current that underlies this film, and the camera work is superb but that's not what carries the movie. The actor who plays the main character is what sets this magnificent movie apart from the trash put out by Hollywood. He's a man's man sharply dressed in well tailored suits driving in a BMW sedan (like the transporter)through beautiful Seoul (showing what a beautiful, spotless, and vibrant city it is). He reaches the point of no return and his vengeance and determination are a tour de force.Magnificent. Bravo. South Korean films reign supreme.", "I could sit here and start this review off any number of ways to make this film sound ultra important. I could say, once in a great while a film comes along, blah, blah. Or, Only a select few films ever have reached this, blah, blah. Or I could say, if you see one movie this year, blah, blah. You know the drill. These are the opening sentences the big boy critics use when they really want you to see a flick and when they want a particular review to really stand out. Well, films that deserve this kind of special praise really do only come around once in a great while. Unbelievably, I have seen two in only six months time. The first was what I like to call the first real st Century film, and that was Oldboy. And the second film of this status also comes from Korea, believe it or not, and it is Bittersweet Life.Bittersweet Life is probably one of the most simple, most streamlined modern films I have ever seen. It is lean, mean, and like its lead male, a damn ruthless fighting machine. The film beats along with its Raymond Chandler like screenplay with all the jazz and style of early 's John Woo and with the energy and themes of Quentin Tarantino's grind house 's. Life plays with your emotions, making you care for the bad guy hero even though he is a vicious killer, and causes one to release tension through laughter when the blood starts gushing like a dozen ruptured fire hoses. Wholesale death, blood by the gallons, broken bones and multiple beatings with humongous pipe wrenches, two by fours, and lead pipes are on order, right after a heaping dish of innocent love and a guy trying for once to do the right thing.The plot, well you see, it's like this: you can see everything coming a mile away, the movie plays it straight, and follows the exact path you know it will and the exact path you hope it will. There are no twist endings, no complicated triple crosses, no hidden motives for the characters. Everything on screen happens the way you see it, and everything thing ends exactly the way you picture it. And this is a good thing. The film is so on track that it doesn't need a twist or a swerve to make you pay attention. It starts at A, ends at E, and hits B, C and D on the way there. Life is so steeped in its genre tropes of noir character and themes that the ending is know to all of us before it even starts. However, it's the journey that matters, and I'll be damned if you can find a better looking, more brutally violent journey anywhere.As much as I try to analyze the film, nothing comes to mind. And this is the purest of all compliments. The film is as shallow as the pools of blood splattered in the hallways, alleyways and run down exteriors of the sets. Often times a director feels the need to bog a simple story down with twists, and a deeper meaning to hide the fact that they are afraid to just let things happen because they need to happen. Bittersweet Life is not one of these films. It exists with its soul laid bare for all to see, and when the carnage is complete, you thank the film for being honest with itself. As the final credits roll you might find yourself asking, Is that it? Yes, that is it\u0097cinematic perfection. It is all it needs to be: pure and simple, boisterous and calm, bloody and drenched in gore and an honest movie with nothing to hide.   genrebusters", "This is my first review on here, only because I felt compelled to tell someone about this film\u0085 When I say coolest, I don't mean it in a that movie was really cool kind of way\u0085 Coolest, in this case, means that it is the smoothest, well crafted, stylish, and beautiful films I have ever seen. Everything about the film has a you'll never be this cool feel, like Jules and Vincent from Pulp Fiction. Not to mention the fact that it has the same sort of humor.Now, I am a film student who has actually gotten a lot of praise from students and teachers and whatnot for my first film project\u0085 That's great and all, but after seeing this film I am reminded of what Steven Spielberg said after he saw The Godfather; I guess I should quit now, because I will never make something this good.

''A Bittersweet Life (Talkomhan Insaeng)'' is what Korean critics are describing as ''Action Noire.'' In it, he tweaks the traditional Korean gangster story line, presenting a work with film noire undertones and stylish cinematography.Sun woo (Lee Byung hun) is a revenging dark angel dressed in black. Gang leader Kang (Kim Young cheol) assigns Sun woo, his right hand man, to watch after his nubile girlfriend professional cellist Hee soo (Shin Mina) while he is away and find out about the other guy with whom he suspects she is messing around.The plot is complicated by Sun woo's existential decision to stray from the explicit instructions with which he is charged. He is cryptically told time and again to make good on a promise, but he never exactly know what that is.Much of the action occurs in the long shadows the sprawling megapolis Seoul casts. Here, the gangsters wish they were too cool to be killed. No friend can really be trusted as the good guys are not so good and the bad guys can be down right evil. Importantly, the motivation of his tormentors is shrouded in mystery.But the movie has been labeled ''action noire'' for a good reason. The stylistic ultra violence of director Kim is superb. The creepy fisherman killer represents a unique Korean twist on the classic film noire villain. Our hero is not a good, good guy either, and I loved that about him. He is not only tough, but also a stone face killer _ a tribute to both the director and actor's character interpretation.After all, gangsters should fight to kill, and that means sometimes going for the knees and other joints, hitting low and dirty to take the guy out quick. In general, the fight scenes were creative.

It's funny, romantic af and the chemistry between the leads is off the charts. The male lead is fantastic, the female lead is super cute and the supporting cast is awesome too. Basically, Secretary Kim has been working for nine years as the assistant of the Vice Chairman of a company and now she's resigning. Why? She's paid off the debts of her father and sisters, and is ready to have a life of her own. For nine years, she's been at the Vice Chairman's beck and call, at night, in the weekend and even during holidays. On top of that, her boss is self absorbed to the point of narcissism. So, she's done.The Vice Chairman is shocked when she announces her decision to quit   because he thinks he is the best boss and most perfect guy ever   and immediately starts to come up with schemes to get her to stay. Somehow he gets it into his pretty little head that Secretary Kim is in love with him, so he starts to woo her. With hilarious results, because she hates his guts.Seriously, just watch this series! It's so good and so satisfying. You'll laugh and cry and sigh (mostly laugh and sigh, though, at how adorable the main couple is). The male lead is gorgeous and hilarious, the female lead has got a great evil smirk, the sound effects are the best and the side stories of the other characters are absolutely worth your time too. I'm probably just going to watch the whole series again real soon, because watching anything else after this can only lead to disappointment.", "What's Wrong with Secretary Kim is just an okay drama. It has a cute approach to the story, that also involves some mystery about a kidnapping and a chilhood drama, but they kind of overeploit that theme and it got tiring towards the end. The romance, for me, it was so so. There was chemistry and everything, but the script didn't help to create the right mood. In the end, the romance scenes seemed forced to be funny when they weren't. The performances, in addition, were nice and enjoyable at least. The side stories interesting as well.

Actually, I really like super powers fantasy etc. but the mind reading in this story was a bit strange   we weren't suggested any explanation for it and it seemed to come and go for strange reasons (it appeared because of an intense trauma and then went away when the character lost his memories, only for him to regain his powers the moment he remembered the trauma in question). The romance is cute and all the characters are very entertaining, with strong personalities (even the small side characters manage to be easy to remember). Anyway... because I'm too lazy to write a long review I'm just going to say that I recommend this to those that can get into a pretty long story (the episodes are h long and A LOT of things happen all the time) with a bit of interesting debates on ethics (and law).", "I love this drama! I just watched in two days and just sleep  hours I'm a total sucker for Lee Bo Young romances and Lee Jong Suk, the writer knows how to touch our hearts! The plot arrangement was very very impressive and the characters combination was suitable with the storyline. Many messages that i got from this drama. After watching episode  learning the true meaning of Hearing people's voice, the feeling I got is something I have never felt before... Once again I have to give it to Korean story. Better than anything i have seen so far. Excellent performance by all the casts specially Lee Bo Young. This is must watch drama", "This is the first drama I've watched where Lee Jong Suk was one of the lead actors. I was simply amazed and kept wanting to watch the next episode, no wonder they added a few episodes after they reached the initial announced number and of course I get now why the series received so many awards.Lee Jong Suk plays someone who has gained the ability to read minds, after he was involved in a car accident which killed his father when he was a child. The driver who hit the car, actually aimed at killing both father and child, however the main actress was present and even though she was intimidated into not going to court to testify whether the accident was no accident, she did go. The series starts basically from the point both main actors grew up. It is interesting how they meet, how they work together and how they protect one another. I would suggest this series to anyone as I believe it can match the tastes of any viewer.", "I have always loved court room dramas and legal thrillers  books, movies, soaps and sitcoms. I like those well written scripts that take advantage of the loopholes in law to build powerful twists in the plots, keeping the audience or viewers engaged till the end. 'I hear your voice' is a romantic comedy  my most favorite of Korean drama genres, with the right amount of courtroom cases, and a bit of fantasy. The episodes were an easy watch, interesting and entertaining. He is a high school kid who can hear people's thoughts. These extra voices in his ears make his world noisier. She is a lawyer  a public defender, quite a few years older than him. She is his first love. He admired her since she came as a witness of his father's murder to the trial  years ago. Searching for her when he grew up, he found her on the pages of a newspaper. Then as they became closer, from just acquaintances in a case, he starts helping her during trials  by reading everyone's minds; and she takes the responsibility of his guardian. It's just fun to watch them \u2013 when she tries to hide her humiliations and embarrassed thoughts from him, but he reads them anyhow. I like the plot twists a lot. The prisoner of  years is now released, who holds a grudge against the public defender, as she had been a witness to that murder, and threatens to kill her.

This is a great show.As my title implies, I'm an old school (and old) rocker from the prior century. The concept of the boy band, when it first appeared in the s with the likes of New Kids on the Block, was an affront to my existence. And I was also somewhat skeptical of the K pop and J pop scenes, and I couldn't imagine that a prettyboy band could be nearly as funny as Spinal Tap with its raw, ridiculous, flat out nuts musicians. But read on...You're Beautiful, despite its less than sensational title, has some of the weirdest characters imaginable. And that's what makes it hilariously entertaining for musicians and non musicians alike. My favorite character is Kang, the creepy gothboy lead singer who is a germophobe (fear of dirt), agoraphobe (fear of crowds), haphephobe (fear of being touched), ataxophobe (fear of disorder), and on top of it all he's afraid of the dark, too. Despite all this, he maintains a facade of cool and absolute control which he asserts in a most tyrannical way over the others. Second in command is Hwang the lead guitarist who is the antithesis of the singer. He is a gentle, wise, friendly Buddha type person who seems better suited for monkhood than a pop band. Bringing up the bottom is Jeremy the drummer. Alas, poor drummers. They are always portrayed as the dimmest tube in the amp, and Jeremy is no exception. So thick that he can barely count to  to bring in the band, Jeremy is a refreshing gust of pure comic relief who balances out the moments of heavy drama (and despite this being a breezy comedy, there can be some heavy moments). And of course there's our hero heroine Go Mi Nam who is exactly the way you'd expect a teenage nun to be, having been forced to masquerade as a boy in the nation's top pop band.That brings me to the plot which you probably know already, but I'll recap: A teenage nun ends up masquerading as a boy in the nation's top pop band. But don't let the simplicity of that premise fool you. At times it gets surprisingly complicated and suspenseful, bringing to mind classic tales like Shakespeare's Twelfth Night which revolve around the hilarity and complexity of cross dressing. And just as powerful as the funny moments, there are also deeply emotional moments which might elicit a tear from even the most hardened heavy metal rocker. OK, I admit I bawled like a baby twice in  episodes. Stop smirking.The overall presentation is cute and family friendly. But at the same time there are gags that appeal to the adults amongst us. In one episode there's a scene involving the girl using ping pong balls to, how do I say... simulate manhood, and it had me choking with laughter for a solid  minutes.I also must say a word about the actual music. I really like it. It's infectious, played well, and the actors even look like they're really playing their instruments. If you're like me, you might be sick of TV & movies where the actors look like they're holding a limp squid rather than a guitar. Well these actors are good enough to fool me.So there you have it, nothing but high praise from me. I'm already sad that it's going to end, but at the same time I imagine this is the kind of show I'd want to watch over & over. Other band based comedies I highly recommend are Swing Girls (Japanese) about a group of misfits teen girls trying to play jazz, A Mighty Wind about a hilarious bunch of freaks playing folk music, Music & Lyrics starring Hugh Grant & Drew Barrymore with some riotous references to s pop, and the aforementioned mofo of all musical movies, This Is Spinal Tap. See them all, and consider it the best music education you'll ever receive.", "You are Beautiful is a cute  kdrama rom com worth watching.

The twin sister reluctantly takes a break from becoming a nun to support her brother's dream of fame which he believes will make it easier to look for their mystery mother. What I liked: a) Pop band lead Hwang Tae Kyung (Jang Geun Suk) is smart, selfish, blunt, and precise. Great facial expressions! Pig Rabbit was darling. I loved watching this character grow into love and move away from me to we. b) Female lead Go Mi Nam (Park Shin Hye) has her own forthright charm (pig nose when feeling love) but is manipulated due to her love for others and the need to protect. c) Masquerade as a boy is known early to key characters, so the love interests are aware of the situation. This is not Coffee Prince. d) Catchy pop tunes. e) Final declaration of love is satisfying.What I didn't like: a) Villains' manipulations went on too long from the characters Yoo He Yi (Uee) and Tae Kyung's mother (Kim Sung Ryung). I wish these characters had been defanged earlier in the series. b) Go Mi Nam's aunt (Choi Ran) did not appeal to me. I could delete this character. c) Search for the mystery mother got bogged down mid way, it does come to a conclusion. d) Masquerade as a boy could have been resolved earlier, the rationale felt flimsy after mid way in the series.", "You're Beautiful is a story about a woman who gets integrated into an idol group after her twin member becomes indisposed due to an injury.

Does it live into its hype? Yes,it does. The plot alone is reasonable enough to live into it. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST ROMANTIC Asian DRAMAS EVER MADE!!!Although it does have some similarities with another great drama entitled,The First Shop Of The Coffee Prince, the story is fresh, original and one of a  kind. The acting of the cast was good but special mention must be given to both Jang Geun Suk and Uee for their splendid performances as Go Mi Nam Go Mi Nyo and Yo Hi Yee respectively. Finally, the music was simply spectacular. This drama deserves a  out of !!!!! It is one of best dramas ever made. A must see!!!!!", "You're beautiful is the drama that got me into dramas. Its a favorite of mine and I've watched it more than once. The characters in this show are well written and well acted.Go Mi Nyu   Go Mi Nam: Park Shin Hye did a great job acting as Mi  Nyu Though it bothered me greatly how weak the character was in personality. Go Mi Nyu   nam, was quite a nervous wreck for parts of the show but who wouldn't be in that kind of situation? I really loved the chemistry between Mi Nyu and Tae Kyeong. I was in suspense throughout the show wondering when Go Mi nyu's secret was going to be revealed.Hwang Tae Kyeong: Jang Keun Suk is an amazing actor, he pulled off the arrogant, cold, emotionally wounded germophobe leader very well. Tae Keyong has many different phobias like the fear of being touched, fear of the dark. Tae Kyeong can be quite the jerk but hes got some sweet moments too.Jeremy: Lee Hong Ki did a good job as Jeremy the bubbly playful fun loving best friend type of guy in the group. There is never a dull moment with Jeremy on screen. Unfortunately for Jeremy hes not the brightest. Jeremy is a relief during the heavier parts of the drama. Yes there is some kind of heavy parts. Though the drama is balanced out well with emotions.Kang Shin woo: Jung Yong Hwa killed me playing Shin woo. I fell head over heels for his character. Shin woo is a very mature, wise, kind, sweet and caring character always supporting Go Mi Nyu   Nam. The actor does a killer you just kicked a puppy infront of me face the feels from that is just too much for me. He has some pretty killer outfits in the show too. It came as a surprise to me that Jung Yong  Hwa wasn't just a good singer but also a good actor too.You don't really need me to summarize the story again so I'll just give my thoughts instead.Now you may think it would be a pretty teen centered fangirling drama as its a teenage nun in a all male pop band but You're beautiful has its own special charm. Its got a lot of jokes in it but has heartbreaking moments as well. The storyline stays on a straight path, it doesn't go to a giant mess like some dramas I've watched they stay true to their story.I cried a few times with this show, I bawled like a baby at how romantic the last episode was. I ended up shouting at my screen a few times as well even though I know the characters can't hear me. I got so into it that the drama become lodged deep in the depths of my heart and I reacted out loud without realizing half the time.I thought it'd just appeal to fangirls   boy crazy teens when I went to watch it. But I honestly don't think that way after watching it. Its a drama that sucks you in and you want to watch episode after episode.Though there is a bit of fanservice for the girls (mmm shirtless shin woo) I mean what? I said nothing shh don't tell anyone I know.I think if it was us in Mi Nyu's shoes we'd have a hard time picking with how amazing all three guys personalities are. (even though Tae  Kyeong can be a jerk he can win a girls heart when hes not so cold.) Honestly I doubt Mi Nyu could of picked if it was real life and not a show, because they are all wonderful. (I probably would be swayed to shin woo though)This show I think is perfect for lonely people or maybe just me but it lifted my spirits when I was down I think that has got to count for something right?The music in this show is wonderful, the music always fits with the scenes perfectly. When it comes to the actors actually playing instruments it looks real. Well real enough to fool the average person I don't know if it'd fool someone who knows instruments well.Anyway that ends my first IMDb review. Though I'm not good with reviewing stuff at least I tried?This show has a high rating from me and will always be close to my heart.(I put it as contains spoiler because I'm unsure if any of this is even a tiny spoiler)", "A uncommon plot with the setting of the music industry.

First of all, the casts are perfect and I especially love the girl main character.

Sure, they get married very quickly, so if you're looking for a slow built romance, maybe this one isn't for you.

If it's that important why wasn't it tucked away safe inside a folder rather than being waved around while held in hand, and even if it gets lost, it is a paper document after all  a reissue could have been requested later. If that is a plot hole, I've just illustrated one of many. You get my point. Nonetheless, this series (and many others) does make me convinced that if multi universe theory is true then time travel would be a futile attempt anyway, even if it was made possible. With multitude of time lines, it would deem sensible to just live your life to the fullest in the time line that you are in, rather than waste time trying to affect other time lines with inconsequential outcomes.", "First of all, let me state that I was intrigued by the premise. I've always been a fan of time travel, whether it be in movies, TV shows or other. I'm not going to rant about errors vis a vis the time travel blah blah blah, or the logistics of it. After all, it's fantasy, and should be accepted as such. So the writers executives, whoever it was, came up with this great idea for a show. Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there. Someone, in all their wisdom, decides that it must go on for  x   hour episodes. The problem is that, I get the feeling this decision was made long before the knowledge or guarantee, if you like, that the show actually needed those  episodes. So the writers are left with the task of prolonging this fantastic idea to the point where it becomes boring frustrating annoying. I can forgive them for the time travel errors, cause that's just fantasy, but the moronic characters and dialogue, this I cannot. I'm also amazed by the technical abilities of mobile phones in South Korea, apparently, they can pick up dialogue with crisp quality from at least  yards away when shooting video. I wonder if writers will ever stray from the 'cliche' of ending an episode on a cliff hanger, in the vain hope that viewers will just have to watch the next installment. I know, and this may sound radical, but why don't they just concentrate on writing a good script, draw in the viewers, make them sit on the edge of their seat? Not bore them for  minutes then throw a spanner in the works in the final  minutes like some kind of bait.This could have been fantastic as, let's say,  x  hour episodes. I'm guessing at this point, because I reached episode  and concluded that  x  hour shows would have sufficed up til now. I won't be watching anymore, I really tried to give it a fair shot. To say I am disappointed would be an understatement of gargantuan proportions. I've watched other Korean shows (My girlfriend is a gumiho , My love from the star , Master's sun, oh my Venus etc) and found them all to be very enjoyable, or at least, made me watch til the end.

They seemed to be hot tempered so often rival groups of boys and girls were engaged in fighting. The hero was a playboy and the heroine was a female gang leader. At some particular scenes it has portrayed landscape of village which was eye soothing. And the soundtrack was also good. The lead actors and actresses did their best but continuous sanguinary fighting and conflict just for my girl and other tiny issues was not adorable to me. Severe punishment of immorality was also expected. However sometimes this movie managed to uphold teenage psychology which involves the reluctance to follow the straight path and courteous manner for having hot young blood . It's got a subtle similarity with another box office hit Korean movie Sunny ()   both the movie focused on the same period and clashes among hot tempered teenage people yet  Sunny was a movie involving much deeper emotion and friendship. And I believe, most of the teenagers even in today's restless society don't possess such hot blood and they are more considerate in cherishing friendship to lead a better future rather than creating such enmity among them! :) .", "This is a movie that has a little bit of something for everyone. At least to the Korean audiences or people that know of Korean lifestyle and cultures. But it just won't appeal to every audiences. It's basically about the life of few high schooler's during the 's without it having a set direction. It does somewhat come together near the end. But it's a movie that shows what Korean countryside high schoolers dealt with during the 's. And it has a love triangle going on which is the core of the story (which I think a lot of Korean audiences like, since it's a formula that isn't getting old seeing how majority of the Korean dramas are like that), a bit of high school rivalry and bullying going on. It really isn't a gripping movie or anything like that and the story is actually quite slow since there isn't really a set direction. But audiences that want to see high school relationships and how they deal with dysfunctional families might enjoy or at least appreciate this flick. I gotta admit there was few parts that I thought had some emotion and heart to it. And I thought the smooth and clean cinematography of the countryside was refreshing to watch, especially the intro. When it comes to the cast, they were alright. Except the female lead who I thought was a miscast, mainly because I just couldn't buy her being a leader of a high school gang or this tough girl. Lee Jong Suk plays Joong Gil who is this sleazy playboy that tries to be flirtatious with every female classmate. Now I am not a fan of Lee Jong Suk, but I was impressed with his performance in this. I am not sure if it's because he was playing a bit of himself like Justin Timberlake to The Social Network. But the way he portrayed his character was extremely believable to the mannerisms, to the way he says his dialogues to the movements. Overall, it's a worthwhile watch if you want to see a relationship driven movie. But like I said, it probably isn't for everyone..

Sure, it's not one of the best dramas ever to be made, it's not a   rating all over the board and it's not winning any Oscars or awards of that calibre. However, I think there is some real charm within this. The first few episodes are definitely quite cringy, and I definitely considered dropping it after the first  , however, the middle of the series isn't too bad. If you can make it to around episode , then you can pretty much finish this off without it being too cringe. The last couple of episodes   the last one in particular   were extremely well done.

There was a lot where EXO could have done more with their acting, there was a lot where Gayoung could have toned down Inchul Gal a lot more as well.

This isn't to knock the acting at all, don't get me wrong   I think all actors and actresses did really well with what they were given for the show, I think the script and character writing could have just balanced it out a bit more. I keep saying this does have a bit of a cringe factor, and truth is, if the characters had been toned down a notch or toned up a notch then I think that wouldn't have occurred   this is my own personal opinion, I know quite a few people who love it how it is.This is a show that definitely has charms.

When she liked a guy or got embarrassed it turned red...well more like hot pink alien like. That was simply too weird and silly. Plus, the locket thing was really silly as well.

This fake variety show involves her going to live and work with the mother of the guy she's pretend dating, along with said guy, and their extended family.This shows stars Kim Dasom (I don't know what her actress name or real life name is, but she's a member of the idol group Sistar). I am familiar with Sistar and who Dasom is, but this my first exposure to her as an actress. She has participated in two other TV dramas prior to this, but they were both well over  episodes, and I have neither the time nor inclination to watch shows of that length. The first thing you should know about Dasom is that she is SMOKING hot (just like all of her Sistar idol mates). The entire group is built (ahem) to be as sexy as possible, while still trying to exhibit a cute and fun appeal at the same time; go watch some of their music videos and you'll see what I'm referring to. Can Dasom act though?, and, is this show worthwhile?...well, let's find out!As our story begins, Dasom's character (Oh In Young) makes her way to the variety show set (which takes place in a farm home setting which prepares various traditional Korean food & sauces for restaurants & other buyers). This is a place that requires you to work hard and get your hands dirty. In Young, however, loves her high heels and skimpy flashy outfits and she's ill suited for this environment at first. As such, the family she's moved in with disapproves of her right away, but they've agreed to do the show, and if it's well received, their business will prosper (and so will In Young and her idol group & company). Over time, the show becomes popular as In Young fits in a little better, and starts slowly winning over the entire family and their ever discerning family matriarch. And of course, she and her nerdy but handsome fake show love interest costar begin to have actual feelings for each other.You'll immediately notice this show has a pretty low budget. That's OK, but you must compensate for fiscal restraints by having some combination of a good story, solid writing, proper direction, and stellar acting performances. Unfortunately, this show doesn't really do any one of those things very well. You know you're in for some pain and suffering when the first couple of episodes consist mainly of a midriff baring lead having multiple gassy fart problems, followed by the introduction of several stereotypical self centered & annoying Korean cinema mothers, followed by a bunch of mama boys that need to grow up, followed by younger female characters who are searching for self empowerment. YUK!The second thing you'll notice about this show is that it resembles a long running day time Korean soap opera that's been compressed to  episodes and played on fast forward. Almost every scene consists of a one or two minute interaction between one or more cast members, then it's on to the next one or two minute scene. The way it's scripted and framed doesn't help matters either; it consists mainly of a close up shot of Character A reading a single line, then a close up of Character B reading a single line, then repeat some back and forth like this until the end of their short scene. At the end of each scene, someone references or mentions something about a rd party not involved in the current scene. Then, cut away to said rd party having their own short scene, then continue this formula FOREVER until the show eventually concludes.Because of how the scenes are written, there never seems to be any personal interaction or meaningful communication among any of the character. It feels like everyone is just reading lines and nothing more. All of the characters involved are supposed to evolve over time, but it's a very cumbersome & repetitive process along the way; someone accepts someone, then turns their back on them, then accepts them again; this pattern of behavior is repeated often throughout this show between multiple characters, and, it really becomes tedious and just plain absurd as the show drags on. As a result, this show is severely lacking in any depth, and it fails to ever build any suspense, tension, or momentum.The cast does what they're asked, and they mostly do OK (but just barely). There are several insufferable performances though, and no standout ones. The cast's star power and  or acting prowess (or lack thereof) isn't the problem here though; where this show fails clearly lies at the feet of the writers and the director. Good K dramas build towards their climax and include multiple important scenes where you can't take your eyes off the screen, which in turn, engages the viewer to invest in the story, care about its characters, and look forward to the next episode. Sadly, this show doesn't ever accomplish any of this. As far as Dasom's performance goes, she did all right with what she was given to work with. I doubt she'll ever win any best actress awards, but she could likely make a decent living in this field if given the chance to be aligned with shows that have better stories and some decent writing and direction. Until that happens though, she shouldn't quit her day job with Sistar (which she is excellent at)!Summary: Unfortunately, I have to drop the hammer on this show; it's neither interesting nor intelligent nor original. This is clearly a project that was just designed to quickly fill a time slot and nothing more. In short, it has no heart and no soul. Don't waste your time with this.Bottom Line:  out of  stars!...Not recommended!"], "Sentiment Score": 1.0}, "1175": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1192": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "973": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "700": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "619": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1201": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "774": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "208": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "960": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Negative", "Reviews": ["Maybe I should have given it an .\nBut I'll stick with .\nIt has a serial killer in it, but it's not about a serial killer.

The classroom mock trial, the disciplinary council scenes, the classroom rivalry between Hyun Woo and Hong Jung Min,the experiences of law students at Harvard Law School and the development of all the lead characters were great in the first  episodes. Things went downhill when the story transferred to Seoul when expected Korean drama elements took over. When the storyline transferred in Seoul, the environmental case had a lot of promise. Unfortunately, it was underdeveloped. Also,the drama turned into low gear as the LOVE STORY of both Hyun Woo and Soo In became slow and OVER THE TOP in Seoul. Aside from that, the early law career of Hyun Woo become somewhat predictable. Also, the Soo In character in Seoul became somewhat weak as compared to the Soo In at Harvard. The female lead character became weak all of a sudden without any explanation whatsoever. There were also many unrealistic plots that were presented in the second part of the drama when all characters moved from Harvard to Seoul. It was just so disappointing that Love Story At Harvard had the promise to become an unforgettable and classic Korean drama.Unfortunately, this became an ABOVE AVERAGE Korean drama instead of a CLASSIC one. If the writers of the drama become more original and creative, then Love Story At Harvard would have become what My Sassy Girl is as a Korean movie. I was truly disappointed when it did not become one. Despite of my comments previously, I still would highly recommend Love Story At Harvard to anyone who enjoys watching a Korean Drama for the acting in this drama was great.

It's  episodes long family drama and so I've been warned to carefully decide if I want to start such a long journey. For YJH, I think I would.It started out pretty clich\u00e9d, which was expected of many family dramas I've watched. But the reason to stick to the first episode is because for the first time I feel YJH is to be pity. He played a character named Park Hyun soo, the eldest son of the family but was looked down by his family. The reason being is that his mother was kicked out of the house for allegedly having an affair with another man. Other reason would be that he couldn't control his strong headed wife, Yoona (Han Ji hye). Yoona hated Hyun soo for marrying her without love and just for money. Their several confrontations finally lead to Yoona leaving the house.Hyun soo knows that if he ever divorce Yoona, it means that he will lose whatever respect left that his father has for him. While desperate to get Yoona back, Hyun soo met a woman with uncanny resemblance to his wife. That's when he concocted a plan to hire that woman (Mong hee also played by Han Ji hye) as his wife.The drama started fairly well with enough revenge plot, money craving heirs and in laws troubles. But with all the family dramas out there, I Summon You Gold doesn't have anything new to add. The only addition is the identical twin characters and that's not even very original.There are times when I was speechless at the turn of conversations and events. I could laugh because I'm not sure if it was meant to be a joke.Han Ji hye was obviously doing her best and was awarded Top Excellence award at MBC Drama Award but I could feel that YJH was not so comfortable with his character near the end. Glad he did win an award though for the bad script he had to went through.Overall, I gave it a . All on all, it's not an easy thing to produce a drama with  episodes.

It is primarily a mystery thriller with a touch of a fantasy element.SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: A seemingly perfect husband & wife's young child is kidnapped and eventually found dead. The mother is distraught and tries to drown herself, but she fails. When she awakens from her unsuccessful suicide attempt, she finds she has traveled back in time  days prior to her daughter's death. Events from the previous  weeks start repeating themselves, and she soon realizes she better figure out what's going on in order to prevent the future death of her daughter from happening again.The initial premise of the show is set up quite well. It's not clear why this woman was sent back in time or why she's the only one who's aware of the events to come. It is apparently due to God's gift, but this is never fully explained and there are very little religious overtones here. In fact, this time travel plot often gets lost in the scheme of things, except mostly at the beginning of the show, and at the very end; it does pop up occasionally, but this show spends a considerable amount of time focusing on its mystery and thriller elements instead. And surprisingly, there are very few romantic, comedic, or familiar melodramatic aspects to be found at all. It makes sense to not include these standard K drama motifs in a show like this though; after all, what couple really has time for romance and fun with their costars when their daughter is about to be murdered?While I appreciate the effort to avoid typical K drama themes for a change, the absence of these themes does create some problems when you have  hours to fill with nothing but one continuing mystery thriller plot line. As such, this story is often unnecessarily byzantine during its run time; once this show hits its stride, there's a bevy of characters introduced who may or may not be the eventual kidnapper killer, or who may be connected to the crime in some way. Each week it appears they might have finally caught the actual bad guy(s), only to find one more layer of the onion to peel back in next week's episode. The show is good at keeping you guessing who the culprit(s) is are, but this rinse and repeat approach to storytelling does becomes tedious when you have to keep it going for much longer than is really practical.Aside from a few missteps, production values are satisfactory for a K drama for the most part, though there are a few scenes (and one glaring one involving a car skidding out of control) where the editing and CGI departments didn't quite get the job done. There's only so much these departments can do on a TV show though that airs twice weekly.Writing is pretty solid, and the writers did pen an interesting & intricate story that they clearly worked very hard on. You'll have to pay attention in order to start connecting everything together down the stretch run, and this isn't always easy when you're a K drama binge watcher like I am (who also likes to have a few drinks along the way). The story is not really complicated, but I often prefer my K dramas to require as little attention as possible while viewing, and this is a show that really doesn't afford you that opportunity.Acting is mostly solid, but there are a few insufferably annoying characters on this show that will make you want to punch your TV. And as usual, you have to view everybody's performances here under the guise & understanding of how these K dramas roles are typically portrayed. Lee Bo young is fantastic throughout in the lead role of the desperate mom who'll do anything to save her daughter's life. Cho Seung woo is solid as the main costar portraying a washed up cop trying to help Bo young's character & her daughter while also trying to save his retarded brother on death row, heal past wounds, & reconnect with his family. There's various other important starring & or supporting characters that are too numerous to mention in great detail (i.e. Bo young's husband, the police squad leader, various potential bad guys, etc), but, I must give some credit to the   year old girl (Kim Yoo bin) who plays the young daughter; she's tasked with portraying a number of traits and emotions of a typical girl of that age, while acting opposite adults. Her character is also forever getting kidnapped, threatened, and put in harm's way by a host of menacing bad guys; this would seem a bit scary to me if I were a little girl, but Yoo bin just rolls with it all like a pro.And while there is no real humor to speak of, there is one thing (which recurs time and again) that I found particularly amusing; the husband and wife's baffling lapses in remembering that practically everyone in Korea is trying to kidnap & kill their little daughter. They both love and want to protect her, and often go to great lengths to save her, then they just let her wander off again, or leave her in the care of some incompetent weirdo or stranger or someone they know holds a grudge against them. I guess you need some means by which to keep the daughter in continual peril though.Summary: It's pretty good, but it has some faults and probably should've been pared down to the  episode range. I liked it overall, but I would have rated this at least a point lower than I did, if not for how it concluded. You'll have to sit & sift through A LOT in order to get the finish line, so the final payoff better be good when you eventually get there, and it is!Bottom Line: . to  out of  stars. Very Well Recommended (if you can overlook its flaws).", "if you follow Korean dramas you would know that they are pretty much afan girl service stuff and they rarely try anything outside the box when they do they usually flop and that's exactly the case in thisshow...a psychological thriller that with some improvements in the script could be a good movieLee Bo young who is probably the most underrated Korean actress gives her all as a grieving paranoid mother who will do anything and everything for her child and her performance is so realistic and heartbreaking ... the male lead is also solid as the shady detective who keeps you guessing all the way ...the acting and the interesting idea and solid production makes you forgive the obvious holes in the script and the way the writer treated the characters the ending upset about % of the fans but viewed objectively its a logical ending but should been done more proficiently but again thats what happens when you have to shoot the drama live.  for acting and ambition"], "Sentiment Score": 1.0}, "1428": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["This is a good drama recommended for ladies and young people as the show is about a persistent person who never give up, despite one obstacles after another. I have recommended to my son and daughter to watch. The plot revolves around how a common girl could work in a palace as a palace girl, be bullied and because she was determined to learn, she overcame all odds to be the top of her palace girl career, but was derailed by many political opponents. Although framed, she came back via a different career path as a female doctor. All throughout her struggles, it was her reminders from her mentors that made her succeed, and on the verge of giving up, motivated her to try harder. As I watch the drama, it reminded me of the way corporate world works where competition will prevent you from moving up. This story has many plots and subplots, love and romance, and sacrifices. There are also funny moments acted out by Jang Geum's foster parents. As the story unfurled, I learned many things about taking care of one's health and traditional Chinese (in this case, Korean) medicine, and about healthy cooking. It also gave me insight into how medicine works. Recommend that you watch the Korean dialog version,with English subtitles, or Chinese subtitles, as it gives you the emotions from the Korean dialog and insinuations.", "This is a popular Korean historical drama based loosely on a real life woman who became the King's personal physician. This was during a time when Confucian rules were extremely strict and patriarchal, so it was very unusual for a woman to attain such a high position. The show's writers used the bare historical framework available and heavily embellished it to construct a wonderful drama.Jang geum is the daughter of fugitives; she is orphaned at an early age. She enters the royal palace as a palace maid, and begins training to be come a court lady under the tutelage of Lady Han. However, the palace is rife with the machinations of the evil Lady Choi, until Jang geum and her mentor are finally sent into exile. Jang geum finds another career path and is able to re enter the palace as a physician lady. Of course, there is a love interest: the handsome and noble Sir Min who unconditionally supports Jang geum's career ambitions at his own expense. Women figure prominently both as plotting against Jang geum and helping her. There are a few touches that remind one of a Gothic novel, such as the occasional vision of those who have passed away.This is a wonderfully compelling show full of lovely costumes, sets, scenery, cinematography. The makers obviously set out to show Korea in all its beauty and miss no opportunity to place a mountain in the background. I believe real palaces were used in some of the shots, and these are beautiful as well.The show is also rather wholesome, and I mean that in the best sense possible. The virtuous heroine is eventually rewarded for her good character   her courage, loyalty, strong work ethic, desire to help others. There are absolutely no sex scenes or revealing clothes   a bare foot seen for one second is as suggestive as it gets. In this day and age it's refreshing to see a TV drama that can be wholesome without being sappy. Somehow, Jang geum and Sir Min's long romance is the more beautiful because they aren't allowed to Be Together.Anyone who has enjoyed Jane Austen adaptations, Gothic novels, and other story lines with a long suffering heroine struggling with class prejudice, sexism and the plots of other women will certainly enjoy this. As long as you don't mind subtitles and can find a subtitled version, you'll be fine. The Chicago Korean TV station aired this with subtitles, and Yesasia is promising to release an English subtitled DVD set later on this year. Google Jang geum forum to find English speaking forums that will answer a lot of your questions regarding the show.Seek this out, it's a hidden treasure.", "This is the first time I have written a comment on IMDb in all the years I have used it avidly to search for worthy videos to watch. I am writing it not because there is not enough comments already for this wonderful series, but to additionally help you decide if you should invest a whopping  hours of your life on watching one drama! Since this is aimed at convincing you why you should watch it, I will keep spoilers to a minimum.So how did I get involved with it? I was searching for worthy Korean TV series to watch after having seen the more contemporary setting drama such as Stairway To Heaven, which is highly recommended. When I came across this, although rated highly by others, I shy ed away from it for the same reason above ... I just couldn't imagine how this kind of drama can entice me. But...someone I know asked if I have it to lent them due to the fact I told people I watched Korean Drams. I did not in spite of my collection of top DVD titles. I decided to get it just to find out what it was all about. At the time, IMDb did not have this title rated to assist in my decision.Episode one was interesting. Not hooked but enough interest to keep me going...same with the next one...and then when I finally got to the part when the little Jang Geum became orphaned and out shone the other little girls in the palace in her determination and diligence, that is when I really got hooked, which brings me to a suggestion ... watch the first  episodes in their entirety. If you are still only on the sideline not sure to continue or not after watching episode , then you should probably stop watching (really unthinkable to me but I suppose it is possible). The actors actresses are handsome pretty, but that is not why I continued.The first set of DVDs I purchased was made in China and had OK English translation. The problem with the English translation, while subtle, surfaced more in the second half, as one can tell they are not done by the same person(s). An anal movie buff that I am, I sold it and bought the YesAsia edition, more expensive but has much better translation (a very prominent example would be: Palace Girl in the China Edition is Court Lady in the YesAsia edition    while Palace Girl is the literal translation, the proper equivalent by title is Court Lady). The picture quality is also better. In fact, my wife commented that Jang Geum (grown up) is not as pretty as in the China version now that she can see the imperfections on her face close up.... So I ended up spending yet another  hours re watching...but it was worth it...because the translation clarified things that otherwise would have been lost as cultural differences. This is the set that will remain in my library as one of the rare worthy TV dramas to collect in its original form. By the way, the China edition in the green box has bonus materials of interview with some of the cast members as well as the last  days of filming    even though there is no English subtitle on the bonus materials, it was still quite enjoyable to see how the cast looked in modern attire and their reaction to the questions! :)With so many TV programs trying to buy an audience with sex, violence, and improper language (lack of respect) screen time nowadays, it is truly refreshing to see something that not only serves to entertain but also educate at the same time without emphasis on sex and violence! It is little wonder that this series has swept away audiences all over and realigned some of the younger generation to the ideals that seem to be eroding away in the modern world.In closing, none of the episodes disappointed and they were all enjoyable, but it is just a small few minutes here and there of extra details that seem to drag a bit in the first  episodes. In fact, I have a feeling that if you are KOREAN you will probably not feel the drag due to your ability to relate those details better than non KOREANs like me.The quality of research that has gone into making this production (the cuisines and the medicines) is impressive and educational. The music   excellent. Combined with the singular vision of one director and one writer for this drama, it is a COMPLETE experience that, in short, will enrich the lives of anyone who is open minded and willing to invest the time to watch it.Please let me know if my comment is helpful to you.

From then on, it had got me intrigued.Based on the life of the first ever woman royal physician in the now Korea, it will definitely pull your heartstrings and move you. The age old philosophy of perseverance and facing whatever adversaries no matter how big or small is dominant in this drama serial.Lee Young Ae plays the role of Jang Geum very well. So do the other cast members as well. Those who play the evil court ladies are really so convincing that it made me forgot for a moment that it is only just a show.The spread of food being shown in the drama serial can really make you go mouth watering. You will be surprised as to why each dish has its own significance and all that. The medical knowledge that Jang Geum has later on in the serial is really impressive but then at times, it got her into trouble as well. But she always persevered and save the day. The scenes with Lord Min are always very sweet and romantic.In this current age and times where the traits Jang Geum possesses really make people try to understand more of the world they are in, this show is definitely a winner. Virtually almost no sex is involved here and this is something Asian societies has been waiting for a long time, given our culture can be conservative at times. But as long as anyone is interested in checking out this drama serial, you need to find out first whether there's dubbing and or subtitles involved if your local TV station is showing it. Chances are there will be, given the original language is in Korean.

Very inspiring for its central moral drama, it is also full of great incidental historical and cultural information. The lead, Yeong ae Lee, as Jang geum, is a fine, subtle actress; here's hoping she will appear in more films. Since she apparently was part of the jury at  Berlin Film Festival she should have a wider world cinema audience. Also, the English subtitles are exceptionally well done, but I regret that they don't give English language production information.

Luckily, this show is the one that makes the public fall in love more and more after each of its episode.\nInstead of the serious, bleak, and depressing atmosphere that recent South Korean police or detective series such as Signal or Secret Forest, Live is very refreshing, heart warming, and realistic.

Then I went back and binge watched the entire series a second time. This show is simply that good. I didn't want it to end. The show follows the lives of the members of local police station as they deal with issues while on duty and in their everyday lives. The stories are very well developed and the acting is excellent. As the show progresses, the characters grow in depth and you find yourself becoming emotionally attached to them and caring about their outcomes. But be warned, there are some gut wrenching moments in this show and there were several times I was brought to tears.As other reviewers have stated, this show needs a season ."], "Sentiment Score": 0.5077777777777777}, "710": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1352": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1359": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["If you ever watched Marrying the Mafia, a Korean Hit Movie, you will love this.

Both the actors bring fierce intensity to their roles with their well acted scenes and show such emotion through their lines, looks and even their stares.

For every episode I was overtaken by the aesthetics of the show.The show is also a subject of interest for history buffs. As Westerners watching the show, Korean history is probably the last thing we would be interested by. It is interesting to see how the show portrays adapting Korean people and how foreign involvements in Korea during the period played out. Also, the main character features a Korean American Marine Corps captain. Sounds far fetched? Surprisingly not, I have found. And, of course, the romance. I should not say too much, but I will say that the show will make you cheer for the male and female leads. In sum, this show offers no other show has to the greater international audience.

With a budget in excess of  billion won ( million USD), it, along with its spin off Athena: Goddess of War, share the record for the most expensive Korean dramas ever produced. Premiering in October , the series was a critical and commercial success, with an average viewership of over % in addition to ranking as the top program consistently every week after its debut. The series also took home many of the highest honors at the  KBS Drama Acting Awards, including Byung hun Lee winning the top recognition, the Daesang Award. Among other nominations and recognitions, Lee and Tae hee Kim were also named as one of the best on screen couples. My Review In One Breath: This series ( episodes,  minutes each) concerns a National Security System agent who attempts to take down a secret organization. After the introductory opening episodes, the missions are similar to what one would find in the American  series (excluding the real time element), with agents attempting to stop terrorist attacks with the use of satellites and information support technicians. Of course, this is in the Korean style with some romance and melodrama blended in. Acting is top notch, with Byung hun Lee in the lead role and a very good supporting cast: Tae hee Kim (his love interest and fellow agent), Seung woo Kim (a North Korean agent) and So yeon Kim (as the gorgeous North Korean sniper). Production values are slick, the scoring is great at times, and the pacing is very fast for a K drama with plenty of shootouts (a few of which are fantastic) and suspense. Storyline is clich\u00e9d but the secret organization is intriguing and represents a brilliant little twist on the North South Korean conflict. Consequently, the relationships between the characters change significantly in exciting ways and the viewer will have an emotional investment in the protagonists. Highly addictive stuff.", "NOTE: This review has been edited as of   .Iris is  episode Korean TV show that aired in . It's your basic Korean melodramatic TV series format, only it's infused with a significant amount of action & intrigue. Iris  (Iris II, Iris; New Generation) is its second follow up season, which was also  episodes, but it didn't air until .SPOILERS AHEAD!I had originally written  separate reviews years ago for this show series, because IMDB originally listed them as  different shows. Since then, IMDB has apparently merged the original Iris page and the Iris  page together, so I'll do my best to merge my two original reviews together here under one review for both shows seasons.Iris (Season ) was a unique show in Korea when it aired. The idea behind it, was to get some guys who like action spy intrigue flicks to also tune into a TV genre almost exclusively geared to attracting female viewers by nature. They spent a fortune making this show (by KTV standards at the time), and it shows; production values are through the roof, various exotic locales are visited, there's some terrific cinematography, blazing gunfights, action scenes, etc.Viewers loved it immediately (as did I), and it's easy to see why; it's often a riveting television series that is hard to look away from! And, Judging by the show's super high nationwide ratings (nearly % of all Korean TV viewers were watching this show by the time it wrapped up), I'd say the producers accomplished their goal and then some. Iris was a massive success by KTV standards that soon spawned a spin off show (Athena), a movie (which was just an edited version of the TV show), talks of a second season (which only rarely happens in this medium), and so forth.The closest comparison to this show for western audiences is the American TV series , and that's a fair analogy, as they do share many similarities. Here's your story: Two marine friends get recruited by the NIS (basically the South Korean equivalent of the U.S. CIA NSA). While there, they meet the primary love interest who is their section chief responsible for training them. The  friends quickly take to their new jobs as secret agents, and are soon deployed in the field. Things go wrong when they are sent on an important mission though, and they discover they're mere pawns in a much bigger picture.After the botched mission by the  friends leads, this show boils down to a matter of uncovering what everybody's motives are, who's working for whom, and trying to stop the world from blowing up. Along the way, there's your main love interest story line, the main friendship story line, and so forth.What cannot be understated is that this show is, at its core, a soap opera. It's a high octane soap opera indeed, but a soap opera nonetheless. I've seen a ton of Korean melodrama shows series over the years, some of which tried their best to have these soap operas reach an audience that includes EVERYBODY (males females, Koreans foreigners, action fans love story fans, etc.), and this is one of those rare shows that actually accomplishes this fairly well.Iris (Season ) is very entertaining and highly watchable. I gave it  out of  stars in my initial rating, and I stand by that.\n \nAs for Iris  (i.e. Season ). Very disappointing for several reasons. I see some reviewers think it's better than the original, however they are wrong, and I'll now explain why: Iris  is greatly hampered by two overriding factors: ) It's just more of the same with a weaker story and less prominent actors, and, ) The show producers missed the window to capitalize on the popularity of the original show st season, by delaying its production for nearly  years.Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of the actors actresses in Season , and they performed well overall, but the story and writing is lacking in general compared to the first season. In addition, everything seems rushed and tacked on (and or poorly thought out), in what appears to be a last ditch effort to just cobble something together to put on TV and bring this show series to a close. Part of the problem is because there was a bunch of hemming and hawing FOREVER about how to write and budget for a new season, along with trying to negotiate and sign up much of the original cast (despite the fact that, SPOILERS, most of their characters died or were disappeared at the end of the original show), and so on. As a result, Iris season  turned out to be a hodgepodge mess that was just too lacking, too little, too late. There are a couple of cast members in Iris  that are back from the original, but they're mostly all supporting roles that are non essential and or are under utilized. There's also several new tie in characters related to characters from the st season, but none of these prior cast members or new related characters really fit well within the overall story. And, I cannot forgive the fact that they cast some English speaking dude as the main evil guy. No offense to him as an actor or person, and I understand they're trying to be more globally receptive by speaking English some, but this role should have been given to someone fluent in Korean; the resulting forced English dialogue between him and some of the Korean actors actresses is often distracting, and prevents the Korean actors actresses from acting at their best (since they have to use a foreign second language in some crucial scenes with him).Iris  (Iris, Season ) is not very good when compared to its forerunner. I originally gave it  out of  stars, and I stand by that. Bottom Line:  out of  stars (for Iris  ONLY). As for Iris , hmmm, watch Athena; Goddess of War instead!", "Iris was a serious South Korean spy thriller, with interesting plot twists, engaging performances, and several brutal betrayals, culminating in a finish that resulted in more than a few questions remaining unanswered. Promising to answer some of questions raised, Iris  is a show that had enormous shoes to fill, and unfortunately, its feet do not match the ambitious size of the original. Though one might imagine the sheer number of story lines would make for a wealth of material, several aspects of the plot are tirelessly dragged out, obviously in the show's desperate attempt to reach  hour long episodes. Often predictable, with minimal character back story, and a plot held together at the seams with sticky tape, the conflicting and often contradictory story lines risk the production falling apart at a moment's notice.However, if you look past the flaws, there are a number of notable reasons why this show deserves a look, not least of all, the poignancy that is efficaciously delivered by the writers, alongside the talented (and VERY attractive) actors. This is heightened by the amazing musical score, including the gorgeous song from Davichi. Several of the fight sequences are sure to impress, though at the same time, those familiar with the aforementioned original, or even Athena, will see a great number of similarities, alongside the addendum that their frenetic orchestration can make them hard to follow.Furthermore, though some of the dialogue could be accused of immaturity, the chemistry and interactions between the characters prove to be engaging in themselves, the romantic and familial relationships being conceived with much emotion, while some of the witticisms are especially enjoyable. Though the show is often unrealistic, with characters severely injured in one episode, and running around during the next, alongside contradictions in the story lines, and ideas that fail to be fleshed out, Iris  gradually finds its footing towards the end, resulting in an emotionally powerful and worth while finale.Jung Yoo Gun (Jang Hyuk) and paramour Ji Soo Yeon (Lee Da Hae) work together for the NSS, under the authority of deputy director Choi Min (Oh Yeon Su), who is determined to rid the world of Iris. Her goals however, are continuously been undermined by the ambitious Kang Cheol Hwan (Kam Il Woo), who seeks control of the agency, though his allegiances are unclear. When an Iris cell, led by Rey (David McInnis), storms the NSS prison housing the agency's former director Baek San (Kim Young Chul), and extricates him in an attempt to garner much needed information, it becomes clear that Baek San has an important role to play in the war against the terrorist group. When North Korean traitor Yoo Joong Woo (Lee Beom Soo), a man desperate to clear his name, is recruited by Iris agent Kim Yeon Hwa (Lim Soo Hyang) to assist with her mission, tensions between the North and the South begin to escalate, and threaten the inevitable commencement of a unification war.With the sheer number of cast members, it is no surprise that some are provided significantly less screen time than others, with fellow NSS agents See Hyun Woo (Yoon Doo Joon) and Yoon Shi Hyuk (Lee Joon), alongside Iris operative Park Tae Hee (Yoon So Yi), being difficult to associate with due to the significantly lacking characterization. Set over the course of more than a year, Iris  includes not only locations throughout South Korea, but internationally as well, which involve a car chase through the streets of Hungary, and a chase sequence on the ski slopes of Japan. When in its home nation, the shoot outs often occur in warehouses, amongst other abandoned and condemned locations, which offer little in the way of uniqueness.Moving on, it's a fact, in every production, the antagonist is defeated. However, what's most important is not only how, but what horrors they have in store for the heroes. In short, how impressive a villain are they? The monotonous repetition of failure that consumes the enemy organization with every turn they take however, only makes their defeat all the more inevitable. To add insult to injury, the enemy group, Iris, have no motive or agenda, and without a cause, the audience is unable to connect with them on any level. If ever a cause was mentioned, it must have been whispered, for this viewer certainly never heard it.The lacking interest in the terrorist cell is heightened by the show's inability to continuously hold us in suspense. Even the threat of a third world war, despite the emotional performances by the actors, flat lines in its ability to make us legitimately believe this may in fact come to fruition. However, where the show excels, is its ability to captivate the audience with its character relationships. Unlike American shows, that often drag out romances to the point of utter boredom, Iris  gives its viewers enough tension, poignancy, grief and hope, to keep us entrenched for the entirety of the season. Moreover, though antagonists are loathed by the audience at times, on other occasions, they are equally sympathetic. Although the acting could occasionally be accused of being a little too melodramatic, one cannot ever deny the potency, with more than a few moments having the capacity to bring a tear, or more.In conclusion, Iris  is best watched in moderation, and despite the occasional complexity of the stories, the show is very easy to follow. Despite been an enjoyable experience, Iris  is not a show that will cause you to continuously reminisce over the story lines or characters. The show's conclusion leaves the Iris franchise open for a sequel, with a number of plots left unresolved, and several character stories requiring a more definitive close, though whether a third installment will occur, remains to be seen.", "A stunning miniseries from South Korea about the 'NSS' (the South Korean Secret Service). Pardon me if I struggle with the character (or actor) names, but several performances are quite stunning. Character development and  relationships are superb, irony occurs frequently, and there's plenty of action to match the slower sweet scenes showing the developing love story between Choi Seung Hee, the pretty female Service leader, and Kim Hyun Jun, a stud recruit to the spy service. Talk about star crossed lovers! They get separated, find each other, and then lose track of the existence of each other for months, but only after some very near connections. It's one of those: 'HEY! HEY! Look to your right   she's still alive... HEY! HEY.. Oh No..!' Unexpected sentimental stuff when you are are watching a cold hearted spy & intrigue show.IRIS also features a 'cross over' character {that's a term I invented, by the way, so credit me if you use it!}: a character who switches sides, for some reason, to aid the protagonist. Example: the cowboy who breaks free from the wealthy townfolk in 'SHANE' and rides out to warn SHANE about the pending ambush. In IRIS, it's a pretty North Korean agent who falls out of favor with her bosses, and joins Hyun Jun in his quest to get to the bottom of this IRIS conspiracy (after a few attempts to kill him, of course).Also in the show is one of those super assassin types, whose imminent presence is signaled by the camera focusing on his distinctive cowboy boots. Lots of fist fights and shoot em ups to go with some well staged car chases. Plenty of double crosses and plot twists. It has everything U.S. network primetime action shows DON'T have. Like I said, run    don't walk   to tune this thing in. I am writing this in early December: if you have down time this month, add IRIS to the mini series that will dominate your time, instead of clearing snow.", "After watching this one, I felt like that all of James Bond movies are rubbish. Both either its casting or its stories quality! I herewith highly recommend IMDb's audience to watch it and understand its story line, then you'll understand why I wrote this.

It could it even be used as a framework for how to create an entertaining drama. It has great acting, great pacing, great writing, great chemistry between actors and great costumes. Even though King's Daughter, Soo Baek Hyang did not have the most ravish sets nor a high budget it was able to do more than most fancy sageuks have done in the past. I was most impressed with the acting in this drama. It was well cast with some veteran sageuk actors and newcomers to the genre. The lead actress Hyeon jin Seo and actress Woo Seo were spectacular and nuanced in their performance. The most soulful performances were by the veteran actors Jae ryong Lee as King Moo Ryung and Tae young Yoon as Koo Chun. King's Daughter, Soo Baek Hyang had great pacing. The episodes were about  minutes each. The story did not drag on as some other dramas of this genre the wars were short and the torture scenes were brief. The light comedic scenes also made the show very enjoyable to watch. A viewer would never become bored if other dramas of this genre added some light comedy as well.Great writing was also very much present in King's Daughter, Soo Baek Hyang. It used many literary foils effectively. It's quite obvious that kind hearted Seol Nan is the protagonist and her sister Seol Hee is the evil foil. As for the two princes who were switched, here is the other obvious literary foil. The upright yet dashing Prince Myung Nong's foil is Prince Jin Moo who is charming but devilish. Great chemistry between Seol Nan and Myung Nong was another bonus to this drama. They had one of the best romances in Korean dramas. Scenes between Seol Nan and Myung Nong were funny, sweet and sad at the same time. Koo Chun's love for Chae Hwa was also very tender and heartfelt.", "Where we are taken in a journey over an old story of Korea,were we can find how tricky's a person sometimes,how tricky is his knowledge, how can be someone a fool in his conviction;so many pains resulting.Luckily in plot we have Solnan,this kind of girl by a beloved naivety,she's royal bone but she will doesn't know along dozen of episodes.Near her is her half sister Solhia,an devilish,exasperating person who's struggles for status;but on screen she is a terrible actress, she performs extraordinary. I love the character Solnan exactly for her charming naivety and gentle demeanor.She can make you pull the hair for all her credulousness,later all turns in great scenes of retrievals and encounters.She will make you cry at that episode when she'll discover the buried secret of her mother;she will make you laugh,truly,at point that appear in disguise;will delight you with pleasant night scenes at her innocent love meetings with Myungnang. I love many characters of this drama: Doltae for jokes,Muryeong's gently warm,teacher's Dorim gentle wisdom,funnily Queen,sadly Kochon,trustworthy MyungNang and pitied Jinmu,eunuch's Jung amazing kind.... Perfect timed great music at particular scenes.Never bored to see especially Solnan playing her role in specific episodes;her saga provoked me to appreciate the marvelous MBC's studios via internet.", "I watched it because I had nothing else to watch. I'm a big fan of historical Korean drama. Well, first of all, it is so sad you'll cry a river. It contains tragic love story that'll make you cry so hard. The power of this drama is not in the plot twist, but in how long the secrets will be unveiled. As a watcher, we know all the secrets but we are dying to know how much longer will everything revealed. That's the climax. At first, the plot is going a little bit slow but still enjoyable. Try to enjoy it as much as you can until you can do nothing but to skip some parts just to see how and when the secrets are revealed. I hate Seolhee so much that I need to skip most of her parts when Seolnan is not there. I don't think her part bring any importance to the plot either. She's just an evil and selfish girl who think of nothing but herself. I've never hated someone so much before. They are success in making someone looks so bad if the character were alive we could kill her.I couldn't wait any longer to find out how the king would know Seolnan is her daughter so I must skip lots and lots of part in the last episodes. I was disappointed because the king found his real daughter when he's going to die and he did nothing much for her, like, Su Baek hyang has done A LOT for the country, even to the extent of risking her life. And it doesn't seem so rewarding. The end is not satisfying too. Seolnan made a perfect material to become the queen of Baekje but in the end, she doesn't even marry the crown prince. Even though they're allowed to. So... for me, personally it's enjoyable in the beginning toward the end, but you'll rush the episodes because you REALLY want to see how everything's revealed and how the bad guys ruined themselves.

Meanwhile, Han Ji Soo (Young Ae Kim), who is the mother of his last victim, seeks revenge with her family and friends. The owner of a sensationalist television network invites Lee Du sok and Detective Choi for a debate live. Out of the blue, a man with the alias J calls the TV during the debate and tells that he is the real killer and Lee Du sok is a fraud. Who should be the real killer?Nae ga sal in beom i da, a.k.a. Confession of Murder, is an engaging South Korean thriller with a great story. The performances are top notch but the main twist is predictable and explains the behavior of Choi, despite surprising many viewers. There is also a criticism to the behavior of the media and public in general, worshipping a serial  killer because he is handsome. The only remark is the excessive and exaggerated action scenes; however they are part of the entertainment. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Confiss\u00e3o de Assassinato (Confession of Murder)", "This movie was a strange mix of cartoon funny, thriller, noir and drama, all packed in an adventure.There are some twists you don't see coming, and when they do, they come down pouring. Some may find them predictable but considering the pacing of the movie I do not deem most of them predictable, except the first one, and this is not actually good all because of timing. Since I do not intend to share any spoiler here, it will be hard for me to explain my point of view, but I will give it a try: The movie twist bombs you during a single scene of confrontation up until which you had time to dwell on possibilities but wouldn't, in my case at least, because I was too busy savoring the rich performances, an already gruesome and captivating story, and even if I saw a twist coming and try to wrap my head around it, it was hard for me to let the next twist sink in amid all the empathy the story and some of the performances forced me to experience. The shockers in this movie are serious in content and this crowd of twists causes a desensitization in the viewer that doesn't let the whole thing sink in. Where there could be a punch, these are like successive little slaps in your face.I find the cartoonishly unrealistic scenes in the movie to be a treat. It was nice to watch but it also had a function: it gave a glimpse of the new characters that were introduced, the way a caricature does.The social commentary is where the perfectly executed noir steps in. A great satire to public perception of psychopathy and how it is engineered by media. Might give some insight to those clueless people out there who haven't yet realized how we transitioned from denouncing behavior that exudes lack of empathy to glamorizing it, condoning the criminals it breeds, because, you know as well as I do how much we are attracted to people in Wall Street as they speculate and kill our future with a single phone call because of all that sexy hair and slick outfit and their intelligence. Well, there is no high functioning psycho in the movie, but the commentary nails it nonetheless.It is the pacing of the later twists with respect to twist content that led me to give this one an . The punch vs slap thing, in other words.It is a great thriller tainted with abundance of stuff at the cost of more important stuff. The actors in this movie did a great job and character development could have been much better had the script allowed room for it. Come to think of it, this movie should have been at least half an hour longer. As it is, it feels like they crammed it all in . hour so as not to cut it short.If you are binge thriller watchers, watch this one. It is a nice Korean thriller by all means. If you look for more in a movie, then I think it is still worth to give a shot. My guess is that you will be both delighted and disappointed but you will be nowhere near what did I just watch?. No. This one's better than that.", "I don't know exactly where to start. What I do know, is that the movie is incredible! Korean cinema has brought a lot of talent forward and they have made some incredible movies over the last   years. This just continues in that same line. Don't get me wrong, not every movie from Korea is phenomenal. But this one (that will clearly get a US remake sometime soon) has to be in the category of the great ones.I don't want to spoil too much (the title does give you a hint, where this movie is taking you), but you will get more than just a question about morality here. There's also entertainment and suspense and a subplot that works pretty well. You might not understand some character motivations while watching it, but you will get it eventually.I guess there is only one minor thing that you might be able to complain about. It's the fact that the movie could have ended a bit earlier. It seems that they stretched the ending. I still liked it, but I can see why people would have wanted it to end   minutes earlier, when all is said and done (though as it turns out, not everything had been done)", "The bad: Really highly improbable car stunt and other action scenes that had the likelihood and ludicrousness of comic book writing. People jumping from rooftops; out of moving vehicles onto hospital gurneys or tops of other cars while fighting as if no more dangerous than on a kitchen table top, etc. I wasn't sure if it was meant to be spoofing movies that go cheaply overboard in that direction, or not. Decided not, that they were serious. A sadly laughable distraction that lessened the intelligence of the storyline.

The film has a lot of depth as it deals with the topics of friendship, life and trust in a gripping way. The two main characters are authentic, dynamic and sympathetic and most viewers will care about their fates until the very end. The camera work is accurate and slow, the light techniques add a lot of atmosphere, the Locations are mysterious and original, the soundtrack underlines the movie's atmospheric parts and even the special effects are gorgeous yet down to earth which is a perfect mixture most Asian fantasy movies fail to achieve.The story revolves around the friendship of two young outsiders that most viewers might identify with because they are both profound, sympathetic and resilient. Su rin is a teenage girl whose divorced mother died and who has moved to an island with her stepfather. She doesn't really get a long with her busy stepfather, fails to make new friends and is often seen as weird because of her interest in the occult. She's a creative, emotional and smart Girl who even develops a secret sign language. Sung min is a joyful, optimistic and quirky orphan boy who has a crush on the mysterious girl that is so different from all the others. He works very hard to get closer to her and gradually develops an intense friendship and even romantic relationship to the older Girl despite his friends' negative comments. One day, the young couple and two teenage friends discover a mysterious cave in a forest where they find a shining egg in a hidden lake. When Su rin returns to the cave to look for a lost hairpin, the three boys break the mysterious egg and provoke a supernatural event that will have immediate, short term and long term consequences for everyone involved as well as for their families and the island's small community. Telling you anything more would take away from the creative plot.While the event that kicks the story off is a supernatural one, the rest of the story is particularly realistic and has a strong emotional, philosophical and psychological touch. Heart breaking moments and thoughtful passages meet brief moments of hope and joy. The story remains interesting until the end that some might see as a happy and others as a sad ending which makes it even more interesting depending on your point of view.Vanishing Time: A Boy Who Returned is a particularly great movie for intellectual teenagers because of the two brilliant main characters but anyone who likes profound dramas or thoughtful fantasy movies should give this clever film a fair chance.

Ended up staying up very late to watch the entire thing as the film just sucked me right in with it.I'm a big lover of South Korean cinema and surprised this one slipped by me, especially as it was released in , a standout year for Korean cinema.

I've already praised highlighting all the best stuffs. One thing they lack is the awards winning capability, like perhaps the Oscars. Cinematically and entertainment perspective, they always give a top notch product. Particularly, the kind of emotions they use, is very closely appeals to my culture, probably for the rest of the world as well. All I have heard about this was a fantasy film. Beyond that, it was a little romance, a little emotional and a little thriller.There are a large number of people outside the South Korea follow the Korean films. Though this one is definitely an under noticed a great piece of work. I don't know this director, but he wrote and made it pretty awesomely. This kind of tale very much suitable for anime. It's going to be just like another 'Your Name'. If they decide to make it with the small changes, I'm absolutely on to it.The title is not really enchanting for a fantasy film. But definitely makes sense on what it narrates. This is a fantasy film, though, since time involved in it, it automatically a small part of science fiction too. They had well covered all the loopholes and flaws. They did not detail out all minute things, but if you think little intelligently, you will get all the answers for your doubts. For instance, how that asthma boy had died.From a small Korean island town, the story followed a teenage girl, Soo rin who recently moved in there with her stepfather. She was considered a weirdo in the school for being lonely. Then a boy named Sung min befriends her and become girlfriend boyfriend. One day they along with two other boys venturing to the nearby mountain forest, discovered a glowing object. In the next minute, everything has changed. All of them disappeared, except the girl.

Without any options to solve it, where the remaining narration heads and ends were told quite nicely, emotionally.The story was simple, but the details makes is more complex. Easy to follow, there's always an explanation for everything you see. Contents wise, it is a well balanced for children's and the grown  ups viewing. Whenever a film theme involved messing with time, it has to be very clever. Because time naturally does not exist in the universe. It is the human's creation to understand everything's existence. I think they have designed this story with the characters so well. It could be a time travel theme too, if you take it from a different perspective.Two hours long film, but that did not bother me. Because I well merged with the story. The twist came early itself as the storytelling demanded it. But there were many turns in the later parts. Especially the entire second half is less excitement if you are a fantasy film fan. Though it gets tense for every scene, and creates curiosity about the conclusion. Not the best ending, yet very suitable one. What I am impressed with it was how smartly they used the graphics. They did not require higher end. Simple and believable visuals, compared to Hollywood's similar style flicks. One such interesting fact was, they wanted the story to lead the film than the colourful graphics.Nice performances. The locations were good too. There are some moments that reminds other films. Nothing like it stole from them, though for the similarity in the thematic and the situations. The overall film theme was not out and out fresh. It simply changed a few rules and with the kind of development, it created its own identity. As for me, this is one of the top ten fantasy films of the decade and top ten in all time Korean fantasy film. As I said, if you love this genre, then it is a must see. Highly recommended!

I could easily place this movie as a romance   in the end, it depicts what sacrifice one would make in order to save his loved one. Very good story telling, not a moment of dullness and really engaged you into the story till the end. Time is indeed the most precious and valuable asset we all have.", "(spoilers) Korean film Vanishing Time: A Boy Who Returned (Korean translated), was a great watch on a recent plane ride for me   probably the best off all the movies watched during the ride. Director Tae Hwa Eom has put together a well done and tender drama ribboned with fantasy and a bit of science fiction. The movie excels on the strength of its main child actors especially Eun Soo Shin, and although it follows some of the concepts of Big and Vice Versa it is obviously more contemporary than those earlier American films. Editing and cinematography are competent. The filmmakers spend the extra needed time developing lead characters to give the us roots and investment in the characters and then takes off into fantasy.

In addition to him, the team is also made up of three others\u2014the detective Hwang Soon bum, rookie prosecutor Yoo Jung in and an intern, Choi Dong  man. These folks are a nice addition and the ensemble cast reminds me so much of the Law & Order franchise\u2014as does the way the cases are investigated and prosecuted. And, the heavy use of forensics in the show is like seeing an installment of CSI.Now you'd THINK that the show might be a bit like Twilight or Dracula but it's really like neither. This vampire does NOT sleep in coffins nor does he attack folks nor does he avoid the daylight like 'ol Drac but he also is NOT a sparkly, angst ridden guy \u00e0 la Twilight! He's unique and quite professional\u2014a lawyer through and through. Plus, now that I think about it, how different are vampires from lawyers anyways? They both are blood suckers!If all this isn't enough, the show is very well made. It's incredibly stylish, well written and kept my interest. If you like the shows I mentioned above or are really into Asian cinema, it certainly is well worth your time seeking out this unusual show. Finding it isn't easy. The season  DVDs are, oddly, $ on Amazon! And, only season two is on Netflix (wow\u0085that's really helpful!!). Fortunately, it IS available through Hulu and Hulu Plus\u2014and might just make it worth subscribing to the service.", "In , Vampire Prosecutor surprised many with its rather unique story of a man who became a vampire. But even in the portrayal of the story we see elements we don't often see in Kdramas; little things like consistently appropriate music, superior lighting for the scenery that makes it look higher production, and a very cool opening title sequence (not that they're usually boring, but they aren't often this cool). Perhaps most unusual was a lack of love story subplots.If you liked Vampire Prosecutor and appreciated these elements, you'll like Vampire Prosecutor . Only six episodes have aired so far and we see *SPOILER* that a love story might brew up after all *END SPOILER* but I'm very much okay with that. Just do it well and I'll eat it up.In all, it has few flaws and again I have to throw in the word unique to describe it. Tired of typical crime mystery dramas? Give Vampire Prosecutor and its sequel, Vampire Prosecutor , a shot.", "Well to be frank, I literally thought that this show was going to suck. Cause maybe the first few minutes I started focusing on how horrible the camera man was. The scenes had too many close ups, it changed scenes like every five minutes, and the camera couldn't hold still. So I stopped watching it until I caught my friend watching it and so she told me to watch it instead since she was going to take a shower, (I couldn't find the remote to click it off) So I ended up watching it, only this time I focused more on the plot. By the end of episode , I was hooked. Deeply. The plot was very well made! The main character Min Tae Yeon, was very well made, as well were other characters' descriptions. Unfortunately, there were times when the acting was a bit of a cringe, but the well made plot made it disappeared. The main female lead... I didn't like her personality tbh. She was rude when it was unnecessary and she seemed really nosy in others businesses when she tells others not to get in her own. Her character was very smart, I'll give her that. Although, I thought she had a bit of a reason to behave the way she did, but that shouldn't mean to be rude when uncalled for. The nd male lead, his character was funny because he was a bit of a mess, but that has never stopped him. In fact, sometimes he used it to his advantage. He was actually trustworthy and very useful at times. And just to make him more human, he was a bit of a pervert. But more like a common guy liking women alot in that way. Sadly, he doesn't get anyone. The rd male lead is my second favorite next to the main character. Really, h e just a cowardly guy that is computer and forensics smart", "When I watch the casts' interview on TV promoting their drama, I was a little bit skeptical. I mean, really, how could I not?

Such a pitiful excuse.So, what started as let just watch this because I don't have anything else to watch turn into a binge watching show time. I finish the  seasons in  days. What fair Vampire Prosecutor from other vampire storyline is that it is Asian flavored. Instead of diving into a whole lot of historical existence, the story go its own way.Since every episode deal with a different case, the story managed to be different every time. They threw in dramatic thriller, romance and comedy along the way.I have to conclude this with  because I want too see more romance or bromance.

This drama certainly had the exact formula that made so many other K dramas a success.Then why is it not recognized on par with other K dramas out there? It's simple; the aim of this drama was to entertain. Unfortunately, there was no gimmick.Lee Dong Gun and Han Ji Hye did a wonderful job as a couple that were just beginning to get used to each other. The level of love and respect they show each other, as well as the hilarious scenes highlighting their comedic abilities, are believably sugary sweet. It brilliantly stuck to it's roots, keeping true to both the comedy and romantic aspect of it's genre. The romance and the hardships of marriage were mushy, gushy, sappy... and oh so adorable.There were no sticky love triangles or detailed misunderstandings that often frustrate viewers. Every single character (with the exception of perhaps, Lee Da Hae's humorous villain Moon Ga young) was realistically portrayed. It beautifully captured both the traditions and teachings of old with the fast paced life of the new. Korean tradition was brilliantly captured and respected; not mocked as it so often is in other drama. The action scenes were perhaps a bit silly to watch (matrix style jumps typical of K drama\u0085 which only added to the humor) but were also realistically portrayed.And\u0085 that's why it failed.

I'm not going to talk about filming and directing as I know nothing about all that. I will tell you about what I saw and more importantly what I felt. First, let me say I've been a big fan of Korean dramas for the past few years. I have never thought much of Ji Sung prior to this. I thought that his acting skills were okay moderate in his previous dramas. Either he had never previously been given the opportunity to really flex his skills or he has matured with experience over the years. I was blown away by his performance in Kill Me Heal Me. It would be an ambitious project for any actor to portray  distinctly different personalities. He not only does so but accomplishes it with such depth that you actually forget that they are personalities. You begin to see them as separate people and grow attached to each character. You feel their pain and joy and root for every single one of them. This bond with the characters, without giving away any plot points is a crucial factor in the emotional roller coaster journey throughout the drama to its conclusion. Ji Sung's skills were so incredible that it got to the point where you are able to identify the personality switch just by minute changes in his facial expression even without dialog, hair and clothing changes. I cannot say enough about the amazing performance he put forward in this project. Whether you are a fan of the story or not, you can't help but admire what he accomplished with this. If he doesn't win the Daesang for this, there is something seriously wrong with the judging system. The rest of the cast, Hwang Jung Eum, Park Seo Joon and the other supporting actors all give strong performances and there are no weak links. By that I mean, you don't feel let down or bored as the plot line switches to secondary plot threads. You will laugh and cry hard in this drama. For those of you not accustomed to the Korean style of humor in many dramas, it can sometimes get slapstick and over the top which is not everyone's cup of tea. However the humor in this drama will appeal universally. There are moments that will make you laugh so much you will cry and then there are others that will break your heart and make you cry for real.If you are looking for something that is a scientifically accurate portrayal of multiple personality disorder and you are going to nitpick every little inconsistency, then skip this. However if you are looking for a drama that you can lose yourself in, and one that will make you FEEL. Then watch this, you won't be disappointed.", "If you are reading this review, you probably might be interested in watching this TV show.I hope this review will change the might be part to must be \ud83d\ude02 Okay then!! kill me heal me, is one of those rare shows that is packed with almost all kind of emotions you look for in a good show. Suspense, mystery, romance, comedy and what not?! You will laugh, cry,smile, scream, go like wtf through out your journey with this show. This drama never loses its plot. It has an amazing story line. Plus the acting by all the actors is so on point. Ji Sung couldn't have played the role of a person suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder any better. He maintains an amazing balance between all his personalities. And trust me, you are going to admire all of them. While falling completely for his aggressive personality Shin Se Gi. He even transforms into a  year old girl, Yo Na. She is a total fun to watch. The actress of this drama, Oh ri jin, is again a very charming character. She is a psychiatrist by profession and secretly treats Cha do Hyun, who wants to hide his disorder from the world. Oh ri on is another beautiful character to watch out for. He plays the role of Oh ri jin's twin brother in the series, and there is no way that you won't end up feeling his plight by the end of this show. The story takes amazing twists and turns you wouldn't be expecting of. And ends up on a very good note Writer Jin Soo Wan has so beautifully written this delicate script. The complexities of this story will surely leave you thinking hard. But as the story will unfurl itself, you will find yourself completely in love with it. Do watch this show.. It surely is a breath of fresh air..", "I watched this series neither even having any idea about the show nor i know the language. I watched the show with English Subs, believe me!! It is simply the best show i ever came across in recent times. The lead actor and actress is just awesome and all i could do is praise their splendid performances. They are just fantastic. The plot is one of the another highlight in the show. It simple makes the audience drop their jaws. I laughed and cried at the same times. The music is haunting in such a way that, i even sometimes dream of it. You made it South Korea, you truly deserve some respect. I will simply place this next to Breaking Bad. To all the people in the world, all i want to say is go catch it right away. Rating  ", "What a plot! Actor Ji Sung's acting is mind blowing.He has portrayed  different characters with utmost sincerity.Kudos to this man!! I think only Ji Sung could have done justice to the role.Actress Hwang Jung eum also played her part well. The chemistry between both leads was excellent. Other support casts were good too. The music is excellent too!!This drama showcases Child Abuse and its effects.You will never get bored of any scenes or episodes.The lead pair must act in more dramas together. In this drama they were paired for the second time.This drama is a must watch!", "Kill me, heal me is an odd drama, in every way. First of all, it has an odd story that goes deeper and deeper, with plots and twists and more personalities jumping up from everywhere. And then there is the fact that unlike most dramas that start strong and then they flop towards the ending, this one starts badly and has a strong ending (wow talking about an odd drama!!) Okay, this one reminded me of the good old days when I was watching She was pretty and the entertainer (same actors, all favourites of mine!!). The story also brought back memories of the drama It's okay, it's love, though the later was dealing with mental health issues better and more in depth, even though Kill me, heal me deals more with children abuse. The story is nice, with a guy who has several personalities, all different (even a seventeen old girl!) who hires a personal doctor to help him keep them under control and not get caught by his family. In the meantime, the background story of them both is being revealed. The performances were on the point and really great, especially from the lead actor, who was amazing with changing his personality from a suicidal teen to a bad boy adventurer. The soundtrack was nice, but the same song kept playing over and over and it started getting annoying in the end. Plus the romance was weak, but the drama focused on the background story more than the romance so it was okay to not have the strong love story. I'm not sure if there was a love triangle in this one (SPOILER was her brother in love with her?) though it would have been unnecessary if there was. But only because it got boring in the middle and the beginning was weak, I'll rate this one  out of ."], "Sentiment Score": 0.6881818181818181}, "1144": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "895": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["This is an excellent Korean period piece. I am not a Korean nor do I know anything much about Korean history, but I could relate with the movie. The premise of the movie may seem a bit strange for modern viewers, but that was the sad truth: There were times in not so distant past when people were divided into strict social hierarchy; and it was a taboo to break those social norms. This movie is a simple triangular love story that forms between an aristocrat, his male servant, and an woman from aristocratic background that they both vie for. The cinematography is lush and full of colors, and the pacing of the film is slow without being boring. All three major actors played their part extremely well. Kim Ju Hyuk as the hapless servant caught between his love and his duty towards his master is subtle and subdued in his performance. He dominates all the scenes that he is in. Yeo Jeong Jo manages to expresses all the love, lust, and fierceness that a woman in her position can feel. And lastly Ryu Seung bum as the vain but effeminate lord manages to catch the psychology of the character so well that I couldn't help but sympathize with him. Despite his cruel motive to destroy the two lovers, we do understand him not to be a demon; but just a regular guy who needs a hug. Don't be fooled by the love scenes. They are organically stitched to the overall movie, so it does not feel like it has been misplaced simply for the sake of titillation. Overall, this movie is a great viewing!!", "Last year I was incredibly fortunate to see this adorable movie when it premiered at The Korean Film Festival in Auckland. It was showing at The Academy, which is an informal art house cinema in the basement of The Public Library. I was the only non Asian person there too. For a Frock Movie fan like myself this was the most wonderful experience. The lush locations, hyper color cinematography, the superb costumes and beautiful set dressing alone, make it a must see. The surprising thing about the story, is that it is a comedy. I might not have realised this watching it with just English sub titles. The audience at the festival were laughing a lot. It appears it is a spoof of a traditional story which everyone knows. The script is very tongue in cheek and a bit anarchic. Think 'Blackadder view of historical events as a comparison. I wish this genre of films were more easily viewed. I am back in Cornwall now and there is no way I would have seen it here.", "Like folktales that goes through the eyes from a different perspective like the Three Little Pigs taken from the Big Bad Wolf's perceptive and the same going for Little Red Riding Hood. This one takes a Korean folktale and tells the story from Bang Ja's perspective while the high ranking guy is the evil one. And while Bang Ja is in love with Lady Chun Hyang the high ranking guy who in the original folktale is like the charming prince just thinks of her as a piece of meat. And this story which is a twisted retelling of the folktale goes in a more depressing and tragic direction. While making this story out to be the true tale of what happened. Where none of the characters are likable and isn't a tale for younger audiences. Most of the way through the movie shows Bang Ja in love with Lady Chun Hyang. So in order to win her because he is just a lowly servant, gets training how to sexually flirt with girls from Old man Ma who has a reputation for sleeping with many women using certain techniques to attract them. It probably won't work this day and age but it might have worked back then. But it was intriguing and kinda funny to see Old man Ma show the guy the ropes. And I think these types of scenarios made this movie a hit in Korea. While showing the realistic portrayal of thing, even if it isn't moralistically right. The ending seems a bit slightly forced into to show how the original folktale came to be but it's passable. This isn't a romance flick but a erotic love story I guess. Overall this movie is alright it's not a moving flick or a feel good one, in fact it's a depressing one that has somewhat realistic but negative message at the end. Men are known for falling for a girl over their beauty over personality and that really shows in this one I guess cause there really isn't anything likable about Chun Hyang..

This fake variety show involves her going to live and work with the mother of the guy she's pretend dating, along with said guy, and their extended family.This shows stars Kim Dasom (I don't know what her actress name or real life name is, but she's a member of the idol group Sistar). I am familiar with Sistar and who Dasom is, but this my first exposure to her as an actress. She has participated in two other TV dramas prior to this, but they were both well over  episodes, and I have neither the time nor inclination to watch shows of that length. The first thing you should know about Dasom is that she is SMOKING hot (just like all of her Sistar idol mates). The entire group is built (ahem) to be as sexy as possible, while still trying to exhibit a cute and fun appeal at the same time; go watch some of their music videos and you'll see what I'm referring to. Can Dasom act though?, and, is this show worthwhile?...well, let's find out!As our story begins, Dasom's character (Oh In Young) makes her way to the variety show set (which takes place in a farm home setting which prepares various traditional Korean food & sauces for restaurants & other buyers). This is a place that requires you to work hard and get your hands dirty. In Young, however, loves her high heels and skimpy flashy outfits and she's ill suited for this environment at first. As such, the family she's moved in with disapproves of her right away, but they've agreed to do the show, and if it's well received, their business will prosper (and so will In Young and her idol group & company). Over time, the show becomes popular as In Young fits in a little better, and starts slowly winning over the entire family and their ever discerning family matriarch. And of course, she and her nerdy but handsome fake show love interest costar begin to have actual feelings for each other.You'll immediately notice this show has a pretty low budget. That's OK, but you must compensate for fiscal restraints by having some combination of a good story, solid writing, proper direction, and stellar acting performances. Unfortunately, this show doesn't really do any one of those things very well. You know you're in for some pain and suffering when the first couple of episodes consist mainly of a midriff baring lead having multiple gassy fart problems, followed by the introduction of several stereotypical self centered & annoying Korean cinema mothers, followed by a bunch of mama boys that need to grow up, followed by younger female characters who are searching for self empowerment. YUK!The second thing you'll notice about this show is that it resembles a long running day time Korean soap opera that's been compressed to  episodes and played on fast forward. Almost every scene consists of a one or two minute interaction between one or more cast members, then it's on to the next one or two minute scene. The way it's scripted and framed doesn't help matters either; it consists mainly of a close up shot of Character A reading a single line, then a close up of Character B reading a single line, then repeat some back and forth like this until the end of their short scene. At the end of each scene, someone references or mentions something about a rd party not involved in the current scene. Then, cut away to said rd party having their own short scene, then continue this formula FOREVER until the show eventually concludes.Because of how the scenes are written, there never seems to be any personal interaction or meaningful communication among any of the character. It feels like everyone is just reading lines and nothing more. All of the characters involved are supposed to evolve over time, but it's a very cumbersome & repetitive process along the way; someone accepts someone, then turns their back on them, then accepts them again; this pattern of behavior is repeated often throughout this show between multiple characters, and, it really becomes tedious and just plain absurd as the show drags on. As a result, this show is severely lacking in any depth, and it fails to ever build any suspense, tension, or momentum.The cast does what they're asked, and they mostly do OK (but just barely). There are several insufferable performances though, and no standout ones. The cast's star power and  or acting prowess (or lack thereof) isn't the problem here though; where this show fails clearly lies at the feet of the writers and the director. Good K dramas build towards their climax and include multiple important scenes where you can't take your eyes off the screen, which in turn, engages the viewer to invest in the story, care about its characters, and look forward to the next episode. Sadly, this show doesn't ever accomplish any of this. As far as Dasom's performance goes, she did all right with what she was given to work with. I doubt she'll ever win any best actress awards, but she could likely make a decent living in this field if given the chance to be aligned with shows that have better stories and some decent writing and direction. Until that happens though, she shouldn't quit her day job with Sistar (which she is excellent at)!Summary: Unfortunately, I have to drop the hammer on this show; it's neither interesting nor intelligent nor original. This is clearly a project that was just designed to quickly fill a time slot and nothing more. In short, it has no heart and no soul.

It's a straightforward ensemble drama that will most likely grow on you pretty quickly.SPOILERS AHEAD!Not to stereotype them, but the  girls can basically be best initially summarized as follows:. The sexy girl who's not shy about sleeping around. She cares mostly about herself, her looks, and how she can use those looks and her body to get various guys to be her sugar daddies.. The cute girl who's desperate to be loved but won't be until she can bring herself to break up with her loser boyfriend and find some self esteem & maturity..

The fun loving party girl who tries so hard to get a man to like her and see her as a woman, but always ends up getting stuck in the friend zone.. The youngest and newest tenant. She's shy, has never dated, and is mainly concerned with just trying to adapt to the big city college environment and fit in with her new roommates.The girls are mostly somewhat strangers to one another, but they get to know each other over time, bicker some along the way, make up with one another, and generally just learn to get along and support each other as best they can. They do bond together and stick up for their housemates when called for though, and they clearly care for one another, even though they don't always know how to show it or what to do to help one another.Collectively, the  girls make a very nice mix of various personas & personalities, and this is one of the show's best attributes. They are all imperfect creatures for sure, and they each have their own back stories, a secret or two, and reasons why they act the way they do, but this only adds to their appeal as relatable characters, and you'll soon start rooting for all of them to succeed, grow, move on, or whatever it is they are each trying to accomplish.Though not hugely famous film or TV stars as of yet, each of the  primary cast members is VERY good in their assigned roles here, and they consistently work well both together and separately throughout. This is a credit to both them and the director, and this is augmented by the oft smart screen writing throughout the show. Each of the  gets fairly equal screen time and story lines, so don't be fooled into thinking otherwise based on the first episode or two alone (which primarily focuses on the young new girl).Aside from the writing, directing, and acting, one of the other things I really like about this show is its maturity. In a K drama, you don't often see a woman nonchalantly ripping off her bra as soon as she gets home, or someone hoping her comatose brother would just die so she can get out from under medical bills and finally get on with her life, etc...The show was rated for age  or older to watch, and I think that's appropriate, but it has a very mature feel to it compared to most of the K dramas I've seen of this age rating.There are plenty of other things to like with this show as well; in character Q&A epilogues after each episode fit neatly within the concept of the story without seemingly being tacked on for filler or for no reason, the story lines are varied and nicely thought out, the show bounces back and forth between glee, sadness, and a common middle ground with ease, and so on. There's not much in the way of super fancy production values to speak of, but you don't really need them to be in a drama like this, and everything looks fine.The male actors in this show are basically all secondary characters; they do what's required of them well enough when needed within the framework of the overall story lines, but that's all they are there for. There are also several K drama staples, clich\u00e9s, & tropes thrown in as expected; debt collectors, some talk of a ghost, a stalker type guy or two, sick dying dead people, etc...however, none of this takes away from the theme of the show, which is simply watching the  girls continuing their daily lives regardless of any man, side story, or anything else that's taking place around them.Overall, this is a really well done show. Perhaps the best compliment I can pay it is that it never wears out its welcome; the  lead characters, while you may not always like them or their life choices, well, they will be missed. Future KTV programmers, writers, and directors everywhere should take a lesson from this show, and that is: Always Leave the Viewer Wanting More!Summary: I wasn't even planning on watching this because the premise didn't seem to be initially appealing to me. But, I caught a few early episodes, and I was hooked. It's witty, well written, engaging, and efficient. I will take a story like this anytime over the flashier and more popular, yet often predictably unfulfilling, ones that follow the same basic K drama premise time and time again. It probably won't be a big hit with the masses, or crowds that are mostly interested in Cinderella gets doted on by a bunch of rich young hot guys stories, but it is quite good.Bottom Line: Personally, this is my favorite K drama of  to date. I'm giving it  out of  stars accordingly...Totally Recommended!", "Age Of Youth is one of my favourite K dramas and a must watch. To summarize, it is about five roommates in their twenties, struggling with work, romance, and family issues. I found it while browsing Netflix and decided to give it a shot. The first ten minutes were pretty boring and I almost gave up with it but I'm so glad I didn't.The thing that made Age Of Youth stand out were the awesome characters. Each of the five main characters were so lovable and I am hard pressed to pick a favourite, although I would probably go with Jin Myung. They all have their secrets, and their very different personalities is what keeps it interesting. They all got roughly the same amount of screen time although I think it does tend to focus a little on the new girl to the flat, Eun Jae, especially in the first and last episode. Although most of the cast is relatively unknown they all do a great job. I also found it really refreshing that the show wasn't just based around romance, as a lot of Korean dramas are, but I must admit I squealed a bit when two of the characters I shipped finally got together about halfway through. The writing is just overall very good, always maintaining the balance between humour and seriousness.Another great thing about it was the soundtrack. It was so calm and understated and for the mood of the show perfectly.One of the reasons Age Of Youth stood out for me was the quirky little original things, such as the mini interviews with the characters at the end of each episode. They were funny and insightful, and not something I've seen done before.In summary, Age Of Youth has a fresh and original vibe and I would definitely give it a try,", "There isnt much to say. It is absolutely one of the best of korean dramas. Well written characters, fast paced scenario and no irrational scene. I hope there will be a third season(without reducing the quality of course).", "Found this show while searching for something a little different on my Netflix cue. Seriously a breath of fresh air! I've never watched any Korean dramas before, and wasn't sure what to expect. This far exceeded my expectations!I loved getting to know the five main characters, who become more and more dimensional with each episode. I did not want the first season to end! I highly recommend to anyone bored with depressing Indie American drama, who is looking for something with a little more heart.", "Age of Youth or the Netflix title of Hello, My Twenties is a charming, funny, fresh, and often addictive show to get into. I was disappointed to see that Netflix only had Season  available. Yes, that is how much I enjoyed it! I wanted to keep watching!This intelligent and creative show is about five young women who live in a share house. Of course, they come from different walks of life, have different backgrounds, and much like most people, each of them carries a secret. Like any roommates who share a living space, they get along, they laugh, they cry, and they often argue and fight. But make no mistake. These girls truly love each other and do their best to be there for each other. That is truly the beauty of this show. It proves that a family doesn't have to be your nuclear family. In fact, it's a bit interesting and ironic, that in some cases, these girls seem closer to each other than with their parents.There are some truly touching moments that might tug at your heartstrings, some incredibly hilarious moments that might get you laughing out loud for a spell, and even some thought provoking moments. In short, this show has just about everything.First, we have Jin Myung Yoon. Yoon doesn't say much, but when she does speak, she is honest and sincere, even to the point of being blunt. She comes across as cold, but she really isn't. Her tough exterior hides the wounded woman suffering through the pain of believing that she's alone. She's cautious about who she opens up to, and when she does, Yoon speaks her mind. She has a challenge of truly connecting with people and showing them who she is. However, she loves her roommates, and will do anything for them. She works three jobs and goes to school. She is the most mature of all of them, and she is my personal favorite. Next is Ye Eun Jung, who is probably the most immature of the group and has some serious self esteem issues. She adores her boyfriend, despite the poor way that he treats her. Everything is about status with her. She cares about how she looks, what she wears, how much she weighs, and what everyone thinks about her. She is prone to be thoughtless, but she is also cheerful, cute, and despite her clashes with Kang, she also cares very deeply for her fellow roommates.Ji Won Song is the most energetic and creative of the bunch. She also has absolutely no problem expressing herself. She's never embarrassed. She will also frequently take the initiative in activities where others are hesitant. She lives her life a bit on the edge, and sometimes gets a bit carried away with the truth. She is rarely ever down or upset, and she is the one most likely to try and cheer up a friend.Kang Yi Na is the only one who doesn't share a room with anyone else. A woman with a tragic past, she works as an escort. She also has no vices about walking around with little nothing on, which makes some of the other roommates uncomfortable. She has more life knowledge than the other girls, especially about how men behave. She isn't tricked by the antics that men play, and this gets her into fights with Ye Eun over Ye Eun's naivety about her own boyfriend. It's a toss up as to who is tougher: Kang or Yoon.Lastly, we have Eun Jae, who is the newest addition to the house. She is also the youngest with the least amount of life experience. Coming from the country, she is a young woman who is extremely naive about how things work. It is also very difficult for her to speak her mind or even speak up about things until it's already reached a boiling point. Very sweet with a timid personality, she is very much like the baby sister of the group. All of the other girls feel a sense of protectiveness toward her.Not only is the writing top notch, but so is the acting. These five women have a certain chemistry that can't be overlooked. They know their characters inside and out, and they make the show work! Each brings something special to the table, but it's those moments when they are truly looking out for each other as well as being there for each other that demonstrates the true power of the show. I would guess that many people would love to have a family like this! Why? Because no matter what happens, at the end of the day, they truly love each other, and isn't that what a family is?**Netflix finally released Season , and the show is just as good as ever, adding a couple of new characters, and leaving me hoping and praying for a Season !**"], "Sentiment Score": 0.98375}, "182": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Negative", "Reviews": ["Jong suk doing action is something new.

Although there are a few clich\u00e9s such as good vs evil, the plot is well written and pretty unpredictable. My only caveat is that some of the subplots in Oh Yeon joo's world were not as interesting. Overall, this drama is a must watch and most certainly among the best kdramas out there.", "Note: Check me out as the Asian Movie Enthusiast on YouTube, where I review tons of Asian movies.A romance takes place between a man (played by Jong suk Lee) who exists within a webtoon known as W, and a woman (played by Hyo joo Han) who is in the real world. The woman's father is the webtoon artist who makes the protagonist's life a living hell, creating the murder of his parents by the hands of an unknown killer. But as the comic world comes to life and clashes with the real world, the people of both worlds are confronted with danger.This is an interesting premise that has been done before. This K drama has some vague similarities to films like The Matrix or Last Action Hero, but it carves out its own identity and develops in unpredictable ways. In fact, it's virtually impossible to predict what's going to happen from one episode to the next. One reason for this is that it gradually adds layers and develops the rule system of this particular comic book world, which offers many intriguing turns of events and some wicked plot twists. The end of episode  feels like a climactic event, and there are many such events that throw you for a loop because they are things that would probably happen at the end of a film with a similar premise. This creates a sense of excitement that is sustained for most of the episodes, and that excitement is earned thru characters and scriptwriting instead of overblown or cartoonish action scenes.Most fortunately, the storyline is presented organically and naturally. This show does make an admirable attempt to sufficiently close as many plot holes that it reasonably can, but it still feels a bit contrived in spots. This is especially true during the final few episodes, which have a slight sense of randomness to them. Prior to that, everything seemed very neat and tidy in terms of following the rule system of the worlds, but that seemed to come loose a bit down the stretch. And that would be my primary criticism of this show \u2013 it seemed like they didn't really know how to end it. It felt a bit anticlimactic. Personally, I would preferred a more traditional, higher octane finale.In any case, all of the acting in this K drama is very good. I've covered Hyo joo Han a handful of times already in my reviews of The Beauty Inside and Cold Eyes. But she expresses a very wide range of emotion in this, giving a nuanced and energetic performance. I was less familiar with the lead actor, but he did a solid job as well.A few other random compliments are that I really enjoyed the theme tune, which is quite catchy. There is a splash of comic book imagery that I enjoyed. And there is also one particularly creepy special effect that is used on one character's face during the middle episodes.", "This is definitely one of the best dramas I've seen in a while, and I think it might just be my favorite yet, and believe me I have seen a lot of TV Series.. The acting is absolutely phenomenal and I love everything about this drama! The concept and plot is original and unique, and the actors have great chemistry. With each episode you keep getting pulled in by the story to the point you cannot wait for the next episode to come out. It holds a perfect blend of humor, action, suspense mystery, drama, and love!! I never write reviews but I'm just so in love with this one that I want it to get the full recognition it deserves.For any of you considering it, I truly and highly recommend this drama!", "Don't be surprised if you'll end up binge watching this k drama. It happened to me, though I was reluctant at first to see it. The story seemed a bit strange and complicated about two parallel worlds. Also I was misled by the synopsis thinking it would be a live action webtoon. However, this mini series was so much more.I found W a.k.a Two Worlds a thrilling, well acted and visually glamorous k drama that's a homage to old film noirs and detective stories. Filled with classic heroes and villains, cliffhangers, blazing guns and screeching tires. The slow paced, old fashioned romance added to this nostalgic feel as did the mysterious music score.

This is one of those that carry heavy loads of emotions, which in the midst of doubt, became one of my favorites. Great story line. Very interesting yet frustrating plot.

The characters were rich, spoiled youngsters, playing drama with anyone. Plus, the great seducer had, like one (?) girl seduced and that was it. So, seducer was more like a title that everyone repeated rather than the real deal. So, one should expect that the big plot will play nice and with a slow built up so that the drama will keep up with appearances. Well, that wasn't the case either. The romance was developed so fast, that we spent the rest of the episodes lovey dovey or breaking up. Wasn't the girl supposed to be cold and not to believe in love? In addition, there were too many secondary characters, so many stories here and there, to, probably, distruct you from the main story that wasn't going as planned. But, they were boring too. Even the secondary love story didn't help. And there was the ending.

Thi show had nothing to do with seduction. We'll see the male lead seduce literally one woman in the first episode and and then just fall in love with another. \nThe whole romance happened so fast there was no time to catch a breath for anyone. The female leas is supposedly hate love and totally be against dating but here you go, seeing her head over heels in love with this seducing boy in just one day. I didn't see any romance developing. It just came from no where. Plus it was so cheesy I had pain cringing all the time. Another disappointment.We've seen a lot love going on then.

The female lead turned out to be all happy smiling and laughing about everything he says and does, taking selcas and stuff..... I mean how did we get there...Then it just went crazy. Fight after fight, followed by making up a day later, more fights, more breaking up and making up. One secret gets discovered another one comes up and right after that another. Ugh.... Of course one worse than the other.

However, it was cute, even though the story was full of cliche and the leading lady was a silly, airheaded girl. But, the drama got boring halfway.

So, I honestly had my hopes up and was eagerly looking forward for a great rom com when I began watching this.But my high expectations were soon shattered and I was disappointed as the story was very lame and unrealistic.SPOILER AHEAD: Kim Hyung Joong's character Baek Seung jo was supposed to be a genius at studies with a high level of IQ who has the potential of entering any top university and perusing any profession. Initially, he is annoyed by Oh Ha ni played by Jung So min who has a mega crush for him. Jung So Min's character is portrayed as a very clumsy, needy, weak girl which made me annoyed with her character. Yet, Beak's mother seems to be in favour of Ha ni and even wants to make her the wife of his son despite how stupid she appears and dislike of his son. The couple in fact ends marrying at a very young age.Overall, I somehow ended up finishing the drama as the couple was cute and I liked both Kim Hyung Joong and Jung So Min.

This is another modern Korean fantasy drama, albeit one that it is unusually understated and low key in comparison to most of its more melodramatic & or romantic brethren.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your basic story: A man receives a visit from his older brother shortly before said brother passes away. The older brother appeared to be insane during the visit and was claiming he had found a way to alter time. The man goes to retrieve his older brother's body and investigates his death, and he soon finds that his brother was not crazy at all; he actually had discovered the means to travel back in time via some magical incense sticks. The younger brother collects the remaining incense sticks ( of them), and thus now possesses nine chances to alter the past. Light a stick and you'll go back in time to an exact set date for  minutes until the incense burns out, then you're zapped backed to the present day (where whatever you've just done in the past is instantly reflected in the present).The story focuses primarily on the young brother, who experienced a family tragedy when he was a teen that forever impacted his life and everyone he loves. He therefore decides to use the time travel incense to change crucial events in his family's history in order to prevent this tragedy from happening in the first place. He has the best of intentions, but altering the past soon becomes much more complicated than he imagined. Every change he makes for the better in the past creates unexpected future results, and he soon finds that various friends & family members lead vastly different lives or no longer recognize him in the present. As such, he keeps going back to the past to try to undo the unintended future changes he created, but things only seem to be getting worse and soon are spiraling out of control, and, he's quickly running out of magic incense sticks to rectify the situation.From there on in, it's just a matter of seeing if this guy can somehow set things right before time runs out. Moral of the story: It's probably best to not mess around with the past no matter what your intentions are.Lee Jin Wook plays the lead and primary focal point of the show, and he's quite good in what is an understated role. Everyone else is mostly a supporting character, and they're pretty good in their roles too (particularly the love interest in the present, and the younger versions of everybody in the past). Although, I must say I could've done without some of the overacting from the evil scientist dude and the lead's doctor friend...and, while I'm on the subject, I've never understood why the directors of some these KTV shows would want or allow actors to perform in this manner. In this medium, overacting occurs far too often with the some of the side characters; constantly flashing a clumsy menacing stare or wildly waving your arms around does not help make a character more evil or funnier, respectively. It doesn't work and its distracting more than anything else, and you usually end up occasionally chuckling at the supposed bad guy and growing annoyed of the guy who's supposed to be the friendly comic relief. A lot less brooding & mugging, and a little more subtlety for these  particular characters is definitely in order here, as is also true with many other non protagonist characters on many other Korean dramas.This show doesn't seem to have a whole lot of money to throw around, but it never looks overly cheap; productions values are solid for its given budget, but there is very little excess in any form or fashion to be had here. It's paced well enough, and the story & writing is quite good as well; it almost seems that this was written in advance (and, not on the fly, like most K dramas are). The interactions across time, between the younger and older versions of the same protagonist, are quite well done in particular.There's definitely a minimalistic feel to this entire show (which I found to be somewhat refreshing for this genre), and this approach extends itself to the story as well; it retains many familiar melodramatic elements & themes & story lines that you'll find in this genre, but it does so w o love quadrangles, meticulously styled auxiliary antagonists, etc. For Korean TV, this is basically a no frills drama about the implications of trying to change your past, and overall, it is quite good at accomplishing this.Summary: This is a subdued, and rather well done, KTV time travel melodrama that I rather enjoyed for the most part. Yeah, it's got some flaws, but what K drama doesn't? I can see that it might not play all that well to some of the masses that most K dramas are geared towards, as it's just neither a very flashy, sexy, or romantic soap opera type of show. There's nothing wrong with flashy sexy romantic K dramas, and I like some of those shows too, but if you don't necessarily need or want a show like that, while still getting your K drama fix on, this show might work quite well for you.Bottom Line: . out of  stars!Very Well Recommended!", "What would you do if you had the power to travel back into time and change events in your life? Should one play God with people's lives? Should one alter the natural order of things? Is it a curse or is it gift? You know you're watching something remarkable when you are still thinking about it when it's long over. I took a chance and recently binged watched this show on HULU, and I'm so glad I did so. It hooks you in after the first episode in the twenty episode series. The story is amazing and full with epic, beautiful moments that touches your heartstrings and make you feel for the characters. The beautiful memories and the tender simple moments of affection, humor, and angst are better than ninety percent of American television shows on the air today. It also did not hurt that Jin wook Lee, the star of the show is very easy on the eyes with the charming, sarcastic, humorous, and commanding portrayal of his character Park Sun Woo. Lee is a handsome leading man with a captivating presence that draws you in, and you understand why his love interest, Joo Min Young has been in love with him for five years. There are just moments when you could just admire him turning around in a room or the camera focusing on him simply sitting down. It is like admiring stills of Brad Pitt in the Curious Case of Benjamin Button.This show itself is about a man named Park Sun Woo, a well known television reporter, with a pretty good life. He travels to Nepal after learning that his brother Park Jung Woo was discovered dead hiking in the snowy mountains of Nepal. He discovers that his brother Park Jung Woo was searching for these nine incense sticks (hence the title nine time travels) that allows him to travel back in time on whatever day it is, twenty years in the past. Park Sun Woo uses the sticks to go back into time to altered events to save his brother's life and also to fix his family. His father died twenty years ago in a fire. His mother is in some type of nursing home for Alzheimer's disease and his brother was a drifter throughout his life. He uses the sticks to fix everyone else's problems and ends up altering his own life in the process. The show questions karma, morals, and consequences of our decisions and how it affects our lives or even the lives of the people around us.There are so many great moments in this show and even the special effects were amazing. The love story between Park Sun Woo and Joo Min Young is so sweet, beautiful, and romantic. You're scooped into it in the first few minutes when she smiles and waves to meet him at the airport; he spots her and kisses her then asked her to marry him out of the blue. I could relate to Joo Min Young because I see some of her characteristics in me, and it's amazing to see her character along with the other characters evolve throughout the show. It's an amazing show with beautiful scenery, storyline, an amazing love story, and great writing\u0085it's amazing all around. I enjoyed it from the pilot episode to the end and I still am thinking about it and the endless possibilities of alternate realities, the butterfly effects, and how one moment can alter your entire life.

The drama turns into a terrific one that I have not ever encountered.The plot is creative and logical. An atypical time travel drama. The male lead can go back to the past and change the history. He hope to save his brother's life through altering the past, but ending up creating more fuss for the present life. He has to go back to the past and fix the problem he bring about. Acting of male lead is superb. Different from the typical oppa his skin is blacker, making him less korean. The female lead is not very overwhelmingly beautiful and girlish, but is boyly with her short hair, refreshing, young and look innocent. I would say this kdrama is not so korean.

Then, it starts focusing on the past affairs, as well as the currant ones. It's amazing how the film makers managed to present the medley of past present so beautiful, without confusing the audience or tiring them.

Views are offered in and around the cockpit bubble, sometimes slowed down for somewhat comical staring of daggers between opponents. There's the usual dogfights between planes   having the F  do battle against its arch rival the MiG    is pure delight for any combat aviation fan, and if my eyes didn't play tricks on me, look out for the MiG's fabled cobra maneuver   I'd almost jump out of my seat with disbelief and glee when that happened.Soar into the Sun has a whole host of arsenal deployed and missions to fulfill, such as air to  air, surface to air, air to surface missiles, anti aircraft guns, and missions from routine patrols, infiltration, and search and rescue all making it one holistic look at the workings of an air force. And what's more, not only do fighter pilots get in on the action, but attention being paid to the ground technical crew who keep the planes in tip top condition in between sorties, as well as ground commandos in extraction missions using their fixed wing aircraft, trained to rescue pilots who are downed behind enemy lines   and yes, this is yet another subplot that managed to find its way into the narrative, based on the John Moore film in  starring Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson in his rare outing as an action hero.Rain completed this film before heading toward his obligatory national service, and here he plays hotshot (what else?) pilot Jung Tae Hoon, who's the youngest in the acrobatic Black Eagles team, flying the FA  T Golden Eagle (flown by Indonesia and South Korea's air force only), which is a trainer and multi role fighter. But his decision to spice up a routine air show wasn't appreciated, and he also becomes the fastest to get sacked from the acrobatic team, being redeployed to an operationally ready squadron because its commanding officer believes that his talent with an aircraft shouldn't be gone to waste.What is probably unheard of if this is done by Hollywood, is to admit that the main protagonist isn't the perfect all rounder he is. It's established early on that Tae Hoon is the specialist in low flying, so he isn't quite cut out, as scenes would prove, that he's dogfight material. so this means Rain having to step aside and share the limelight with Yu Jun Sang as Major Lee, who is their squadron's ace. And although the F K variant here is obviously the aircraft of choice and the superior fighter in the film, it's a nod toward Korean pride to have its lead fly the FA  T  Golden Eagle for his final, all important mission that delivered the payload.The money shot is of course what you've caught a glimpse of in the trailer, where two F s are hot on the heels of a MiG , or at times, vice versa, as they storm through the skyscape of Seoul. The stunt and visual effects team did a great job to create that urban battle scenario, and yes I'm raving about that cobra maneuver again. Aerial combats in the film are sleekly choreographed, and the brownie points come in watching this in a theatre with optimal sound, because you'll be able to hear the roar of the planes' afterburners when they kick in.So I guess it's enough on the hardware and the technical aspects of Soar into the Sun, so what about the storyline? It's perfunctory to say the least, with balance achieved in providing the myriad of characters their particular idiosyncrasies and one note role in the narrative. There's the token love interest for Tae Hoon in Sergeant Se Young (Shin Se Kyung), the prettiest and most competent technical ground crew around, her boss and comic relief played by Oh Dal  Su, fellow co pilot Yoo Jin (Lee Ha Na), and the rookie (Lee Jong Suk) whom I do not know how he'd pass the pilot qualifying tests for his frequent fainting spells when subjected to high G forces.Soar into the Sun, also known as RB: Return to Base, is pure entertainment, where the story didn't really do much, with odd screwball comedy thrown around, it does provide one heck of an adrenaline ride. Rain fans will celebrate at an obligatory scene where their idol appears topless, but the real stars of the film, are the military hardware on display. And this scores from every angle you're seeing this film from. So I'd give it a biased definite recommendation!", "South Korea's answer to TOP GUN ()    SOAR INTO THE SUN (a.k.a. RB: RETURN TO BASE) is a big budget blockbuster tries to replicate the Hollywood style of filmmaking mostly found in any summer movie tentpole. It certainly has that showy and expensive look, particularly for its many impressive aerial stunts (more on that later). But writer director Kim Dong Won botches everything up with too many cheesy melodrama and mawkish sentimentality borderlined into self parody. No wonder the movie ends up underperformed at the domestic box office.In this embarrassingly lackluster movie, the story centers on Jang Tae Hun (Rain), a cocky young pilot of the South Korean Air Force's elite Black Eagles squad who gets expelled of the team, following from his dangerous daredevil stunt at an air show. As a punishment, he is immediately transferred to the  Combat Unit, which is led by Park Dae Seo (Kim Sung Su). Meanwhile, it doesn't take long before he makes enemy with an ace pilot Lee Cheol Hee (Yu Jun Sang), who particularly hate each other. Naturally, they prepare to engage in a flight contest to see which among of them emerge as the best pilot in the  Combat Unit. Of course, such genre movie like that wouldn't be complete without an obligatory love interest. Enter Sgt. Yoo Se Young (Shin Se Kyung), a failed pilot turned head of maintenance who loves to act cool and doesn't particularly talks much, even though Tae Hun likes her very much.Clocking at  minutes, I must admit that watching SOAR INTO THE SUN is seriously a test of patience. The first half is especially a huge letdown, in which the story drags too much that goes into nowhere. Most of the time we are forced to sit through a long winded stretch of some lame romantic comedy (particularly the one involving Tae Hun and Se Young) found in Korean TV drama, and not to mention, many other annoying subplots. If Kim Dong Won is trying hard to be funny, then he fails miserably. Even by the time the movie reaches the second half with a sudden change of dramatic tone, it's already too late and too little to redeem everything.Still, those are looking forward for some sensory thrills will be excited by the aforementioned aerial stunts. The two climactic highlights    the aerial battle within the city of Seoul and the explosive finale    are undeniably breathtaking with swooping cameraworks and magnificent sound effects that they are best seen in a big screen theaters.Too bad that's the only good thing about this movie. The rest is simply a monumental waste of time. If that's not insulting enough, the cast is a total disappointment who are all nothing more than one note stereotypical characters. Rain, who completed this movie before heading off for his obligatory national service, gives an unremarkable performance who spends most of the time looking too cheesy or (ahem) cutesy. Sure, he does show some seriousness towards the second half, but by then, it's really hard to take him seriously. As for the rest of the supporting actors, the less said the better.So much for a so called movie specially released in remembrance of the th anniversary of the Korean War.", "Weak storyline, like most aviation film much as to my disappoint this could have gotten a good  if the writers thought of a better script. There was too many silly lines that I wonder if this was suppose to be a manga filled humour or a live action film.

Poor CGI, while it is understandable that there are parts of the film where real fighter jets cannot be used i.e. city dog fight scenes, I believe that they could have done a better job. The characters, I really don't think the Korean Air force would have allowed impulsive, childish and hot headed pilots into their ranks. And what is with them abusing the engineers.

I ran my player at X to X speed to skip the plastic human relationships. Characters don't make sense to me. Pilots were treated like stupid people. Same as mechanics. No dignity for pilots and mechanics. This movie didn't do justice to them.

The CG is absolutely perfect, the VFX and sound FX are great as well.The first half of the movie contain mostly the Korean's dramatic scene found in most Korean movie. It could be funny, with a little to no excitement at all. The first half suffer greatly from too many antics from Tae Hun, a fail attempt at love, straightforward plot which you know what will happen next, and Rain himself. You can't take him seriously by the time second half begin.Also, they copy the Tower fly by scene from TOP GUN.The second half contain some serious and intense action scene. The CG dogfighting in Seoul and the strike at Wonsan base is really amazing and look realistic. However it is lack of realistic detail and can be really annoying.Military expert can get really annoyed by the action scene, filled with unrealistic event. The dogfight scene break several laws of aerodynamic and thermodynamic. The missile locking system are strange too. In several events you can see the pilot shoot a ground target with air to air missile. Also, The director forgot that MiG A carry only  round of ammunition for the cannon. But the excitement of the battle mean that we can ignore that. The movie end with another f*cking romantic scene.

I was touched by some of the subject matters and found them to be really modern and surprising compared to the more fairytale esque worlds of other dramas.

However, that part was boring, as the male lead was boring overall, with no actual personality. The ending at least was decent and didn't stick to the cliche romantic endings.

The Thornbirds, Roots and other early TV mini series were long movies broken into consecutive episodes. I love a mini series as a melodrama that tells a story in the long movie format, as opposed to those that tell different stories in the same setting (like Grey's Anatomy, Mad Men and to a lesser extent Damages, Breaking Bad, and Revenge that change the story at times while keeping to a general story). In this regard, I have discovered some gems in the South Korean TV mini series of recent years.The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back. This me recur in the same story. Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved. If personality dynamics are properly depicted in a valid manner, and if the production is skillful, powerful emotions can be evoked in the viewer. In this way we can live many lifetimes through movies, in our one lifetime   greatly enriching our incarnate experience.These South Korean productions (seen on Netflix streaming) are first class with excellent production and direction, some terrific casting and acting (particularly from some of the females who give some matchless world class performances), brilliant musical accompaniment, and staging. What makes these so good is the way they skillfully evoke deep emotion in the viewer. South Korean movie making is superb   world class.However, the following caveats must be considered by the USA viewer. They are subtitled and some people hate this. The South Korean cultural norms, values and sanctions may sometimes seems silly or old fashioned to the USA viewer. The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation unity   sometimes reminiscence of a old Frank Capra film.Most importantly, in order for the sometimes complicated sub plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing, and this leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people, that sometimes seem to be unlikely by USA cultural standards. The viewer may wonder at times why good but trusting people are so easily manipulated and deceived by bad and selfish people, but con artists do often succeed (just look at politicians for example). However this poetic license of improbability is needed to develop the story   just accept it as occurring even though unlikely at times. Taking these factors into account Will help you become involved and emotionally engrossed. It was hard t for me to quit watching at times so I binged watched.I would rank these as follows but tastes differ and your rankings might not agree:     (hard to say which is best)Shining InheritanceWhen a Man LovesThat Winter, The Wind BlowsSecret Garden. Five Fingers. The Scent of a Woman. The Great Queen Seondeok. A Hundred Years Inheritance. Lie To me. Roof Top Prince. Dr. Jin. The Great DoctorShining inheritance is about family, love, greed, deceit, manipulation, altruism, and other dynamics important in the pursuit of happiness. It is nicely paced over  episodes, in fully developing the story, but the viewer must stick with it at least halfway to get the full emotional impact of the story. Perhaps more coherent than other of the above mini series, it could be your favorite.", "Just finished watching this drama, although it's dated it's still worth a watch if you are watching Korean TV drama. I saw past reviews and it compared this show to current US drama. This is much different this show is warm, chilling and frightening at the same time. I can't believe that there are people in the world like this.This is s family drama unlike current shows on mainstream TV where coitus is in every sentence. This is different a family show that's is very emotional. Well acted, well written (a bit long). The first episode is a bit confusing as the characters are not clearly explained but stick with it, gets better with each episode.Even if you think you are not an emotional person, it's hard not to be with this show, even the music is touching and I don't even know the words. If you watch this show and don't feel sad along the way then If you are into Korean TV drama I would say that this rates very high among those I have watched, but I have a long list to get through. Although I would rate That Fool at the top of my list.As well the main actress is enough of a reason to watch the show, if you ever wanted to picture an angel she is it. I first saw her in a movie 'Cold Eyes' and I thought she was beautiful. But in this drama she is beyond that. A picture of an Angel with a smile that's warm and sincere.SPOILER ALERT: The show is a bit long seems as though that the writers wanted everyone (main cast) to have some hardship before the end, which is predictable happens. Although the end is a bit different than the other shows that I have watched (in other shows:everyone goes off on their own in the end). This show is different as it brings intertwines all the cast into situations that are semi realistic. But I thought that the witch and the witchette got of way too easy. Watch this drama you won't be disappointed, I am not a binge watcher but these dramas have changed that concept for me.", "I'm a regular viewer of kdramas, some I love some questionable. This was nice to watch but in my opinion,  episodes was too long. Sometimes by my own admittance I can have a short time span unless the story is really rivetting. Although the storyline had a good premise, I quite couldn't agree with the ending and therefore slightly disappointed. Unless there are Koreans out there can guide me, I'm from the UK, but I find, taking into account they are fictional stories but with a sense of how your culture is coming across to a westerner, alittle proud, sometimes harsh, humourous (a bit like ours) and seem to go by honour. Going back to this drama, for me thought the way the step daughter was treated in the end was quite harsh, a bit of compassion wouldn't have come amiss. Mother was a nightmare so can understand the characters turning against her. Was disappointed the daughter didn't end up with the restaurant guy, he's so sweet and lovely. The grandson's character was not very attractive at all, in real life he'd be someone I wouldn't touch with a bargepole! Lol. Well acted by everyone.", "Shining Inheritance was a riches to rags to find yourself drama that was well written and acted. Our heroine is plucky, the stepmother   stepdaughter are quite the evil pair and our male leads, the rich heir (starts spoiled and evolves) and selfless friend, are both worthy of love. The Grandmother, who has the inheritance, shakes up her sheltered spoiled family when she strips them of money to teach them about life. What I liked about the show a) writer So Hyun kyung crafted  episodes of interwoven characters with surprises along the way. His evil characters had nuances. He also wrote the top notch intriguing  Days ( kdrama) that I rate as better than Shining Inheritance. b) male lead Lee Seung gi as heir Hwan, in his first male lead role, whose evolution from spoiled heir to caring person was a joy to watch. I also loved him as the male lead in 's My Girlfriend is Gumiho. c) Yeon Joon seok as autistic brother Go Eun woo was perfect and you rooted for him to be reunited with big sister. d) loved store Manager Lee who was terse but fair and put up with Hwan's initially hostile reluctance to do his job with patient dignity.What I did not like about the show a) this drama was extended by  episodes and you can feel the storyline stretch. I bet is difficult for a writer to revamp during production when a drama is extended because it is garnering great ratings. b) the evil stepmother, while nuanced, grated on me and I tended to skip her scenes to alleviate the irritation. c) multiple hairstyle challenged characters; female lead Go Eun sung mushroom cap pageboy hair bugged me. She looked so much better with the bangs off the face. The Grandmother character had a terrible helmet head gray wig and don't get me started on the factory worker with the gray pageboy wig.", "I enjoyed Brilliant Legacy aka Shining Inheritance very much. It's from  and features a great cast and interesting story. It is available to watch with English subtitles on Instant Netflix.The actor who plays the autistic teen brother was the highlight for me in this series. He was brilliant at showing the inner world of autism. If you have a family member with autism you will definitely be touched by his storyline.The music soundtrack is perfect for this series. I wish American television could produce something as inspiring and compelling as Shining Inheritance or other top notch K dramas I have watched, like I'm Sorry, I Love You,  Days, Autumn Sonata, etc. All we ever get are boring reality shows."], "Sentiment Score": 1.0}, "766": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1187": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "625": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1374": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "798": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["Reply  aka Answer me to . Korean TV drama.  Episodes. Summer of .SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: Teenagers go through their final school years on the way to young adulthood. As adults, they reconvene in  for their  year class reunion; while there, they all reflect on their past while their history together unfolds via back story. It's primarily a life story drama about growing up.A half dozen high school kids or so are focused on throughout this show (some more than others), along with one young teacher, and one set of parents. The vast majority of the story is told from  to  and takes place against the backdrop of the birth of K Pop. The kids meet at high school, become friends, experience awkward first loves, graduate, drift apart, move on in life, etc...The remainder of the story flashes forward in time periodically until it arrives at the present, where you eventually get to see what happened to everybody involved.KTV shows come & go at such a rapid fire pace that it's virtually impossible for a viewer to figure out what's actually going to be good and what's not until a show is well into its compressed run time. Fortunately, it's fairly easy to determine if a show will be suitable to your own personal tastes right away, and I must say I quickly developed a fondness for this particular one. Reply  doesn't have an overly famous cast, a huge budget, or a massive pre air marketing campaign to prop it up, so it has to work a little a harder to prove itself, and figure out how to find an audience along the way. It basically has to rely on smart storytelling, and subsequent word of mouth, in order to be successful, and it did all of this, and then some, really well.Clearly, the best thing this show has going for it is its creativity and intelligence. It's quite well written, and the way it implements a multiple time line is highly effective; subtle hints are dropped at the current day dinner party during each episode, then it flashes back to the past to see how things came to be in the present. This method of storytelling serves to successfully further the plot while keeping you interested in the story & characters along the way. This show also refuses to pander to viewers; it's completely devoid of one note characters and typical antagonists, and it does not rely on being overly formulaic (which is a frequent problem that is inherent to this industry). Its willingness to openly deal with oft addressed topics in a thoughtful, and often hilarious, manner is rather impressive as well.The late 's early K Pop theme is frequently focused on throughout this show, despite the fact that it's somewhat irrelevant to the true heart of the story. This is all implemented exceptionally well however, and while this show could have succeeded without it, it is certainly better off for including it. There's a good deal of nostalgia involved as a result (from an array of props, to the soundtrack of that era, to cameos, period references, and so on), and, everything is nicely woven together into one seamless tale; none of it ever feels out of place, or tacked on, just for the sake of making it part of the overall story. The cast is pretty solid at getting their jobs done, and they're all afforded well rounded roles. While not unrecognizable to most fans of the Korean entertainment industry, this is primarily a very youthful cast without years & years of experience in this field. Several of them are current K Pop industry crossover stars as well, and the irony of having several actual K Pop idols portraying high school kids obsessed with K Pop is not lost on me. The lead role is reserved for Jung Eun ji (of APink fame); she could use a little more seasoning going forward as a drama star, but she is way ahead of the curve already and makes for an oddly charismatic and impressive young actress for someone who's relatively new at this. Everybody gave nice performances throughout, and they were equally believable as both high school kids and their future  year old counterparts. The two parents are even given diverse parts as well (which is rare for these shows); there are usually only a handful of the same tired old roles available to K drama parents elders (i.e. usually you're either: a rich manipulative ass, a drunken deadbeat dad, a poor sick mom, etc). Here, the parents are refreshingly portrayed as regular people going through their everyday lives as a normal middle aged middle class couple. In many ways, the parents practically exemplify what the entire spirit of this show is all about.Summary: All in all, this is a quickly paced and very effective series that I have virtually no complaints about whatsoever. It features a simple and approachable story that should resonate with a wide range of viewers; young old, Korean not Korean, male female, it doesn't really matter. Engaging, smart, funny, poignant; this is a perfect example of how good KTV dramas can be when they aspire to be more than just stylishly status quo.Bottom Line: A real gem for K drama fans that's not to be missed!  out of  stars!...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!", "Every once in a while, amidst the multitudes of Korean dramas which employ all the stereotypical clich\u00e9s such as Cinderella story lines, hapless women who have tear ducts the size of the Pacific Ocean, and men fighting over mates like gorillas, a show such as Reply  comes along to provide viewers with a breath of fresh air. I recently undertook a marathon session of this drama after many recommendations from friends, and I don't know why I waited so long; everything about Reply  is believable, relatable, and most of all entertaining. This drama will transport you to 's S. Korea, as several high school students wrestle with the ups and downs of life while dealing with one another. Reply  will make you yearn for the good ol' days of your adolescence, as well as reminisce about the golden years of S. Korea. I guarantee that you go straight to your computer and make a playlist of most of the songs that are wonderfully woven into the drama.Many different and surprisingly complex themes are explored in every episode; many of the experiences portrayed are those that you or someone close to you have probably gone through, and this drama recognizes that real life happens. One quip I had with Reply  is that some of these themes could have been developed a little more, such as that involving Joon Hee. Another issue I could see arising is that viewers who are not familiar with the pop culture of 's S. Korea could have difficulty catching onto some of the references made. This is minor, however, as the top notch acting and stellar writing more than make up for this.Seriously, just go watch this thing. The only regret you'll have after you're done is that you won't be able to watch anymore episodes.", "I like series that are set in the past and tell us how life was back then while also giving us a glimpse of events from those specific years. Reply does exactly that! \nThe first installment in the series is called 'Reply '. The story revolves around six protagonists   Shi Won, Yoon Jae, Yoo Jung, Joon Hee, Hak Chan and Sung Jae who are in their senior year of high school and are busy figuring out life after school. The main protagonist is Shi Won played by Jung Eun Ji from the popular K Pop girl group APink. Shi Won has just one love in her life   H.O.T! She will go any lengths to be a core member of their fan club. She'll skip school to stand in line for their album. She'll run away from home just so she can have a glimpse of her idol. Shi Won has absolutely no clue about life after school because she is just too immersed in her love for her favourite boy band from S.M.Entertainment. She may not be the best of students but she can come up with steamy plotlines about her favorite idol's personal life!\nWhat makes this series popular is the fact that it introduces to all its audiences, both international and domestic, to the fact that 'Fan Fictions' have been in existence since the dawn of boy bands. One of the most loved themes of the series is the rivalry between White Angels and Yellow Kies. When Shi Won finds out that her best friend is no longer a White Angel but a fan of Sechs Kies all hell breaks loose. What makes all of this even more funny is the fact that Eun Ji Won who plays Hak Chan is actually a band member of Sechs Kies.\nSechs Kies and H.O.T were the first few bands to have such large members in their fandom. The fight scene between White angels and Yellow Kies is nothing but epic but the ultimate climax is when the victor is announced!\nThe series played a very important role in bringing to the fore the foundation of the Hallyu (Korean Wave) that has swept over the world in over two decades and is still going strong. Sung Dong Il and Lee Il Hwa who play Shi Won's parents are portrayed as a couple that's always bickering but there is a definite under current of love that we keep getting a glaring glimpse of throughout the series. Who would've thunk that they would be able to take and make their characters so popular amongst everybody who watched it!\nApart from the obvious KPop theme   other aspects of High School life are dealt with very delicately. This first installment has a mystery theme. The story begins in current day  but takes us back to . We learn how the characters met and their relationship with each other is established and we also see how their friendship has progressed from  to  but in the present day of the series Shi Won is pregnant and the audience is left guessing as to who her partner is at the end of each episode.", "The first of the Reply series is a classic for the K Drama fans, but surely it's a nice watch for everyone as well. The story focuses on a group of friends who meet again in a school reunion in . While they are at the reunion, we see their lives back in school in the 's and also await for the mystery of who the female lead ends up marrying. The story is quite entertaining, with the characters being very funny and cute, and the main romance good enough, although it wasn't a big mystery for long. Probably the only problem with the series was that it had too many references on 's culture, but my subs explained fairly enough and I kind of was familiar with some of the bands that the girls were obsessed with. And it was nice to see the early K pop fangirling, where it all began. Fortunately, the back and forth wasn't tiring, as it happened only once or twice in each episode, and mostly in the beginning and ending. So  out of .", "I've watched all  versions of the reply series and this one is my favorite. I loved the characters and they did a great job! I also loved how we kept going back and forth from present to the past. I highly recommend especially if you enjoy nostalgia shows, this will probably take you back in time. I was pleased with the storyline very much although I also wished this one had a wedding sooner than letting the many years pass but I guess it's just how things worked out.

The more he goes deeper to find the truth the more he risks himself with the dangers ahead. One after another the truth come into the lights which shocks him as well as the audience.I thought it was another Korean gore movie with gangsters in it. I thought that way all the first half till the twist come into the play. But the real twist was in the last portion which totally blew me. It was attached to a flashback scene, that scene was the best turning point which flipped the movie from its originality into the new perspective.I am seeing possibly Hollywood remake here. Definitely other industries around the world will show interest in this. Because the story was very nice with excellent characters and twists. One of the best Korean action movie of the year.

The actors are perfectly chosen, especially Jin gu Yeo (Hwayi) who makes me think of Byung hun lee.Now one of the few things I was afraid of was pointless conversations that don't add anything to the story except making it boring.

And everything that they encounter throughout the film magically comes together in the end, and it's truly heartwarming. You'll laugh, you'll cry, no matter who you are. I guarantee it. It couldn't be any better!", "*SPOILERS AHEAD*...taken from a reaction paper I wrote for Social Science Class..My Sassy Girl is a  film by Korean director Kwak Jae Yong, formerly known for the straight melodramas he directed. It was based on the novel with the same title, compiled from the journals posted on the Internet by Kim Ho Seok about his relationship with a girl. The film catapulted its lead actress Jeon Ji Hyun and its lead actor Cha Tae Hyun into superstardom. It spawned viewers' interest in romantic comedies, although it was never recognized in the west.My Sassy Girl starts out with Gyeon Woo, a na\u00efve but eccentric  year old college student who doesn't have a clear direction in life. He narrates how his parents raised him like a girl, and how his parents' constantly telling him he was smart caused him to become lazy. His life then becomes intertwined with that of a bizarre girl whom he meets at the subway. She was drunk and wasted when he first saw her, and before passing out at the subway she calls him 'honey'. He was then forced to take responsibility for her, and that night he carried the wasted girl on her back all the way to a nearby motel. Hilarity ensues in the following scenes, as Gyeon Woo and the girl share funny moments together, such as hitting each other on the subway, playing squash (the ball always hitting Gyeon Woo squarely in the face), dancing in the disco with their high school uniforms on, and exchanging shoes (the girl wears sneakers while Gyeon Woo wears heels).The early parts of the film showcase the girl's bizarre attitude. The girl can be seen arguing with strangers, writing synopses of action movies, passing out after drinking three glasses of beer, and hitting Gyeon Woo all the time, telling him 'wanna die?' and using him to get her way. Gyeon Woo, on the other hand, succumbs to all the girl's whims and does everything for her. The first half of the film is filled with pure physical comedy and witty, hilarious sequences.What sets this movie apart from others is how the second half of the film, which consists of pure melodrama, is connected to the first half. The second half explains the girl's bizarre attitude and unfolds all the drama behind the girl's comedic behavior in the first half. Gyeon Woo battles a conflict with himself and finds it hard to let the girl go after 'healing her sorrow'. The latter scenes in the film are so dramatic that it 'turns grown men into crybabies' (quoted from the International Movie Database). Jeon Ji Hyun's acting versatility added to the second half's strong impact on the viewers. A very ingeniously written script turns the laughing audience into a crying one in a short span of time.However sad the second half of the film may be, the 'overtime' part of the film wonderfully concludes all the comedy and drama that unfolded in the preceding two parts. Gyeon woo and the girl go along with the sad fate that befell them, continuing their own lives. The ending (which I will not reveal, for I recommend that people watch it) could be considered as one of the greatest ones in the history of film making. It left no questions unanswered, and it concluded all the subtle hints that the earlier parts gave. It left me, and other members of the audience, laughing in tears.The uncut version of the film lasts  minutes ( hours and  minutes), quite long for a romantic comedy. But it was so craftily and carefully written that one would not notice time ticking by. Every scene in the film gives the viewers something to laugh, cry, or think about. There was no dead air in the story. The cinematography of the film was excellent, for it captured every scene perfectly, also showcasing the beautiful environment of Korea along the way. The soundtrack very much added to the emotion of the film's most significant sequences. George Winston's rendition of 'Pachelbel's Canon in D' invokes a very romantic and joyous feeling that is indeed felt in the scene where Gyeon Woo gives the girl a rose during her class (at an all girls school) while she was playing the piano. Shin Seung Hoon's 'I Believe', the movie's main theme, served its function well as the tear inducer in the most dramatic parts of the film. After watching the movie, only hearing the song brings me to the edge of tears as I remember the saddest parts of the film.Jeon Ji Hyun's acting in the film was very superior. She does very well in portraying the unnamed girl (yes, the girl's name was never mentioned) in the movie. Her very strong charm and acting versatility (she laughs, threatens Gyeon Woo, and cries in one scene) makes the film very appealing, even to grown men who grew up watching action movies. Her performance in this film shoved her into the limelight and made girls want to be like her and made boys want to be with her.Cha Tae Hyun did justice to the role of Gyeon Woo. Just looking at him makes you laugh, and his being punched, slapped and manipulated by the girl is one of the big factors in the film's success as a comedy. His performance in the film made him one of Korea's 'most wanted dates', according to a survey on Korean girls.Some of the very notable characteristics that I found in the film were: .) It had no kissing scenes; .) The girl's name was never mentioned, although she played the biggest part in the film, and .) There were no 'I love you' lines in the entirety of the film.After watching the uncut version of the film, I saw tears in the eyes of most people in the audience. I could most probably say the movie has been successful in moving its viewers.Jeon Ji Hyun won the  Grand Bell Best Actress Award for her performance in this film. Cha Tae Hyun won Best New Actor at the  Korean Oscars for his performance in this film. My Sassy Girl was number one at the box office for six straight weeks in Korea and sold over , tickets per day in Hong Kong at the time of its release in . It was the second highest grosser of that year (accumulating more box office loot than SHREK, HARRY POTTER or LORD OF THE RINGS). It was the Best Asian Film at the nd Annual Hong Kong Film Awards. Just this year, Dreamworks (an American film company) has been planning for a Hollywood remake of this film. How great could this film get? My Sassy Girl is a film close to my heart. It is not only a lighthearted comedy that delves into the culture and behavior of Asian teenagers. This movie shows that there are so many different ways of expressing your love without saying 'I love you'. It is a movie that proves 'fate is building a bridge of chance for the one you love'.", "This is my \u0084afterword \u0096 maybe it's written more for myself, but please don't mind it and my lack in English too.When watching movies we rarely know what to wait from them and the least we wait the film to affect us so hard that suddenly a completely new dimension appears to us, that the movie will make us to look on things and life from a different viewpoint, will make you to remember forgotten things. But movies like that exist, and this is one of them .Thinking about this film I start to consider what the movie makers really want to achieve creating films and what is the task for a movie. Is it a picture movie with good cameraman's work, good acting , story or impressive special effects? These things are important ,but in my opinion, in a good movie the main is the message of it. I don't know if it is the director, the scriptwriter or the crew together who made this movie to touch the viewer, made him to look with a different look, who worked to make this film to deliver the message as it is, but I can say that they have achieved their aim.This movie is humane. It's message and characters are humane. It has no meaning if the end of the movie is happy or sad   there is joy and pain both in it, because that's exactly how the life is.I liked this movie. But it is impossible for me to rate it the same it's not possible for me to rate my own life.This movie touched me. I hope that many others too.", " Minor Spoilers This film is one of the greatest Romance Comedy movies ever made, and as such, I feel I will have a hard time doing it justice with a few lines written here. The story was first seen online as an internet diary written by Korean student Ho Sik Kim. And is claimed to be based on a relationship with a girl he actually met. Yeah, that's right. It's a (mostly) true story! Then the story was bought by Korean film production company, Shin Cine. Finally, Korean director, Kwak Jae Yong, 'Sketch of a rainy day' was brought on board to direct. The rest, as they say. is history.The entire movie revolves around two main characters, 'Kyun Woo' (Cha Tae Hyun) and 'The Girl' (Yes, her name is never actually given) played by the wonderful Jeon Ji Hyun. The story begins when Kyun Woo meets the girl on a train platform late at night. See, she's drunk. Very drunk. After making a fool of herself on the train she passes out, but not before calling Kyun Woo Honey. This leads the other passengers to believe that she is his girlfriend. In turn, our wimpy hero feels obliged to take care of her. So off he goes. Well, at least half way down the platform, before dropping her onto an empty bench. But do you think he has the heart to leave her there? Of course not. That's one of the things that makes this film special. Kyun Woo may be a bit soft. He may be even just a tad pathetic, but his heart is in the right place. All he wants to do is help the girl. But... What does he get in return? Well, He gets a down right scary, weird, psychopath of a girlfriend who takes every opportunity to either A: Hit him B: Humiliate him or C: Get him thrown into Jail. Yes, she's pretty mean. Or is she? Is there more to her than both Kyun Woo, and we the audience, can see? Maybe his wish to help her is not totally unjustified.One of the greatest achievements of this movie is in it's two leads. Considering nearly the entire movie focuses on just two people. The stars did a very good job of keeping up 'very' good chemistry. These are two wonderful actors who portray all the emotions needed, and at a very high level. Cha Tae Hyun, in his first role manages to keep Kyun Woo on just the right side of Bumbling, Shy and even Pathetic. At no point in the movie does he annoy, and that's a hard task indeed. He's always laughable. Granted, sometimes you laugh with him, mostly we laugh 'At him,' but that never stops you from thinking you'd like to have him as your friend. Jeon Ji Hyun however, is just incredible. She is the best actress of her generation. I don't just mean in Korea. I mean PERIOD. She fills the character of 'the girl' with depth, charm and overall a sense of reality which in a film that occasionally becomes far fetched is an excellent achievement indeed. She is incredibly expressive. Most of the time she doesn't even need to say anything. Her face says all we need to know. Some of her expressions are just priceless, and I can honestly say I have never, ever seen them captured on film before. i'd be 'more' than a little surprised if she doesn't become more of an 'international' star in the next few yearsThe film features a wide range of genre's. Although It is primarily a Romance Comedy film, it also has a dash of action courtesy of the girl's 'Scriptwriting' hobby. This leads to all manor of imagined scenarios staring Jeon Ji Hyun. Be it parodies of 'The Matrix' in her 'Demolition Terminator' story, to an 'Ashes Of Time' style period swordplay movie later on in the film. These scenes, while not exactly furthering the plot are really well done, and a nice little break from the main story.My favourite aspect of the film is how the director gives little hints and tips as to what is happening in the story without actually telling us. Each and every small detail (Which at first may seem trivial or pointless) will come back to play a major part in the film later on. Apart from being a really neat little way to tell the story, it also makes the film nearly infinitely re watchable. You can come back to it again and again and you'll always notice something new which enhances the plot. By the time you get to the midpoint of this film you 'will' care for these characters. As it approaches a more touching, less comedic, romance angle you wont lose interest. It's clever, funny, touching and romantic.The only people who may not like this will be those allergic to romantic films. Even then, I feel you may just be surprised. I cannot recommend this film enough. If you don't watch it. You only have yourself to blame.", "My sassy girl is a movie kind of old indeed, I have it since it went out on DVD, because every movie I hear good comments I buy it, but honestly I didn't see this movie until yesterday, I saw the directors cut which is  minutes longer, so the movies reaches  hour  minutes, and there wasn't a single minute that I got bore, the movie is the perfect mix of comedy and romance, the comedy part doesn't seems to happen because of forced situations, they are more like things that could happen to your or me. The movie is son engaging that I saw it yesterday and I cant stop thinking about it, honestly I'll see it tomorrow again with some friends, because people usually do not like to watch foreign movies thinking that only Hollywood makes good movies (and that is such a mistake).The actors are cool, honestly in the beginning of the movie I tough common these  are the stars? but then you realize they are perfect, casue they seems to be  normal everyday people, not HOT STARS with perfects bodys (I ended loving that girl), the chemistry is perfect, the two of them blends together so nice that I could believe that everything that happens on the screen is real.The Score, WOW, I already had to buy it, the music was like I was playing some Final Fantasy game, That means that every music you hear fits perfectly to the scene.My only concern is the remake Dreamworks is doing, that scare me, doing a movie again just cause Americans don't like to watch movies with Asian people? bad very bad, I feel sorrow for them, I am glad I don't have that problem and I can watch this movie the way it was envisioned.One advice: WATCH IT NOW!!!

I only recently got into some Japanese and Korean shows. One of the best that I've ever seen was Descendants of the Sun.My Love Eun Dong starts off with a great premise of a young high school boy who meets a  year old girl who changes his life and how he lives it in a most profound way. It's clear that there is a love there, but she is suddenly forced to move away with her step parents. Ten years later, they meet again, and as they finally strike up a relationship, Eundong disappears, leaving Hyunsoo heartbroken and wondering what ever became of her.Another ten years go by, and Hyunsoo, who is now one of Korea's top actors, uses his fame and influence to try and find Eundong. What Hyunsoo and Eundong both end up discovering is a web of lies and fabrication by her current husband and his mother, as well as her own step parents, because Eundong has lost her memory due to an accident, and so she is given false memories to maintain the charade of what really happened. As the story gets going and becomes intriguing to the viewer to find out how Eundong will get her memory back and reunite with Hyunsoo, it suddenly collapses like a house of cards by unsympathetic and largely unlikable characters as well as too much melodrama. There's enough melodrama to fill three seasons of any regular show.I will say that the performances are very well acted, despite nearly all of them playing characters with such weak and mostly unlikable personalities.The stand out here is Jaeho. He is the only paraplegic character that I've ever seen who is about as cowardly and despicable as the worst villains in any TV show or movie that I have seen. The director tries to make the viewer sympathize with him, but he's devoid of anything approaching having good character qualities except for how he treats his son. Eundong is a woman who is unable to truly think for herself and find her own power within. She makes decisions mostly based on what others tell her to do. She suffers from being abused by others largely because she has little self respect and self esteem. She's a woman with a big heart for everyone but herself.And Hyunsoo, the character that we're supposed to sympathize with as much as Eundong, is an immature lout who barks orders at everyone, including Eundong. He's a + year old man who acts like a teenager. He has fits of temper that would turn off any woman who had any self  respect. There are a number of scenes that make you wonder how Eundong could ever be with someone like that, but after seeing Eundong's own issues, it's not hard to understand.The acting and production are well done, but the story and characters, which had so much potential, largely fail across the board. This isn't romantic or loving, as the story tries to make the viewer believe. This is about power and control, two things that have nothing to do with love. You wade through half of the series waiting for things to work out, and then finding at the end, a very empty and unfulfilling resolution, which causes the viewer to say, I watched this whole thing for this?!If you want to see a Korean production worthy of your time with memorable, likable characters, and love that has integrity and value, I highly recommend Descendants of the Sun. Don't waste your time with this one.", "I found this series on Netflix and it is re titled This Is My Love. I enjoyed the  episodes a lot.

The female lead is not pretty is only the nd lead in secret garden. Male lead is a bit too fat. But turn out the male lead's acting is superb. Second male lead act equally good.

That said, the other  episodes did not disappoint.Korean jurisprudence differs from that of the U.S., so it may take a few episodes for an American viewer to understand what the characters' roles are on the Incheon Public Safety Prosecution team that is the centerpiece of this story. I'm still not entirely clear on how they were able to stay on the cold case homicide that is central to the plot, not even counting the obstructions thrown in their way by shadowy figures in the fictitious chaebol (megacorporation), Hwa Yeong.I find myself watching this repeatedly, looking for clues hidden in plain sight that I'd missed previously. It's in Korean, a language I don't know, with English subtitles.

In life, I have had to say goodbye to many things  friends, family members, the Dippin' Dots stand I worked at as a teenager, and as I venture into my last year of my s, I say goodbye to my youth as well. Bidding farewell to Reply  continues this list, as I venture onward in dramaland and away from Ssammungdong. I say goodbye to that warm, neighborly feeling, that old nostalgia, that stirup pant wearing era, and to the best youth drama I have ever seen.Reply  outshines its predecessors. The story primarily takes place in a singular setting, and yet the narrative does not stagnate; it does not become boring or trite; it does not make you sleepy when watching daily interactions of the families. Instead, the story of R pushes at the heart and makes you yearn for friends who love each other this closely, for parents who love each other this much, for a life as simple and yet as hard as these characters' lives were. It takes you out of  and  and supplants you into  where you take that same journey with the characters. Perhaps the star of the narrative of R is its ability to exert both laughter and tears at the passing of a few minutes, yet it never feels stilted. It brings us richness and variety of character within just the five friends, let alone the parents and siblings surrounding them. With that, we see intricate details of each person's character  like Bora's unspoken love for her parents, or Dong Ryong's inner philosopher, or Jung Hwan's hidden sweetness, or Taek's competitive strength. There are so many elements of character that we see, often unspoken, rise to the surface with the passing of a quick moment or a prolonged incident.Not only did the narrative of R promote emotions from the viewer, it also brought the winds of unpredictability with it. The writers, in their infinite wisdom, flipped the switch and delivered a romance not built on the standard female lead being the only one in love for the majority of the series nor a male lead who said nothing but ended up the romantic star. It gave the person who stepped up and took a risk the chance to shine (and shine he did  delivering kisses to die for and a sweet chemistry with the lead that was noticeable from the get go). Furthermore, the show gave many couples a chance at love, both new and renewed, lost and found. It was never unrealistic or unfair to anyone in the cast (as some are quick to say); instead, it offered options and chose the best one. The laughter and tears that made me giggle until wheezing and leak all over my crooked glasses came from an illustrious cast. R's five friends gave their all to show us their characters' fears, tears, love, admiration, consternation, that random move in Baduk, and so much more. I have to hand it to Ryu Joon Yeol and Park Bo Gum; they made me root for both of them and create #TeamPolyamorous as a hashtag. Their performances were so spot on, and a new star was born. Go Kyung Pyo has always been a personal favorite, and as the sweet, slightly nerdy but quite handsome Sun Woo, he once again stole my heart  this time, though, not with laughter so much as with sweetness. Lee Dong Hwi as Dong Ryong was simply adorable; I would like to see more from him. Hyeri's Duk Seon, though the weakest of these performances, was true to Duk Seon's character  bubbly and outgoing, if not a little bit kooky. I could talk all day about the parents' roles as well. Ra Mi Ran, Kim Seon Young, and Lee Il Hwa trumped most drama mothers for being the most awesome trio of moms in a drama. They were not only funny, but they all showed signs of vulnerability and strength, and true to form, they were an unstoppable force on screen and in front of their husbands. Speaking of husbands dads, all the dads were awesome as well, but Kim Sung Kyun takes the cake. His President Kim routine will forever been ingrained in my memory, but also his relationship with Ra Mi Ran showed a great example of how love grows with age. The music of Reply  also played a special role, not only in the background OST, but in the characters' lives. From Duk Seon trying to win a Walkman to her waiting anxiously outside a concert venue, to Dong Ryong's cover of I Just Called to Say I Love You, to Ra Mi Ran's special dance, the power of music pervaded the narrative of Reply. It gave us warmth and it made us want to dance along. Even at : to  hours per episode, I'm going to watch this again. I enjoyed it too much and loved it even more. There was never a dull moment in this series, and I will treasure it for a lifetime. However, now it is time to move on  to leave the streets of Ssangmungdong  and flash forward to Dayton . I look at my neighborhood  siding coming off of roofs, puttering old cars emitting exhaust, the paint on the doors of my house chipping, and the possibility that after I leave in a year or so, it may be the last time I see my home of nearly  years. It may be the last time I get to say goodbye to my neighborhood, just as it is my time to say goodbye to my youth. For all things considered, the first  years have been a good run.

It's (spoilers) a melodrama!SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Our main lead stars as a young single civil service worker that's tired of seeing her old school friends getting married, achieve more than her, leaving her behind, etc. She thinks she's becoming one big failure in life, while everyone else she knows has gone on to bigger and better things. There's one particular close girl friend of hers that continually enjoys rubbing salt in our main lead's wounds time and time again. Finally fed up with the increasing peer pressure from her friends, and what she perceives as her own shortcomings, our young heroine eventually cracks and she one day impulsively blurts outs a silly off handed lie to all her friends that she just got married to a rich, handsome, perfect, young, hotel heir (who is the male lead in the show).Quickly realizing her mistake, and mortified by her momentary act of childish stupidity, our young lead wants to rectify the absurd situation she's created for herself as best she can, but she has her pride at stake, and the damage has already been done anyway. Rumors about the marriage soon start spreading across Korea like wildfire, and she inadvertently impresses a hugely important future business partner as the fake wife of the young hotel heir along the way. As such, the two leads soon find themselves thrust together as a result of the circumstances at hand. Our young heroine wants to impress her friends, and our young hotel heir needs to impress his future business partners, so the two of them agree to pretend to be married to help each other achieve their own goals. The two leads couldn't be more different from one another. He's polished, well to do, smart, and reserved. She's ordinary, perky, frank, and full of heart. The fake marriage & web of lies they've both agreed to implement becomes increasingly harder to maintain as time goes on, and, they eventually need to find a suitable exit strategy asap. But, of course, they've both now fallen in love with each other during their time together, so parting ways is not that simple or easy when it comes time for the both of them to do so. Our young male lead is played by Kang Ji hwan. Gosh he's good looking, and he strikes a real nice balance between what's needed to be the leading man in his role as the young hotel heir and romantic interest. There is little, if anything, to not like about his performance or the character he plays. He does a terrific job all in all, but there's no questioning who the star of this show is; that would be Yoon Eun hye. I can't stress enough how impressive Eun hye is in her role here as the earnest hard working normal girl who eventually falls for the male lead. I can't vouch for her acting range outside of this genre, but she's pitch perfect and adorable here, and the performance she gives makes her character, and this story, almost impossible not to like & root for. The two leads occupy more and more of the main storyline as this series progresses, and they make for a great on screen couple. There's a host of other side characters, some of which you're sure will morph into the main evil bad person sooner or later, but that never really happens! What passes as the antagonists in this story (the Aunt, the brother, the former love interest, the bitchy girlfriend) don't ever get around to being overly unreasonable, or become an overbearing problem that must be dealt with via typical melodramatic methods. In fact, though not without their faults or occasional schemes, you'll likely find yourself hoping these antagonists all make out well for themselves when all is said and done.This show is about as cute as can be. From the story, to the script, to the performances of everybody involved, to the soundtrack, etc. This type of stuff is not really my cup of tea, but, I must confess that I rather liked this show quite a bit more than I thought I would.If you're a fan of KTV melodramas, you'll probably like this show. If you're unfamiliar with the genre, but are wanting to check out a pretty solid romantic love story, look no further!Bottom Line:  out of  stars! Well Recommended!", "I love a mini series as a melodrama that tells a story in the long movie format, as opposed to those that tell different stories in the same setting (like Grey's Anatomy, Mad Men and to a lesser extent Damages, Breaking Bad, and Revenge that change the story at times while keeping to a general story). In this regard, I have discovered some gems in the South Korean TV mini series of recent years.The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back. This me recur in the same story. Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved. If personality dynamics are properly depicted in a valid manner, and if the production is skillful, powerful emotions can be evoked in the viewer. In this way we can live many lifetimes through movies, in our one lifetime   greatly enriching our incarnate experience. These South Korean productions (seen on Netflix streaming) are first class with excellent production and direction, some terrific casting and acting (particularly from some of the females who give some matchless world class performances), brilliant musical accompaniment, and staging. What makes these so good is the way they skillfully evoke deep emotion in the viewer. South Korean movie making is superb   world class.However, the following caveats must be considered by the USA viewer. They are subtitled and some people hate this. The South Korean cultural norms, values and sanctions may sometimes seems silly or old fashioned to the USA viewer. The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation unity   sometimes reminiscence of a old Frank Capra film.Most importantly, in order for the sometimes complicated sub plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing, and this leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people, that sometimes seem to be unlikely by USA cultural standards. The viewer may wonder at times why good but trusting people are so easily manipulated and deceived by bad and selfish people, but con artists do often succeed (just look at politicians for example). However this poetic license of improbability is needed to develop the story   just accept it as occurring even though unlikely at times. Taking these factors into account Will help you become involved and emotionally engrossed. It was hard t for me to quit watching at times so I binged watched.I would rank these as follows but tastes differ and your rankings might not agree:     (hard to say which is best)Shining InheritanceWhen a Man LovesThat Winter, The Wind BlowsSecret garden. Five Fingers. The Scent of a Woman. The Great Queen Seondeok. A Hundred Years Inheritance. Lie To me. Roof Top Prince. Dr. Jin. The Great DoctorLie To Me is a fun romantic story that shows how an innocent lie can get out of control with complicated and wide ranging effects. This is the premise of Chaos theory   a small and relatively insignificant event can expand into a large complex of effects that are totally unpredictable considering the origin   commonly depicted as a butterfly flaps its wings and the end result is a storm on the other side of the world (a somewhat misleading analogy but it illustrates the idea). Well done as is typical of these South Korean TV mini series", "Lie To Me is a  episode drama that deals about the love story between Gong Ah Jung, a Ministry of Culture official, gets entangled in a web of lies when she mistakenly lies that she's married to Hyun Ki Joon, a hotel president.The story focuses on mainly on their relationship as it develops from being in fake marriage into becoming a real couple in a romantic relationship.The Kdrama was interesting from episodes  to . But after that,it became draggy and the story written went all over the place as it tries to focus on many things instead of the development of the relationship to the next level.Too bad that the writers tried to give the viewer some so called crying moments but to no avail. It only minimized the story into a clich\u00e9d and predictable one.Should this have ended at episode ? My guess is probably as good as the guess of the majority of the those who saw it.With regards to the cast,the drama mainly relied on the main leads' appeal and screen presence when it reached episode .The plot was great before that considering that there was a story going on but not towards the end.Too bad that people may feel bored once they reached   of the drama. Anyway,I still commend both Yoon Eun Hye and Kang Ji Hwan for their great performances despite the not so good screenplay. They made the most out of the material of the drama. Overall,both performances made it one above average drama instead of a decent one.After watching Lie To Me,I should classify this is as a typical drama wherein all the elements of a Korean drama series are present.Also,it is not an exceptional one compared to the ones made by Yoon Eun Hye in the past the Kdrama classic like The First Shop of the Coffee Prince nor did it have an intriguing storyline like Princess Hours. I think that it did capitalize more on her looks and appeal just like her leading man, Kang Ji Hwan.Sad but true. I think that Yoon Eun Hye is a very talented actress.She obviously can do comedy and drama effectively.But it is about time that she does something more challenging to elevate her status as a talented actress.If top actresses like Son Ye Jin can play various roles in both movies and dramas like being a divorc\u00e9e,pickpocket thief,a young woman suffering from dementia,an adulteress and a very naive woman; and Gianna Jun can take her chances in Hollywood wherein the chance for success for an Asian actor actress is very limited unless he is an action star like Jackie Chan; I think that Yoon Eun Hye can do the same. Great actresses do not rely on their looks and appeal but on their talent and ability to take chances.The same is true for Yoon Eun Hye. She already did excel in a challenging role like playing a woman pretending to be a man in Coffee Prince,then I don't see any reason why she can't do something similar to this in the future.I hope that she does more of these types of roles in her future projects instead of playing it safe just like her role in Lie To Me.", "Lie to Me had a flimsy story premise. A woman irritated that her friend has stolen her first love, lies that she is married. What happens after that is not good storytelling.What I liked:a) Physical chemistry between the lead actors Yoon Eun hye and Kang Ji  hwan is good. Three passionate kisses (by kdrama standards)   Karoke in Episode , Coke Kiss Episode , Final Kiss Episode .b) Likable Male Lead, Kang Ji hwan is good looking and adorable when his character was able to cut loose a bit. Unfortunately the story was so uneven: he hates her, he loves her, he has to honor his former relationship, he doesn't believe her, marriage or bust, it was like watching multiple personalities.c) couple of good songs on the soundtrack.What I didn't like:a) Annoying Female Lead, Yoon Eun hye was so good in Coffee Prince, I was shocked how the character bugged me the first  episodes, was OK the next  episodes, then annoying again. Much of this was bad writing, but the actress chose over the top physical acting in the first  episodes which I had a negative reaction to. I did not find this character charming. The character seemed to cry loudly in EVERY episode. b) The story line was flimsy without providing characters to care about. No matter how hard the actors tried, there's no way they could save this empty plot.

I have only started watching K drama just   months ago and I could really understand now why the world just go crazy over K drama series. Anyways, I really love this K drama series. It is a different kind of love story where  unexpected people from  different worlds and with totally opposite types and temperament from each other, yet they were fated to end up together, no matter what life, people and obstacles were put in from of them. It is full of bitter sweet moments, many funny and hilarious events, and yet some painful and heart wrenching times too. After hours and hours of roller coaster feelings and boxes of tissues wiping off tears later, I really can say this is one of the best K drama or any life love story dramas I have ever seen in my lifetime. Plus the songs are so good too.This Korean version is much better than the Taiwanese version of Fated to Love You. The Korean version is more realistic (the main Korean guy is more older and more believable as the head of a big corporation than the Taiwanese guy   who looked too young and cute); there are so funny, passionate and painful moments too. All their cast acting are very believable, and they put their full effort in their roles.This K drama is highly recommended.", "What a beautiful drama, with the perfect mix of emotion and humour and a heavy dose of some great acting. Fated to love you is a drama that focuses on the feelings and character development, the thoughts and emotions   and that's what I thought was refreshing. The storyline was indeed over the top, with moments of deliberate cheese, excessive visual effects, and completely unrealistic scenarios, yet the story had enough heart to make it all seem completely plausible.

I hope there will be more drama like it .. six flying dragons is fascinating ..", "Being only halfway thru the series, I almost waited until the end to write a review. This show is just too good to not have any reviews up though, so here's what I've seen thus far.Many Korean dramas are based in the country's history, and this one is also. Not only did the writers pick a particularly tempestuous time period, but also father son rulers. The story so far has grabbed me from the very fist show, and there's no way I would stop watching through the entire + episodes. The story is written in such a way as to carefully craft each and every character interaction, to best acquaint the audience with all the players. Their stories are being quite intricately developed with many layers. I've found myself sad when some of the worst villains were done away with, because I enjoyed them so much. There are not so many black and white characters, as many shades of gray characters. The writers and extremely talented actors make each character so human, it's easy to forget this story is told in a different century! The entire cast seem to be the best in the field, especially the young men and women. The Lee Bang Won character, played by Yoo An in, has been absolutely astounding to watch. I've never seen such a young actor bring so much talent to a role. His scenes are some of the most compelling I've ever watched, in any movie or television show. All of the actors are superb in this series.If you've ever been curious about shows from another part of the world, I highly recommend you watch this show. It's a work of art in every way.", "This drama is just soo well written,well acted that it will make you go on a roller coaster of feelings,  episodes may appear as if it's a lot,i swear that it is faar from being enough", "I said I would never watch a drama with more than  episodes (because once I get addicted to it, I can't stop myself). However, I am glad I broke my rule for this show... I started watching it because of Yoo Ah in. After watching his other drama, Secret Affair, and fell in love with his acting, I searched for his other works. He didn't disappoint me at all in Six Flying Dragon! I actually got to appreciate his acting more in this series than his movie, Throne, due to the epic scale of this series. He was able to showcase the fine change from a young, reckless, enthusiastic man to a man who would take any measures to fulfill his ambition and to survive...even though these measure hurt himself deeply in many ways at the same time. I was particularly astounded by the scene where his father put the blade right next to his throat. Yoo Ah In amazingly showed many complicated feelings at once, desire for power, fear, determination, relief, and sorrow. He has had other scenes in which he acted as a son arguing with the father. However, this scene was by far the best.. It was like listening to an orchestra with so many instruments in harmony that you just want to stand up and say BRAVO!! Yoo Ah In is just such a talented and ...insane actor. I wish he becomes an international actor soon. He won the best actor award over Soong Joong Ki from Descendant of the Sun. I have watched both shows and like both of them. However, I think Yoo Ah In's winning is well deserved. BACK TO THE STORY.... it hurts and is painful when you watch it. It is quite realistic in the sense that it is hard to root for many characters. A friend today may become an enemy tomorrow. An underdog may become a villain. People kill each other not because they hate each other. It makes you wonder if killing is really necessary? Is it really justice? what is it all about? just like a line that got repeated several times: don't blame yourself, it is the world that's too unreasonable. Even though it had many episodes, the pace of the series was actually quite fast so audience never got bored. The series is multi dimensional. Each dragon had rich stories behind him and her. It is kind of like Game of Thrones. However has a deeper depiction of human nature than GOT. I typically am not a big fan of action scenes and sometimes just fast forward it (which I did for GOT sometimes.) However, the fighting scenes were so beautifully staged that I watched through all of them. It is hard to neglect the music in those scenes too. I also like the role of Moo hyul. When everything got so dark and heavy, he appearance really allowed audience to take a chirpy breath. Actor Kyun  Sang Yoon mastered this role nicely! The only weak side, in my opinion, is the love scenes between Bang Won and Boon Yi. Their interaction did not seem to move me as much the couple interaction in the Secret Affair. I can't feel much passion and desire in Boon Yi. OVERALL, it was a very successful series! The number of episodes may stop some audience from watching it. However, trust me! it would be a great journey when you watch it!", "The story is mainly about the founding of the Joseon dynasty with a smattering of star crossed lovers. It lasts for  episodes and most of them deal with the court intrigue and power struggles over many years but manage to hold your interest by their clever twists and turns. I would have given it nine but for some odd reason when a character first appears on screen and often subsequently they tell you their future status. If you know for example someone is going to be the king of Joseon then you know whatever predicament they face they will survive, at least until they become the king of Joseon. I did not like any of the main characters at the end because they all had serious shortcomings which is not a bad thing as it made them more human. The only character I liked and felt sorry for was Cheok Sa Gwang a deadly assassin, which sounds odd but hopefully you will understand when you watch this excellent series."], "Sentiment Score": 0.7457142857142857}, "630": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["Sly and Single Again aka Cunning Single Lady is a episode KTV drama from early .SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: Young couple gets married and sets out on their perfect family life to come. Not so fast though! Husband abruptly quits his bread winning job to try to start his own business, wife tries to support him while running the household & paying the bills, tensions rise as they fall deeper in debt with no hope in sight, etc. Eventually, wife gets fed up with what little husband is offering to the marriage, so she divorces him.A decade later, ex husband has since become hugely successful with his business startup, and this makes ex wife more than a little resentful. She sets out to get even and make his life miserable while planning to make him regret that he let her get away. In order to accomplish her task, she takes a job as an intern at his company in order to get close to him and set her plan in motion. What she fails to realize though is that he's still bitter that she didn't stick by him years ago, and he's equally determined to now make her jealous of his new found fame & success.The premise here is fairly modest and easy to follow. Two former spouses each still have some feelings, both good and bad, for the other. Now that they're older (and sometimes wiser), you observe their push and pull relationship unfold in typical K drama fashion; first they try to get back at each other for past slights, then they get over it and start to move on, then they grow to understand each other better and consider starting over together if it's meant to be. It couldn't be any more simplistic or orderly, and as a result, the first part of the show is mostly comedy drama, second part is mainly regular drama, and final part is primarily melodrama with some romance and maybe love along the way.Lee Min Jung & Joo Sang Wook play the two lead characters. Both performers are in their prime and they have no problems handling their respective roles. Joo Sang Wook is a highly amusing just to look at when he's portraying his younger self, complete with atrocious hair style. He's pretty effective throughout as his modern day eligible bachelor self, who's still a bit dorky and unsure of his feelings underneath. Lee Min Jung has primarily been taking on a number of these similarly themed K drama female roles in the last several years, and she is quite good at this stuff; she has a nice comedic touch to go along with all the other attributes expected of a lead actress in this type of role.Potentially standing in the way of our estranged couple at every turn is the  stereotypical chaebol family members that comprise this story's antagonists & other potential love interests; they include the self serving family patriarch with typical ego & pride, the carefree handsome young son who likes the female lead, and the wounded older daughter who likes the male lead. They are all pretty standard characters for a K drama; the Dad is somewhat emotionally distant and primarily obsessed with his own legacy, the son is perpetually stuck at the age of a boy trying to become a man, and the daughter can't get over a tragedy that happened to her in the past. Each of these family members is intended to be a sympathetic figure to some degree while simultaneously irking the viewer on numerous occasions.The first couple episodes focus on the leads as their younger selves, and are used mostly for background and setup purposes. Then, the two leads get re acquainted with one another again in the present where the rest of the series takes place. Things are kept pretty lighthearted and are rolling along pretty well for a while until the tone of the series begins to shift, and it's all mostly melodrama from there on in. The tonal shift was not unexpected, but it just reeks of too much familiarity that suggests it's coasting down the standard K drama checklist of scenes to accomplish in order to wrap up and move on to another show, and that is my primary problem with this show.I love the Hallyu entertainment industry in most all its forms, but I'm often baffled by how reluctant they seem to be to take a chance on something new, particularly when they would clearly be so good at it. This is especially true when it comes to Korean TV shows, as you basically have variety reality programming and stuff like this show, and very little else. I know these shows are under enormous pressure to simply churn out copy, hit a certain ratings number, and cover all the bases as best as possible...but, I can't help but think this show would have been fantastic as primarily a romantic comedy from start to finish, and, I know I'm not the only one who thinks this. There must surely be a market for KTV viewers who could do without another cookie cutter melodrama that insists on falling back on typical characters and clich\u00e9s in order to tell a story. And, if given a chance, I'm sure the writers of this show could have figured out a way to include an appropriate amount of love, loss, & melodrama without invoking the same tired and silly antagonist & love interest angles.Summary: I don't mean to come across as being too harsh on this particular show, It's not that bad at all, and I will recommend it. But, it is one of those K dramas that makes me long for the day when the heavens align to allow for each particular KTV show to just do what it does best, and leave the formulaic one size fits all status quo method of storytelling behind.Bottom Line:  out of  stars on the K drama scale.", "The synopsis of this one is misleading making it seem like a revenge tale.Instead it's a story about a couple that really cared for each other but went through hard times that forced them apart then meet again three years later. The husband is rich and successful, the wife is bitter that he found all this success while sticking her with his debt when he left.At first the wife is viewed as irrational and bitter while the husband acts like he's moved on. It took up until mid season for them to make the wife more sympathetic which is weird in this kind of drama.The ending is a bit rushed. it would have benefited from stretching it out over a few episodes rather than the confused tying of loose ends that happened but over all it's a sweet, romantic tale with a couple that really acted like they've been married for years.", "Just finished watching this show and I would recommend it. I was a bit hesitant after reading the reviews as I got some mixed feelings about it. But I would recommend it as it's: funny, entertaining maybe a bit unrealistic, but nonetheless worth watching.There are a lot of really funny one liners in the show as well as some really good discussion scenes. It's about a failed marriage so you can imagine that each side blames the other. It is worth the watch, it makes you laugh and tugs at your emotions and makes you wonder how could one person get in so much trouble.Spoiler Alert: The show starts really well, each episode builds for the next but it does fall apart in the final episode. Sure you expect them to get back together again, but it was too easy a re connection.First they tried to make it as a Steve Jobs scenario, he loses job and then creates another company (Jobs created Pixar) and then the company merges. But they ran through this concept very quickly and without much detail as to what's happening.Next the re connection with all the individuals (plots, sub plots) was so distant. What I mean it was, every one go to your neutral corners, no interaction between the players in the final episode. No connection between the different stories in the final scene. Every story (scenario) ends by itself not related to any of the others in the show. By bringing all the stories together it would have made for a bigger happy ending.", "The story is quite atypical.

Love.", "Our story begins telling the 'greatest love story' of Princess Pyeonggang and OnDal. We then cut to modern day, on a film set, creating a new take on the old love story. Soo Jung is starring as the princess, however when something is changed in the script and she doesn't know about it, she throws a huge tantrum. And so we are introduced to our main character; a stubborn and easily provoked actress, known as Korea's 'top star'. Due to certain events she drives off in her car and is magically transported back to the past into the time of the Princess and OnDal, and must figure out how to return to the present whilst trying to deal with love and war.The best thing about My Only Love Song was definitely the characters. Soo Jung, OnDal, Sam Yong, and Il Yong were all hilarious. A few of the characters I found annoying were the princess and the two guys who fawned over Il Yong but overall the characters were great. The flashbacks in the final episode really showed how much the characters had changed over the course of the series, especially Soo Jung, which was enjoyable to see. Soo Jung (Seung Yeon Kong) was the sassy main character, and although she's a terrible person, in the first few episodes at least, you just can't help but love her, especially when you start to peel away her tough exterior. Sam Yong is the small innocent character that just needs to be protected and he' so cute. OnDal seems cocky and sure of himself, but he's actually very lonely and needs support. Il Yong, the antagonist, is ridiculously in love with himself and a bit of a wimp but he's still twisted and sadistic.The plot I thought was fairly original, as I personally haven't seen any time travel K  Dramas myself. A few plot twists occurred throughout the series, although not all of them made sense and were not really explained. The best by far though was near the end when we discover the truth about the OnDal in the story and everything clicks into place! It also keeps you guessing which character will end up with who, and there is plenty of laughs and tears to be had along the way. The scene with the flowers and 'apologising in advance' is by far the cutest and will rip your heart out with feels. Because I'm a nerd and did some research about the original story about the princess and OnDal afterwards and I love that they kept so many details the same, for example, OnDal was known as 'the idiot' or 'the fool', so the show subtly referenced this by having Soo Jung call him 'dumb OnDai' lots, which I thought was cool.Other things: I was surprised by the special effects as they were very inconsistent. One minute they were really great and looked amazing and the next I was crying with laughter at how shockingly bad they were. The music was average, it didn't particularly stand out for me. I really like the whole design of both costumes and setting, I don't know how accurate they were but they were very aesthetically pleasing, especially the natural locations such as the huge river with the rocks.Overall, My Only Love Song is a fun and dramatic K Drama, the only real downside being a few plot inconsistencies. If you're a K Drama fan it's definitely worth watching but if you're new to K Drama then you might find it a bit weird and want something a little more normal to ease you in to the genre.", "\u2764Spoiler Alert\u2764Aaah...time travel, one of my favourite genres :) One of the best on screen chemistry I have seen, which makes the love story between On Dal and Su Jeong (aka Nannyeon) so immersing. I also love that the writer matched everyone together, I always felt that these kinds made the best dramas. I was afraid that the ending would disappoint, much like Rooftop Prince. Thankfully, the love story was given justice with an equally beautiful ending and did not disappoint.

So it has pretty steamy kissing scene!", "A short drama to watch, that is both funny and romantic, but there isn't much in the plot. The performances were okay, and probably that was the reason why this one didn't flop, as the story was odd and kind of idiotic at some point. But, at least, the drama was entertaining, it had it's funny moments and the romance was okay, as the couple had chemistry. The ending, in addition, as a bit of a wrap up and it wasn't as much of a conclusion to the story and that left out many unanswered questions.

Terribly written, this sequel continues with bad writing and storyline.", "Somehow, all through the  episodes of Iris , Ailiseu (original title), I was able to keep the characters straight, although Westerners have difficulty sorting faces of Orientals, and the names are tricky, too. In Iris II, I don't know who is who after a single viewing, although the performers are quite capable of portraying a character, and delivering some great stunt fighting, also.From IRIS , I think the head of the North Korean Secret Service is the same guy (but we don't see him much), but the main holdover character is double agent, Park Cheol yeong, who is imprisoned now by the South Korean Secret Service (NSS), of which he was once a top boss. Anyway, IRIS wants him back, since he (alone) knows where some nuclear weapons are stashed. There are a few battle scenes and ambushes that involve IRIS bad guys attacking NSS units, nominally to get Park back. Park is having second thoughts about his nefarious connections, however. The rest you will have to figure out. Some characters seem to be playing on both sides, which will probably have you saying, 'Boy.. he sure looks like that other guy who plays for the bad guys..'. He (or she) may actually be doing that   I can't say for sure just yet.No word on our heroes from IRIS , which, after  episodes, was destined to have a happy ending and marriage for the two star crossed lovers & protagonists of the series, when, in the final frame, a sniper's bullet ended all that. Unlike an American Soap Opera, at least we didn't get both lovers surviving with temporary amnesia! Nonetheless, I was hoping for some wrap up or concluding info on that tragic event, but the Producers played hardball, and just carried on with a new potential crisis. O, well, woe is me.IRIS II is a good shoot em up entry, lacking the scope and intricate character development of the first series (this is only a  hour movie, after all). It might give you partial closure on IRIS , but, I think it's a bit muddled: looking at the photos on the DVD jacket, I couldn't tell you any of the character names, nor distinguish the bad guys from the good.

This show aired in the summer of , and it's not half bad.SPOILERS AHEAD!I see four other people have reviewed this series already (to some wildly ranging opinions). I watch these shows all the time, and have a pretty good handle on them, so perhaps I can be of some help in providing a more balanced review. Basically, this show is standard fare for the genre; it's neither ground breaking nor spectacular, but it is mostly watchable and worth checking out if you like this sort of thing. It's pretty decent overall.Here's your story: It's late 's or early 's, and North and South Korean tensions are mounting. A group of hardened South Korean marines are tasked with infiltrating the North to kill a number of prominent military leaders at the behest of  South cabinet members and high ranking officials. During the raid, the  South leaders who masterminded the plan reverse course for political reasons, but it's too late to stop the mission. As a result, they must now eliminate the team they sent north without a trace, and they must do so at all costs in order to preserve national security and peace between the  nations.The South Korean leaders appear to be successful in eliminating their own marines. One member of the team survives the onslaught however, thanks to his long time friend in the squad who saved his life. Obliged to fulfill the wishes of his dying friend, and fearing that his friend's entire family may also be killed, he absconds with his friend's newborn son and goes on the run. This surviving team member is upset (to say the least), and he's not a man to be trifled with. He disappears into the Golden Triangle where he raises his friend's son while he rises to power & wealth in the drug supply trade. All the while, he plots eventual revenge on the  leaders back in Korea who killed his comrades in the past, and, he plans on one day using his adopted son to help him accomplish this goal. As such, the adopted son is essentially groomed from birth to carry out this plan in the future.Flash forward to  or so. The son he raised is now fully grown and inserted back into Korea. He's rich, well educated, good looking, and armed with all the training he needs to ruthlessly take revenge on the people who caused the death of his father. The  men he must dispatch have since risen to great power and are now well entrenched politically and financially, and one of them is now the South Korean President. Undaunted, father and adopted son set about their task to eliminate these evildoers one by one.Some problems arise though; the son is not the ruthlessly driven killer his adopted father is, and he starts to question and waiver on the task at hand over time. He also takes a liking to a pretty young girl along the way, who turns out to be an up and coming secret service agent in charge of protecting the president (i.e. the main target). Ahhhh!...this is a staple of KTV melodrama...everybody is somehow involved with somebody else, and all story lines & plot points intertwine & intersect with one another somehow. And every character is a rival to someone else; old against new, weak against powerful, good against evil, father against son, son against love interest, etc. How will this particular show play out these themes in the end?...Watch and see for yourself!There's a god bit to like about this show. It's often quite entertaining and fairly interesting, but it does get bogged down a little bit during its run time. It would have benefited from trimming its  show format down to about   episodes or so, but, I've been over this same ground too many times with other similar shows I've watched & reviewed; it's just the nature of airing KTV dramas, and, you're just going to have to get used to it if you endeavor to watch them.Bottom Line: I liked it for the most part, and it's certainly watchable. It is not deserving of its current lofty . rating, nor its two glowing  star ratings from the previous reviewers. But it's certainly not a  star rated pile of crap either. It's worth checking out if you have  hours to kill and are looking for a Korean style love story melodrama fix with a decent enough amount of action & intrigue. out of  stars!", "I first heard about City Hunter well before it was to be aired. I had set it aside to watch, mainly because I'd recently become a fan of Lee Min Ho (main male lead) via his previous dramas. Unfortunately, it took me a whole year before I finally sat down and watched this truly amazing drama.I was captured from the very first episode, where you witness the deaths of  Korean soldiers, betrayed by their own country. The musical score used to draw you into that whole scene is just...beautiful, and heart  breaking. It plays throughout the series, perfectly placed, perfectly timed. I began to love each of the characters and watch them progress, some of them more than others. The relationship between Lee Yoon Sung and his father is one of the core aspects of the drama. I tell you now, if you have not seen this drama, go and watch it. You will not be disappointed. I felt that it got a solid ending that wrapped up all the loose ends in the plot, and even with the romance. It left me wanting more..in a good way XD I would totally go for a second season, if the original cast remained :pFrom the astounding musical cores, the lovable characters, and engaging plot, I highly recommend this drama.", "Although this show might have started off slow and boring for me by the end I was gripping on to my seat in nerve wracking anticipation. The action was authentic and the characters completely lovable. I would like to have seen more romance between the lead couple but their chemistry either way was evident. The plot had a few loose ends and I hated the ending which left me feeling unfulfilled, but I'll forgive the makers on the grounds that I loved the series as a whole. I would definitely recommend watching this to anyone who loves the good looking hero with a hidden identity trying to save the world and protect his lady love, etc etc.", "I have always been a huge fan of movies or TV series such as Zorro, Superman, and The Scarlet Pimpernel. City Hunter has the same elements that I love in these other stories  a good looking man as the star, who has a secret identity and even wears a mask at times. He uses his wits to foil the bad guys and he is very skilled at fighting. He tries to help the innocent victims and ruin the evil guys without killing them.Usually, an episode ends on a cliffhanger, but with Netflix you don't have to wait to see what happens next.The first episode was not my most liked, but I stuck it out because the star, Lee Min Ho is my favorite Korean actor. I love everything he has been in that I have seen so far.This Korean drama is the one I prefer most, now that I have seen at least  entire dramas. They typically are    sometimes more  episodes each. Each episode is usually just over an hour, with no commercials (on Netflix). Each series is a complete story that ends when it is complete. I also like that it isn't R rated. I would definitely say it was PG . Not sure what the standards are in South Korea for rating shows.The only complaint I have is that you have to be a fast reader to read the subtitles before they disappear. I think the English subtitles are transcribed by volunteers and you occasionally see grammar mistakes, but it is still worth it to see this show.", "City Hunter had focused, intricate episodes with many surprises in the series. This series was billed as a prequel to the Japanese City Hunter manga series written and illustrated by Tsukasa Hojo.City Hunter was a tale of revenge with key bromances as the linchpins for the series: Dad (Lee Jin pyo) and City Hunter (Lee Min ho), City Hunter and Prosecutor (Kim Young joo), City Hunter and the sidekick (Bae Shik joong). City Hunter stalked, trapped, and turned over men that had done Dad wrong many years ago. The revenge was satisfying for targets   , but the death of target  was too long in coming and didn't seem enough after brutal death of the prosecutor, the impeachment of the President seemed like a slap on the wrist, his term was almost up.The romance between City Hunter and Kim Na Na built steadily then was iced by the City Hunter so he could focus on the final targets and revenge. This left the City Hunter alone and the story weaker by him not relying on Kim Na Na and Bae Shik joong his sidekick (both characters were effectively neutered for the remainder of the series).City Hunter had well written episodes that completely hooked me but the pacing, the writing and wrap up decisions of last  episodes bothered me and downgraded my overall feelings of the series to missed it by that much (very good but not great). The series wrapped with a whimper not a bang. The epilogue scenes were ambiguous and left me saying   that's it? Problems with the final two episodes: . The final target, the President, was weak and anti climactic. All the other targets had done dastardly things for greed and power. The Presidents' misdeeds did not have any impact. The President was neither villain nor hero, but rather blah and non descript. If a villain isn't compelling it drags the story down. The story the President told of stealing lunch money and not being able to admit the wrong doing when confronted, seemed to repeat itself. . The reveal that the President was City Hunter's biological father was a non event. This should have strongly rippled and impacted the characters \u2013 but no, it didn't. . Having target # (Chun Jae man) escape (who was the inside man that did that?) after City Hunter delivered him to the Prosecutor Kim Young  joo was annoying. Revenge on target # took too long and consumed too much of the series energy. . Killing the prosecutor Kim Young joo was unnecessary and harsh. It seemed to leave a shell shocked pall on all the characters in the finale episode. The out side the law City Hunter needs his sworn to  uphold  the law counterpart Prosecutor (e.g. Batman and Commissioner Gordon). . The epilogue was short and ambiguous, leaving a negative last impression of the series. Why did the mother and Bae Shik joong move to America? Did City Hunter and Kim Na Na get together? Throughout the series City Hunter stated he wanted to be able to achieve a normal life after the revenge was complete \u2013 did he? The City Hunter said that he'd come back to Kim Na Na and Kim Na Na said she'd wait for him. Did City Hunter continue as a vigilante with Kim Na Na waiting at home with dinner for him? If so, was his father's sacrifice,declaring himself City Hunter, wasted?"], "Sentiment Score": 0.6778947368421054}, "714": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "231": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "428": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "675": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["Rarely do some creative content come that deliver a truly gratifying experience and I wouldn't be wrong to say that Stranger Forest of Secrets is part of that consortium.

He's just brilliant.Music: the composition is such that it is subtle yet striking at the same time, complementing the arrangement of scenes in the drama in an aesthetically satisfying manner. The music sets the mood so perfectly, it really is pleasurable.I have never written reviews about a drama film song and whatnot before but upon completion of this Drama, I felt compelled to say a little, at least something about it.

There are many things to review to be fair, but I'll be brief...The overall story regards mass political and corporate corruption, cover ups and backstabbing. However, the story opens with something less subtle: murder.But it is how this initial murder then spirals into a plethora of lies, greed and downright nastiness that is absorbing to watch. The plot is never still, but not rushed. The characters are always fleshed out, but most have something to hide. The cinematography is on point but seductive. And the music... wow, it is brilliant (even though parts of the main theme reminded me of The Da Vinci Code bizarrely).What we have here is not explosions and car chases.

I won't mention the title of it because I don't want to give too much away. But, I very much disagree with that reviewer because as masterful and stunning as the other film is that he was referring too, I truly feel that a movie should be judged on it's own as to how well it is put together and based upon the quality of it's story, direction, acting, etc. And, this one I felt was actually quite good. It's not a Sci Fi Blockbuster by any means, so please don't expect 'TRANSFORMERS' like effects and such. No, this is mainly a powerful Police Drama along with an excellent Mystery as to what has happened to the child. Add in the nice Sci Fi elements that propel the story and I feel that you have a very entertaining movie that does an excellent job in involving the audience in not only the search for the man's son, but also the intriguing twists and turns that reveal themselves as time goes on.If you like a good Police Drama   Thriller and also enjoy some light Sci Fi elements woven into the story, I think that there is a good chance that you might enjoy this film.", "When normally I watch a movie , I set my personal opinion about it based on my sleep meter, If I feel sleep while I am watching it or I could survive till the end? even though I went slept the first day , I played the movie next day, but I did not Like the movie for the story line originality, the idea its not new, you if you watch it you clearly will guess the movie is another version of watch.

It has the brain (legal battles) and the brawn (physical fights) element, which is a promising combination if you are into action dramas. The promising plot and conflicts are able to keep the audience engaged through episodes, as they are intriguing enough. However, don't expect the fights to be that epic. There are twists, sure, but some are kind of predictable and forced. The twists are not the kind that could make you clap of awe. Then, as expected from Korean dramas, there is the romantic element. I was worried at first that this would ruin the cool prompt, but luckily, it doesn't, as it only serves as an additional sentimental watching experience. However, one thing does bother me: a clich\u00e9 couple conflict. The female lead character is at odd with the male lead, just because he keeps her in the dark for her own sake, while she instantly jumps into conclusion without considering other reasons behind his action. I'm sorry, but this is just too dumb for a so called lawyer, who is supposedly used to facts and logic. I also notice some details that don't add up, such as the female lead's inability to recognize her own mother when the mother is literally portrayed by the same actress with the only difference is the hair. Sure, the female lead was only a child when the mother left her, but there's a family picture in her father's photo studio, for God's sake! It's just too illogical, let alone since the female lead has always been longing for her mother, which normally would make her keep record of her mother's face. On top of the minor annoyance, the ending is not as epic as expected. It's all resolved just like that, making me question, That's it? Just like that?!\nThis drama is cool, honestly, but it doesn't last long, let alone until the very end. I think this could be mind blowing drama if the conflicts are prepared better.

The story revolves around two main leads trying to discover if they love each other, along with  other characters which are battling for the leads affections.SPOILERS AHEAD!The two leads are played by Gong Hyo Jin and Cha Seung Won. The former plays a washed up past girl band member just trying to stay relevant and milk her few waning seconds of fame. The latter plays the biggest star in Korea at the top of his fame.Hyo Jin is really good in her role as Ae Jung. Ae Jung has long been forgotten by most everyone following the Korean entertainment industry, and, those few people that do remember her can't stand her. Image and perception play a big part of many of the character arcs and story lines in this show, and Ae Jung's public image is that of a plain awful troublemaker. In reality though, she's just an earnest and charming sweetheart with virtually zero faults, who's just trying to get by in life.Seung Won plays the role of Go Jin. There's no two ways about it; Seung Won has a commanding screen presence; he's tall and ripped, with a deep voice and rugged features. He can be considered good looking I suppose, but he's also one downright menacing looking dude. As such, I wonder if he just takes these types of roles in order to solely avoid getting forever typecast as the ass kicker villain rogue cop etc that he appears to have been genetically engineered to play. He's quite impressive here as the narcissistic and tyrannical superstar on the outside, with a soft spot on the inside.The two other characters are played the lovely Yoo In Na and the terribly handsome Yoon Kye Sang. In Na portrays Ae Jung's former band mate who's become hugely popular in the  years since the group disbanded. She's also the host of a dating show that matches eligible Korean bachelors to various female stars. Kye Sang plays a rich young doctor that's a little slow on the up take with the ladies, and is completely uninterested in the ultra image conscious Korean entertainment industry.The story has Ae Jung and Go Jin inadvertently bumping into each other time and again. Feeling a little sorry for her, he uses his star power to help her career out some by throwing her a bone; this eventually results in Ae Jung being one of the suitors on the dating show that In Na's character hosts. The doctor is the bachelor contestant on the dating show.Meanwhile, In Na's character and Go Jin are a popular couple in the entertainment world (but are not actually a couple in real life). Go Jin slowly takes more and more of a liking to Ae Jung as time passes. In Na's character has been absorbed in the entertainment industry life for so long, that she's taken aback and soon smitten with the doctor she has to work with on the dating show that has no idea who she is and treats he like an everyday person. The doctor gets more and more inclined to select Ae Jung as his match on the dating show, because her personality and approach to life is most suited to his own. You can tell where all this is headed from there; all you have to do is just follow along to see who will be and won't be with whom, and for how long, and why.There are a number of sides stories sprinkled in, one of the cuter (although not major) ones, being the bond between Go Jin and Ae Jung's cute seven year old chunky & dorky nephew. The interaction between these  characters is pretty amusing as Go Jin continually tries to use this child to get closer to Ae Jung. At first, Go Jin (who knows nothing about children) is mostly an obnoxious and manipulative brute who frequently and openly makes fun of this kid (which he refers to as Ding Dong). Over time though, Go Jin comes to look at this nephew as his little adopted brother who he takes under his wing and gives life lessons to, helps become more popular at school, etc. In turn, the nephew becomes sort of a surrogate friend to the arrogant superstar who really doesn't have any friends of his own or anyone to confide in.This show is pretty standard fare for this genre (i.e. it's a romantic drama with a bit of humor thrown in). You'll likely find it fairly agreeable if you enjoy this type of stuff. It's a  episode love quadrangle, with a number of side back stories, and one of the characters might be dying of heart failure, so you should know by now what you're in for here if you watch this.There's a good bit to like here. The four main cast members all put in good work and interact well together, writing is mostly solid, and it maintains a nice comedic romance feel for the bulk of the series. I was not particularly fond of how this show incorporated the plot regarding the heart problems of the one character, however; it couldn't seem to decide whether this should be used for comedic or dramatic effect or how much of an integral part it should play. Also, I think they dropped ball a bit over the last few episodes trying to wrap up all the story lines, but that's the way it goes sometimes with many of these shows.Entertaining and plenty enjoyable overall...it's more than solid enough to recommend. I'd rate it in the   star range, and, I may have closely considered giving it the elusive  star rating I only rarely give out, if they'd tightened up the ending a little. Nevertheless, it is one of the better all around KTV melodramas.Final Score:  stars!", "I am a fan of Gong Hyo jin (Gu Ae Jung). She does feisty really well. I also enjoyed her in Pasta. One aspect of the plot that might be hard for viewers to pick up comes in the first scenes when heart surgery is being performed on Doko Jin(Seung won Cha). There is a Treasure Girls CD being played which Doko Jin hears subconsciously. This subconscious imprint is part of what accounts for his reaction to Gu Ae Jung, who has the song as her phone ring. I'm not sure if the other reviewer picked up on this. As with all programs from other countries you need to take into account cultural difference. Male female relationships and sexual mores are different in Korea.

However the intense climate to the movie will leave many viewers walking away head bowed and slightly traumatised by its conclusion.The movie 'The Scarlet Letter', is one of the many Korean movies that is finding an audience in the west. With Hollywood churning out clone after clone of various genre movies, this Asian invasion could not have come at a better time. It is comforting to know that somewhere creative and challenging cinema is still being produced and distributed.The story of 'The Scarlet Letter' involves a cop, Ki Hoon, who whilst investigating a murder re ignites a fling with his lover. The actual case that he is solving serves more as a backdrop with the main story focusing on the marital paradigmn between the protagonist, his wife and the lover.The idea of a hardworking cop being torn between his devotions to the one he loves and duty may not seem like the most original premise. Many a cop movie series has been devoted to such scenarios, movies like Micheal Mann's 'Heat' or 'Leathal Weapon' spring to mind. Yet what raises this movie above the average cop thriller is the frightening way Asian cinema is able to change the mood of a movie from one frame to another.This is now a hall mark of Asian cinema and is rooted in a tradition whereby genres such as comedy, horror, romance and thrillers can be mixed all together in one movie, take Japanese (Kitano) or Hong Kong (John Woo) cinema as examples. For the last fifteen years Asian cinema has been producing genre defying movies. Korea has now entered into the fray and are producing movies where suspense, romance and terror can be weaved into a narrative and still retain a sense of realism. This is what Hollywood is failing to achieve, with too many Hollywood movies reliant on staple genres and archetype heroes.After a brief respite Asia is once again paving a way for modern cinema to develop and surprisingly Korea seems to be the next port of call for the attention of the movie loving west.A difficult movie to watch, but one that is worthy of your attention.", "The Scarlet Letter is an excellent film for fans of unique cinema. Part erotic thriller, part murder mystery, part police procedure, part extreme cinema, but somehow masterfully pieced together into a single cohesive, disturbing, tragic, emotional and intellectually stimulating film experience.The cinematography, sound, music, acting, direction and script are all first rate. Although special mention must go to Lee Eun ju, who steals every scene in a breathtaking performance, which was tragically her last as she committed suicide shortly after completing this project. Obviously she was in some serious emotional pain in her personal life at the time of filming, which she has used to add a raw and real emotional depth to her character.The storyline is deceptively simple, at first appearing to be a routine murder investigation plot, based on a fairly mundane murder, however as we get deeper into the film this plot takes a back seat to the real story which is a dissection of the investigating officer's (Han Suk kyu)complicated personal life and his relationships with his wife and his girlfriend (Lee Eun ju).It is in the complexities of this love triangle that the films true power and force really take place as the characters try to manage their lives as they slowly unravel. This leads to a climax that is emotionally overpowering and disturbing, and totally unique.This is very intelligent, artistic, mature, dark, thriller.", "Before watching this film, I was quite circumspect regarding the Korean origin. Though, I was intrigued by the fact that the lead actress committed suicide shortly after. In the first part of the film, the plot is rather common  a murder investigation, a policeman's family life, nothing spectacular. But as the plot evolves, it gets more intense. The policeman's life is duplicitous, oscillating between the amenable, newly pregnant wife and a very appealing mistress  the singer Ga yee. From the time Ga yee finds out she is pregnant too, everything gets really complicated. She is confronted with Ki hoon's incapacity to commitment regarding the unborn child and her love for him develops into obsession. In the same time, during the murder investigation, Ki hoon experiments some sort of physical attraction to the the former wife of the dead man  principal suspect. In a very twisted chance of fate, Ki hoon and Ga yee end up locked in the trunk of his car, in an isolated place. The scenes are quite shocking, picturing the raw despair and the dramatic moments are so intense that you almost believe they are real. The paroxysm is reached when Ga yee has a spontaneous abortion and then begs Ki hoon to shoot her, which he does. It is worth mentioning that these scenes are very cruel and bloody. The title of the film comes up by Ga yee's confession that the name she wanted for the baby is Pearl, Hester Pryne's daughter in the novel The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. I was very impressed of the ending, in my honest opinion, the actors played excellent some of most complex and hard to imitate human feelings. If I should compare this film to other, it would be with Irreversible.", "At first I wasn't sure whether I should watch the movie because of some negative comments, but I decided to give it a try. Bearing in mind that I could always turn it off if I didn't liked it. But I was pleasantly surprised. The story was something I never saw before. Very original. The movie has quite a few twists and surprises that makes sure you are never bored and after every new discovery you want to see how it all turns out. I would definitely recommend it to anyone I know. And if you are lucky enough to obtain a copy or can buy the DVD, don't hesitate. out of .", "This is one of those films where you can't help but improvise.

Unfortunately this is no Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance or Sorum either. There are a handful of brilliant scenes in this film, including one particularly claustrophobic segment that reminded me of a permutation of Tarantino's Kill Bill Volume . Unfortunately, these moments are mired in irrelevance, overacting, and implausibility.By all means, have a drink, take the film in    but be prepared to throw a huge amount of constructive criticism at your TV.

It clearly lies on the grim side of K drama, but it's pretty solid overall & quite entertaining.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Two twin brothers kick off the show during their high school years; one of the brothers (Shin Woo) is timid and gets picked on by his classmate, while the other brother at different school is a strong willed, albeit decent, guy. The tougher brother (Eun Chang) is fed up that his twin is being bullied, and sets off to teach Shin Woo's tormentor a lesson. Unfortunately, Eun Chang ends up accidentally throwing the bully off the school roof top and is subsequently arrested for murder & sent to jail.Flash forward a few years when Eun Chang is being released from prison. Shin Woo is there to greet him with the news that their mother is now dead. It's clear the two brothers have both grown and changed a lot during Eun Chang's incarceration. In many ways, it's almost as if the two have switched personalities over time. Shin Woo is now a coldhearted, high ranking police detective, who relentlessly pursues drug trafficking crime rings. Eun Chang on the other hand, is a repentant and more kindhearted soul, who realizes he wasted some of the best years of his life on a momentary rash decision, and now has little to look forward to in the future as a result.The star of the show is Seo Jun Young, who plays both the twins (from high school on up to the present). He gives an impressive performance, and it's a good thing he did, because this show borders on being a one man play. I'm scratching my head trying to think of other K dramas that put as much emphasis on one single actor actress, and I really can't recall too many others that can even compare. Jun Young delivers in spades in his role(s), and, there were a few times I had to remind myself that it was the same actor playing both twins (even though there is virtually no effort to make them not look identical). He effortlessly switches from one personality to another throughout this show; from  young high school siblings, to two young adults who were shaped by the same tragic event, to grown brothers who need to switch personas & portray each other in order to eventually accomplish their goals. Seriously, the guy should win some award or something, or at least get paid double for all the work he had to do acting opposite himself in order to carry this show on his back.The secondary cast is effective enough, and include: the sinister crime boss, the mother of the twins, some cops, and the  female love interests. No complaints; they all get the job done, but they mostly all get lost in the wash compared to the importance placed on lead character of the show!There are a few flashback scenes along the way (usually at the start of each episode) that help better explain the history & growth of the family dynamic among the twins and their mother over time. I thought this was remarkably well done, and, it was a really creative way (due to the series' short run time) to fill in the familial back story blanks that would normally take up several episodes in other comparable, and more linear, K dramas stories of greater length.Be advised that this show is often quite bleak in nature, and there's a fair amount of violence involved. I won't go into details at length, but for a TV melodrama, it is surprising, and sometimes shocking, what this story is willing to do to some of its characters along the way. Despite all this, Sirius is still primarily a drama about two brothers drifting apart & coming together over time, and, it nicely mixes this aspect of the show within the overall tone of its somewhat darker story line.The series can get a little outlandish, but not really any more so than many other melodramatic shows. It is quick and to the point, and, without lot of money to throw around, it has to make do with a minimum of frills to make it all work. It accomplishes its goal though, and features a rare open ended finale that doesn't wrap everything up neatly with a big bow on top. You just have to decide for yourself what the future might bring for any of the characters that are still standing in the end.Bottom Line: I thought this show was exceptionally well done. It's tightly paced with an interesting story that is compelling throughout. And as with other shows of similar minimal length, if you don't like it, it'll be over before you know it.Bottom Line: Solidly recommended.  out of  stars!P.S. I'm really starting to develop a fondness for these special drama shows that are essentially a quick miniseries in the  to  hour range. I've seen a bunch of these shows in various formats over the last few years, and, I very much enjoy this approach to storytelling. I would like more please!", "There are some plot points that are arguable, but those are minor. It is the writing that outshines all in this production.Although I've only seen Iris, Athena and Phantom (i've been spoiled), but I've seen glimpses of a few others enough to say, unlike most other long winded Korean productions that are melo dramatic to say the least. Those typically run   episodes milk the daylight out of every plot turns, and character background.The   is for some extreme acting, the microphone blowing, and the overthought out title. And maybe the cinematography is almost too luscious, too caring for the setup. And for maybe min on some 'elements' of melodramaticness.The story revolves around identitcal twins and their growing up from a tragedy in their youthful days. Being only  episodes, this allow more succinct plot but the very unique inner emotions between the twins are flushed out nicely, deep down diving into the complex psych of seeing another version of yourself. And on top, being family. And on top being separated by an act of social accident.Each episodes begins with going back to the past and that leads to a particular point in that show. Well thought out. The younger twins are to me more captivating, the older one is noticeably not that old to have the emotional gut and umphhh still not beaten out of them by society yet.

The premise is innovative, the characters and their relationships very well fleshed out and the suspense present from the very first to the very last scene.It just never gets boring and every episode matters. This is a story that seemingly begins in the year  when a young Park Hae Young witnesses a girl getting kidnapped. The case remains unsolved as Park Hae Young's attempts to explain what really happened to the police are met with indifference.That in combination with a case very personal to Park Hae Young are enough to make him mistrust the police and the transparency of their procedures. He grows up to become a criminal profiler and one day he crosses paths with detective Cha Soo Hyun. Cha Soo Hyun has spent the last fifteen years looking for her missing partner Detective Lee Jae Han who was facing criminal charges for bribery extortion. After  years of no trace we finally get a clue of what happened to Jae Han when through his old, non functioning walkie talkie he communicates with an understandably confused Park Hae Young. Jae Han from the year  reports that this will probably be his last transmission, that the past can still change and that Park Hae Young just has to convince Jae Han from . And that is how a strange partnership who evolves into a caring and close friendship that transcends time begins. I cannot describe properly how much i love this show and the main characters who despite their tragic pasts never give up (which is the main teaching of the story) and continue to fight forward through a system of injustice so that other people will get to have what they themselves had been denied.All three of them were hardened by life but never lost their humanity and their ability to care. Their relationships also make me SO emotional. Especially the unusual friendship between Park Hae Young and Lee Jae Han who until the very end never meet properly and yet they grow to love each other so much.For me the most powerful and downright heartbreaking scene was when (MAJOR SPOILERS) they were both going (again seemingly) through their final moments and we had a flashback to their dialogue when each wished that the other would be happy. Ofc the romantic sl was also beautiful. Very subtle and yet so important. Cha Soo Hyun waiting searching for the love of her life for  years to finally be the one who will motivate Jae Han to fight for his life.

What an excellent casting choice for sb to play the DEVIL reincarnated (like for real, he's evil through and through).

It's basically a musically themed melodrama about some young people.SPOILERS AHEAD!The story centers on the prestigious Kirin Arts Academy; a school devoted entirely to taking young talented performers and turning them into future star musicians, dancers, singers, etc. It's not easy getting into this school, but if you do, you'll be trained night and day to realize your potential.Enter our young aspiring artists. They come from differing backgrounds with varying experience and talents. They all try out to be accepted by the school; some make the cut and some don't for various reasons. One girl that fails to get accepted is given a chance to earn a special exception if she can bring in a couple of other students one of the teachers wants to train. Everybody soon converges together, and the story quickly focuses on the  young primary characters;  girls and  boys, some of which have made the cut, and some of which are trying to get in through the back door.The characters are forced to get to know each other, and have to work together to accomplish their goals (or work against each other as is sometimes the case). Some grow in life over time as individuals, others fall prey to the emotional pitfalls of success and failure. Along the way, some friendships are born and others are crushed, romantic interests are explored, and so forth. This is all very typical stuff for this type of genre, and, it's done competently enough to be a solid melodrama all on its own. All this is set against the backdrop of their individual talents & the arts school though, and, that is where the show really shines.Prior to watching this show, I already was aware that the  lead characters were actually fairly accomplished young musicians, dancers, and or singers, in real life. There's a number of musical set pieces and performances throughout the show, and the  leads had no problem delivering the goods in that aspect when called upon. Actually, I was much more concerned if these people could really act, than I was worried they'd be able to pull off the musical numbers. Amazingly, they're all more than acceptable actors and actresses in their specific roles, and some of them gave quite good performances in regards. Overall: Fantastic Job Everyone!I wouldn't actually classify this show as a musical; there are only but a few song & dance numbers (if that many) that spontaneously break out. Almost all of the musical performances are done within the context of story (i.e. during practice, stage events, try outs, scheduled performances, etc). There's also only a handful of instances of one of the cast members singing to another one, but that's about it. The way the musical performances are incorporated makes for real nice blend to the overall story. Neither part of these differing show aspects interferes with, or outweighs, the other; this is an important part in making this show work successfully as a whole, and, it was all handled with a good deal of aplomb throughout.There's a number of other secondary characters and story lines during this show's  episode run. Other artists come and go as guest stars, the school and teachers are focused on some, people's lives and families are looked at, etc. It's mostly all serviceably to effectively accomplished.What could be improved here?...not much (if anything). Asking to tone down the melodrama a bit is just not going to happen with these KTV shows, so deal with it. I suppose the production company could spring for some space heaters for everybody on the set of a winter time KTV show in order to keep their young stars from freezing to death.Bottom Line: This show is definitely geared towards a younger audience than I, but that didn't stop me from liking it anyway, and, I liked it a lot actually. It's enjoyable, and, it is quite good overall. The cast and crew of Dream High II has certainly got their work cut out for them if they want to be on par with this show. out of  stars!...Well Recommended!", "I loved this K drama about high school kids pursuing their artistic dreams, and I'm a  year old woman! The soundtrack was awesome, and toe tapping, good for dancing! I even bought the CD on Amazon. Dream High was on Streaming Netflix but for some unknown reason they recently removed it. I am so glad I got to enjoy it before it was taken off! You can still see it on the DramaFever website but it's not as much fun when watching on a computer instead of a  inch HDTV   plus unless you pay monthly on that site to take the ads off you are interrupted with them on DramaFever every ten minutes. Annoying!I particularly enjoyed the story of the fat girl who lost weight in order to be taken seriously by her peers. Her transformation was beautiful.The boy I liked the best ended up winning the girl in the end, but that was hard because the other boy was very nice too. I felt sorry for his character, he was obviously still in love with her.Apparently there is a Dream High  sequel but none of the same cast returned so I will not be bothering with that one. I am not sure why they bother doing that    bring back the same cast whom people felt close to the first time around.", "I'm not good in writing reviews, but this dorama was brilliant so I decided to write something about it.First of all   the plot is good, the casting is BRILLIANT   all the characters fit their roles for %, the music is very very good, performance, makeup and costumes are good too. Thus all this in a bunch makes this dorama really exciting. Honestly, I see this 'sitcom'  dorama as the best in the line of all the musical series, I've seen in my life (I'm nearly , thus I have some experience in it :)) THE STORY: It's a story about  students of Kirin High School of Art in Seul   the school for pop talents   dancers, singers, composers. It starts from showing a girl (Go Hye Mi) singing opera on a stage. Next, we see shy girl (Yoon Baek Hee), acting like a Hye Mi's fan. She's Hye Mi's admirer and friend. Later it appears, Hye Mi's father went bankrupt and run away of the country, owing some money to mafia. Mafia tries to get the money from Hye Mi and this brings her from the way of opera singer to the Kirin school. Next we see Hye Mi's teachers (Kang Oh Hyuk, Shi Kyung Jin). Also we see future Hye Mi's friends   violent Jin Gook, country man Song Sam Dong, cool dancer Jason and strange person in a sushi costume (Kim Pil Sook). Hye Mi and Baek Hee will try to pass the entrance exams to Kirin school. Hye Mi will fail, but the school principal will open a special class for the students (and a teacher), who, by his opinion, worth something. Thus it is just the beginning of the story.Try to get it and see by your own eyes :)", "Dream High is a captivating musical drama that focused a group of young students of Kirin High School and their passionate journey through music to fulfill their dreams overcoming all the haphazard of life under the guidance of some motivating teachers. And the drama was simply moving and touching in many senses with fantastic music score. Some plot holes can be overlooked being mesmerized by the realistic plot line and natural acting. From the third episode, I really got into the drama and it was overall so interesting and heart warming. Tough but emotional character Go Hye Mi (the then newbie actress Suzy Bae quietly succeeded in turning out the main character, she's an awesome singer too), her follower friend Yoon Baek Hee, fatty but cutely Kim Pil Suk (IU) (both of their transformation are quite interesting),helpful and caring guy Jin Guk (Taecyeon was so lovely and matured in that role), music prodigy country boy Song Sam Dong ( cool alien Do Min Joon of My Love from the Star was a way too crazy!), , handsome Jason, inspirational guide   teacher Kang and also the other supporting characters were touching at least for some moments . At some times, the plot seems to get too melodramatic but I enjoyed the drama till the special concert whole heartedly. It was an attractive display of modern Korean music and dance too. Nan kkumi issoyo. Khu kkum eul midoyo ( I have a dream. I believe in that dream)  then hard effort is imperative to fulfill any great dream. We can be in ease in handling difficult situations just by smiling at fears. A good teacher is like a light house. In ups and downs of life, family and friend support can turn out to be a great relief. And after taking a decision, don't regret over it, you've a chance to prove it the best!  these inner morals of this drama are easy to say, tough to implement in real life but obviously these have made the drama ultimately inspirational , moving and memorable . Just to mention, I watched the impressive first season only and don't have any wish to watch the second season with totally different cast. :)", "I am not used to watch Asian dramas, I'm from Brazil and all I'm used are the TV shows from my country and some from Europe and the USA.But I got curious to check a little more about a foreign country from the other side of the world.When I first read some thoughts about this show I was expecting a story about six teenagers going into some trouble to get into an art school. But it goes far far away from that, in the very beginning I got a little upset about how things were taking place...But in the middle things started to be clearer and I can say for sure it is not only about six young dreams coming true, but it is the path they follow with the help of their family, friends and teachers.Yes, for me, the main plot of this TV show were the teachers, the students starts to follow what they believe and things happens not as we like in the middle, but as soon as it gets to the end you start to realize the values involved in everything.I am fascinated about what I just watched, I never wrote a review before because nothing has really touched me like I felt right now when I saw the ending.It is millions of time worth it to watch, you will see some of the Korean society cultures involved, you'll see some dreams coming true, others getting lost in their way, and most important, you'll see people rebuilding their path because they believe it is possible to dream and pursuit the happiness thru the realization of their dream.And I have to confess, everything is sooooo different from what I was used to, like if I'm not wrong, you'll see only four kisses, a very nice ones, very subtle and very beautiful... and you'll see a lot of crying and tears (like those I have right now)... and this is something I don't understand, why so many tears? This is something I don't see in dramas around here, but it might has a strong meaning for Koreans, because it is probably in every single episode.Once again, if you want to get touched, if you want to understand values of life, and of course, if you love music, you have to watch this, I promise, if you're a human being, it will touch you somehow.Enjoy and my best wishes for those who made this drama available."], "Sentiment Score": 0.6}, "1330": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "694": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["How can a drama this good, end like a dog shI really hate how they handled the ending, like what the actual f was that.

But the main interest is the bulling. In this drama, it is handled carefully. showing all the forms that is can take and all its results. And for me, that was the best part of the drama. The love story, actually the love triangle that it develops between the girl, her sister's best friend, and the outcast of her high school, is really good, but it fails to be completed, as the final episode leaves you a little confused.

You have not experienced bromance until you have experienced Eye Candy. Each member of the band had distinct and consistent interactions with each other band member, and each had a complicated personality and history with a compelling story and real growth. The band as a whole goes through its own story arc which is deeply satisfying. The side characters were well fleshed out as well, and went on their own personal journeys.

The show dared to ask is a jolt of fame enough and what's next. What I liked about this drama: a) Intriguing band members that evolved throughout the series. First, initial leader Joo Byung hee was compelling, a true free spirit that swept the others into his dream band, Eye Candy. Second, the next leader and lead singer Kwon Ji hyuk, with his laser beam eyes and desire to honor his friend's dream didn't make the right choices every time but his passion for his band family drove this show. Third, lead guitar Lee Hyun soo smoldered with desire for success tempered by loyalty to his family (blood or friends). Fourth, drummer Jang Do il was quiet and kind with gorgeous hair anyone would want. Fifth, bass guitar Kim Ha jin loved women and tended to speak without thought but was centered in caring about his band of brothers. His old married couple friendship with the keyboardist was too cute. Sixth, keyboardist Seo Kyung jong was the sweetest and willing to intercede to simmer the others down. b) Heroine Im Soo ah was independent, with a quiet spunk and was not a doormat once she fell in love.c) Rich storyline. This story wasn't only a band trying to find fame and beat their rivals; it was about friends honoring a friend, a band dealing with the music business' machine, and their exploration of their individual needs while being loyal to each other. Where each member ends up at the end of the series seemed right. d) Downloadable music. The two primary songs, Jaywalker and Wake Up (my favorite), were catchy. Not as many Eye Candy songs as I expected. What I didn't like about this drama: a) Long time groupie Bang Woo kyung, irritated me throughout the series. b) Bassist Park Pyo joo for the rival band, Strawberry Field, was a bully that never learned a darn thing.", "Surprisingly, even though the summary of this drama doesn't do it justice, this drama was actually quite good.

Through that, they get an entertainment company's attention. Okay, I know the story doesn't sound as something amazing, but in general it is very good. Actually, the only thing that bothered me about this drama was the way it was filmed.

We figured the rest of the series would be the same, but it got kind of repetitive after a while; the same music cues repeated endlessly, sometimes inappropriate for the scene, and almost always overly sentimental. They milked the Dickensian plot for twenty episodes, and it got kind of stupid after a while, but you get hooked because you want to find out who the killer was, who ordered him to kill the mother, etc... The humor (a lot of it unintentional) also kept us watching. It was aimed at a younger audience, so there was nothing in it that wouldn't fit into a G rating.

Meeting in the One More club, a club where members take on a new challenge every week, Dojeon and Hana face club drama and potential romance together.Truth be told, I only watched this as I bias Xiumin, and I finally wanted to watch his web drama after watching his movie (Seondal: The Man who Sold the River) and falling in love with his acting. The two roles are very different and far apart from each other, and I wanted to see how well he managed to take that on. Being his first drama, and both his movie and this series being filmed whilst he was a rookie, I have to say, I was blown away. To be a rookie actor and to turn around what he did with Dojeon's character was absolutely wonderful. Dojeon is a character you can really relate to, or I can personally as someone shy and similar to his characteristics. The acting overall in Falling for Dojeon is brilliant. I felt like all the characters were real people, not just people being played by actors, and they all felt like you could just walk outside and bump into them on the street. The storyline was really sweet, and to see how everyone matured and developed over time was lovely to see.The only qualm about this I have is that it definitely could have been much longer. Although it was well paced out for how long it was, there was a lot more that could have been done with this show. For the most watched web drama of , it would have been nice to see a follow up episode series after the final episode just to close up a few plot holes and such.

One of the big advantages of these shows is the fact that they are series that usually run for just one season. As so many shows these days get cancelled on cliffhangers, you don't run any risk of that happening with a K drama.The series i am about to review, D Day, is one of those shows you just have to binge watch. Yes, it really is that good. In D Day the capital city of Seoul gets hit by a violent earthquake. It then focuses on the brave men and women of the rescue services and a hospital that are left behind to deal with the effects of the aftermath.Let's first talk about the special effects on this show. Usually effects on TV shows are mediocre at best, simply because of budget restraints. However that was definitely not noticeable on D day, because when the earthquake strikes, it can stand up to the effects used in big Hollywood blockbuster movies. Even more striking are the effects that are used more subtly throughout the show, like small cracks on roads and buildings. All these help to make you believe that there really has been an earthquake that destroyed most of Seoul.However it is not the effects that makes this show so great. No that right is reserved for the wonderful cast of characters and the actors that portray them. Every single character, from the main characters to the lowest sub characters, has it's role to play in the unfolding drama. The lead character is doctor Lee Hae Sung, a doctor who is known to be reckless in his pursuit of saving human lives. The natural charisma of him (a credit to actor Young  wang Kim) makes you rooting for everything he does all throughout the show. He is soon joined in the series by the young female doctor Jung Ddol mi, another character you will fall in love with as the series progresses. She provides most of the comic relief, a thing that is well needed in what would otherwise be a pretty bleak and depressing show. The list of characters is very big and to name them all is just not something i am going to be doing here. However my review would not be complete to not at least mention the hospital director Park Gun. I don't think i have ever seen a person that i hated more in a TV series than this loathsome man. Trust me when i say that you will come to hate him as well. But oh wow, is he played well by actor Kyeong yeong Lee.The series will take you on a roller coaster trip throughout a total of  episodes.

This is the country of complete oppression. In 's we saw North Korea as a poor but hopeful country. In fact, many Koreans living in Japan returned to North Korea to join the building of paradise on earth. But since then, the country kept going downward. Nowadays they are isolated at the dead end. The reason why such country still survives is that by giving people at the power side extreme privilege, so that they want to keep the regime made of fictions.In such a country there is a family of the father, once a hero of soccer team, and his loving wife, and their son who likes soccer too. The atmosphere of the family which is poor but tied with love emphasizes how loveless the country is.In fact, looking at the officials of the camp or boarder security, I could not help wondering if it is possible for the same human being become arrogant and cruel like this. I feel some sense of impotence, because I can do nothing to the situation close to my country.This movie focuses on the fate of a family. This is beyond a propaganda movie to accuse North Korea, nor to glamorize the rescue group. This portrays the dignity of human being.", "I saw this in Korea over the summer () at a special preview screening with English subtitles.It is a very powerful story that aims to depict the plight of ordinary North Koreans in the face of sickness, hunger, poverty, oppression and, inevitably, fear. The production is excellent, and the storyline is very believable   well, it is based on real events! In fact, you'll find many of the topics covered in documentaries made on N. Korea over the last  years   particularly those that include secretly shot footage smuggled out of the country. While there are elements of sentimentalism, it isn't overdone as it is in many Korean movies.However, there were a couple of minor annoyances:. The bible cropped up early enough in the film, and I thought: Oh no, the director is going to spin some pro Christian message later on, but while this thread is returned to later in the movie, it is pretty much left hanging.. The makers of this film couldn't resist making the main character a a former footballer (soccer player) of some repute. This was totally unnecessary and distracted somewhat from the credibility of the content. This needed to be a movie with ordinary characters in what is simply an extraordinary, but common, predicament.Nevertheless, despite these small annoyances, the film gets across its main tenet, and should leave no viewer unmoved.", "Initially, I agreed with one of the previous comments about the ex football star background of the protagonist. The tidbit seemed cheap, unreal, and less authentic. The more I thought about it though, I suspect that the choice was made for two reasons: ) to make the protagonist appeal to the rest of world, especially South Koreans, by creating this common interest (football soccer). I think the world has a hard time relating to North Koreans. Americans and some South Koreans have this phobia of communist countries. Furthermore, North Koreans have been in a hermit state for a very long time. Very little is known or seen of the North Korean citizens themselves. The football thing was a simple way of making people realize that North Koreans are human beings, and in some ways they're just like us. ) to show that the protagonist was not against the North Korean government. Well, at least not outwardly. I think this film did a good job of staying away from direct commentary on the N.K. government. Yes, the film paints the government in a bad light at times. That really can't be helped, as many of the scenes are based on true accounts. However, not once does the protagonist start ranting about how his government failed him. While there is heavy censorship in North Korea to speak against the government, the film could have had the protagonist 'think' these thoughts or discuss them safely with his family   but it didn't. The main problem that the protagonist faces   and that many North Koreans face   is not that he resents his government (although, we like to think North Koreans do). His problem is that his family is starved, sick, and unable to find help in a country that lacks resources. For those two points, I have to applaud the film. I think it made a sincere effort to do what's best for the cause   North Korean Human Rights   and not just focus on what's best for the art.If anyone is interested in learning about how they can help, you can search the web for The Chosun Journal, U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, Liberty in North Korea, or Amnesty International's page on North Korea. Like any cause, donations are very important. But unlike most causes, I think the biggest challenge for N.K. Human Rights is that most of the world (and concerning, most South Koreans) ignores it. I hope this film succeeds in bringing more awareness to the plight of the suffering.", "Just saw this film at the PSIFF and was on the verge of sobbing. While I didn't forget how fortunate we have it in the U.S. compared to much of the world, this not so gentle reminder of just how bad things are in other parts wrenched my heart. Beautiful cinematography in such an otherwise ugly backdrop and overall setting. Outstanding acting performances support a movie of consistent pace and passionate portrayals. As I'm trying not to provide spoilers, let me just say you might consider bringing a handkerchief and you will likely go home to hug your young kids (if you have any) once the movie is over.

They fall for each other but the lie stops their romance. He eventually confesses, she is a doormat and accepts this huge deceit with ease. Their romance is the best part the show. They have chemistry and work hard to be likable. The middle episodes are their best. Unfortunately the story line is littered with annoying characters and plot decisions that pull entire series down. What I liked about Personal Taste:. Lee Min ho as Jin ho. He has loads of appeal and the camera loves him. His character starts out as a cold fish in the initial episodes, warms up nicely in the middle, then is an idiot in the home stretch until the final episode epilogue where he sparks up again.. Son Ye jin as Kae i. She has excellent chemistry with Lee Min ho and they clicked as a couple. Her doormat character was annoying in the initial episodes, cute and charming in the middle, then a bit sad in the final episode where she offers him blind trust in the form of herself. The emotional payoff is in their epilogue scenes.. Jung Sung Hwa as Sang Jun. He is Jin ho's friend. He is funny impersonating Jin ho's gay lover. I was horrified that the writers pair him with the despicable In hee in the final episode, lazy storytelling.. Ryu Seung ryong as Do bin. As the quiet, lonely director, this actor embodies this character with human kindness and is an emotional touchstone.What I did not like about Personal Taste:. Wang Ji Hye as In Hee. Supposedly Kae I's friend but she is selfish, willing to use and abuse to get her way. This annoying character had no growth during the series. . Ahn Seok Hwan as Yun Seop (Chang Ryeol's Dad). I loved this actor in Delightful Girl Chun hyang but here he portrays a one dimensional annoying character that sneers, bribes, and bullies his way through life.. Choi Eun Seo as Hye Mi. Another annoying character that believes she has a chance with Jin ho. Worthless and whining, the script this character was given was a waste.", "Personal Taste is a story about a guy who pretends to be gay in order to become a roommate of a female friend,who is still characterized by innocence and naivety. Jeon Jin Ho is a straight guy who pretends to be gay in order to become a roommate to his female friend, Park Kae In. His hobbies include organization and ironing, and he's known for his stoic poker face. He's a stickler for cleanliness, but he also has a talent for figuring out a women's feelings. Kae In is very trusting even though she has a habit of being betrayed. However that doesn't stop her from giving people the benefit of doubt and Jin Ho is no different. How will Kae In react when she finds out that her gay roommate is not actually gay at all and that he has fallen for her?It touches issues such as maturity, being organized and creative, how to hold onto life when things don't go one's way and how to become successful in business. The leads have the greatest of chemistry. As usual, the great Son Ye jin continues to amaze while Lee Min Ho can stand on his own amidst the great actress. The story is a good one and a must see especially for Son Ye jin fans. Check this out.It definitely good entertainment.", "This was a stellar series. I have seldom watched anything that gave me as much true enjoyment. Right up till the ending...The first   were pure heaven. Gae In mistakenly assumes Jin Ho is a homosexual, and he allows her to continue thinking that so that she will feel comfortable renting out a room to him. The two overcome their differences, becoming friends, and eventually develop romantic feelings for each other\u2014much fun ensues. This section of the series had endless amounts of charm, warmth, comedy, and romantic tension. It always kept me guessing and avoided clich\u00e9s like the plague.Then, in episode , the cat came out of the bag\u2014Jin Ho was not gay, he loved Gae In, and wanted be loved by her. At first I thought, This is good; we get to enjoy seeing them together. However, I found that Personal Taste lost a lot of its peculiar charm at this point\u2014 it became another when will they have sex story. Still, it gained another kind charm. It became the story of a man and woman who were trying to make their relationship work, about two lovers who were trying to figure out how deal with past wounds and personality flaws, about two people respectfully combating parental disapproval, about a man lovingly waiting for sex until his woman was ready. Again, the series steered clear of clich\u00e9s.And then we spent the last three episodes on a completely unnecessary clich\u00e9d plot twist\u2014guy decides he should convince girl not to care about him, so guy treats girl worse than he ever treated his enemies.One of the things that made this series really great was the way Gae In and Jin Ho argued. They would get upset and say things they didn't mean, but then later apologize. It was realistic and compelling, but in the end the creators threw this away with both hands.Another thing that was great in this series was that Jin Ho spent a lot of time teaching Gae In to respect herself and not let people trample on her. However, in the end Gae In goes to Jin Ho and finally sleeps with him, though he has treated her like dirt, saying I will trust you no matter what, even if I get hurt. This completely went against everything that came before. I personally think that it is good to wait until marriage to have sex; however, I realize I am in the minority. Still, the series had led me to hope that the consummation would at least be happy and loving, but it was just sad and depressing.To add insult to injury, the creators left most of the subplots hanging in order to spend three episodes on this ghastly clich\u00e9, and then wound everything up quickly, saccharinly, and unrealistically. A very, very poor finish to a great story.Yes, I understand this is a romantic comedy, but there is no law stating that romantic comedies have to be dumb; and this one had constantly shown itself to be so much more. A sad waste of excellent writing and acting.So, if you read this and think you are like me, you might want to stop watching this series after the first  minutes of the th episode.", "This series really hovered between being so bad its good and being just plain bad.

The romance is so cute, as the chemistry between the two leading roles is great. You can sense it from the beginning that those two are either going to kill each other or fall in love. And they almost do kill each other! The side stories weren't that great, as they were there only to fill the gap between the scenes and they merely helped the development of the story.

The driver who hit the car, actually aimed at killing both father and child, however the main actress was present and even though she was intimidated into not going to court to testify whether the accident was no accident, she did go.

It has the brain (legal battles) and the brawn (physical fights) element, which is a promising combination if you are into action dramas. The promising plot and conflicts are able to keep the audience engaged through episodes, as they are intriguing enough. However, don't expect the fights to be that epic. There are twists, sure, but some are kind of predictable and forced. The twists are not the kind that could make you clap of awe. Then, as expected from Korean dramas, there is the romantic element. I was worried at first that this would ruin the cool prompt, but luckily, it doesn't, as it only serves as an additional sentimental watching experience. However, one thing does bother me: a clich\u00e9 couple conflict. The female lead character is at odd with the male lead, just because he keeps her in the dark for her own sake, while she instantly jumps into conclusion without considering other reasons behind his action. I'm sorry, but this is just too dumb for a so called lawyer, who is supposedly used to facts and logic. I also notice some details that don't add up, such as the female lead's inability to recognize her own mother when the mother is literally portrayed by the same actress with the only difference is the hair. Sure, the female lead was only a child when the mother left her, but there's a family picture in her father's photo studio, for God's sake! It's just too illogical, let alone since the female lead has always been longing for her mother, which normally would make her keep record of her mother's face. On top of the minor annoyance, the ending is not as epic as expected. It's all resolved just like that, making me question, That's it? Just like that?!\nThis drama is cool, honestly, but it doesn't last long, let alone until the very end. I think this could be mind blowing drama if the conflicts are prepared better.

She was marrying a rich gangster for his money, yet Mu hyeok, still deeply in love with her, risks his own life to save hers when an assassin shows up to kill the wedding couple.The doctors cannot remove the bullet in Mu hyeok's brain, and they give him only a few months to live. The woman he saved gives him a lot of money and tells him to return to his homeland of Korea to die. He goes and makes a search for his birth mother whom he believes gave him up for adoption because of financial hardship. When he finds her he is shocked to discover she is rich, has another son, and so he doesn't reveal to her his identity but instead plans his revenge on her.Along the way he discovers he has a twin sister, and he falls in love with a gentle girl named Eunchae Song who works for his step brother. Over time he begins a mellowing process. Will he cling to bitterness until the end of his life, or will he find the grace to forgive those he believed wronged him?

Very few scenes were a little\nI loved the fact that unlike most serials which would end with episode , this serial will always stand out for producing episode  and .", "Well, how about wonderful ? or even a simple wow ? Please let me expand explain....\nSince I started watching K Drama about  months ago, I've gradually wondered if I'll ever get to see a perfect show. A ten out of , if you will.\nYes, I've seen the acknowledged fan favourites ( Weightlifting Fairy, Secretary Kim, I'm Not a Robot, W, Strong Woman ) and though there is brilliance in all of them, none warrants a perfect score.\nI don't use the word euphoria very often regarding the media ( probably, for TV, during the heyday of the sublime Breaking Bad ) but It's certainly apt for how I feel about  But . Entwined with that feeling is the emotional impact : I find myself thinking of certain scenes and tearing up because they're so well written acted. Basic equation : Great Art = Exhilaration !\nI recall trying to watch Sister Is Alive recently & giving up after  episodes because most of the characters were horrible. With  But , all the main cast are lovely & it's so enjoyable to spend time with them.\nPivotal to everything is the charming & wonderful Shin Hye Sun as the talented young violinist Seo Ri, stuck in a horrific traffic accident who wakes from a coma at the age of  with her youth stolen and a virtual orphan. Yes, the scenario is somewhat manipulative yet the story is intriguing and touching nonetheless. It's a truly heart breaking yet nuanced performance and I constantly wanted to reach through the screen and give her a hug ! The boy who might've saved her but for random chance is unfairly devastated by guilt from then on, though when she re enters his life he has no idea of who it really is and Yang Se Jong as the adult man is equally great as poor Mr Gong. It does hurt when he speaks to her harshly early on yet we know why and don't hate him. He's in a zombie like coma of sorts, and to see him come out of his shell as his affection for her deepens is profoundly satisfying.\nSuperb support cast ? Check ! Ahn Hyo Seop as Gong's nephew Chan is sweet and caring with a huge heart ( his  rowing friends are also good value ); Ye Ji Won is terrific as Jennifer the eccentric housekeeper & even Seo Ri's musical rival is not the one dimensional horror she might've been in another show. And....the people playing the leads as teenagers are delightful.\nThat said, the script is the engine that drives any movie or TV show and this one is extremely impressive on various levels. Pacing symmetry is tip top. It's also very creative, skilful and thoughtful in terms of action & dialogue and carefully building the central relationship. Many scenes are supremely memorable ( eg Choco Pie, onions, fountains, Seo Ri moving out to name just a few ), plus there's ample humour & a pleasing affection for the joy of music. There are feints and trickery, and I was pleasantly surprised with the choices made in certain scenes. Above all, I felt that the writers really loved the characters and I'm sure the actors responded to that. Much love flows from many scenes and the sight of Seo Ri's surrogate family taking shape is a sight to see and cherish.\nTISSUE WARNING ! chances are very good that you will cry; I cried a lot, since many of the events are sad yet some have a positive impact too. Anyway, fans of K Drama know full well that you have to go through Hell before you get to Heaven. And though the inevitable tsunami of revelations in the final third produces an ocean of tears, it's bearable because the main couple's, um, love boat is seaworthy ( anyone for an aquatic metaphor ? sorry ! ) & you know they can handle anything.\nNow, having built my Cathedral of Praise, I do have ( sigh ) a couple of very small complaints. The gorgeous ex model Jung Yoo Jin ( so under used in W & suits, please give her a show of her own ! ) does a good job here as CEO Kang, yet could've done SO much more. We see her dismounting from a big motor bike on one occasion ( such fertile ground for development ! ) so make her cute young assistant have a crush on her. Maybe he comically fantasises about rescuing her from a bunch of thugs or cooking her a lavish dinner ? Or, dressed in tight pants or shorts, she might get off that bike & toss her hair in sexy slo mo, then we see him removing his helmet in slo mo with just a little scooter next to him. Why not even have them discover a shared interest & start real dating ? Chan's big solo swim race also annoyed me slightly because I wanted him to put his cocky opponent DOWN ! And you don't really need words : just let him offer a little sly smile when he's taunted & follow it with a wink. But, I should mention the tech side as a balance, since the show is nicely shot and quite beautiful at times ( thanks DP ). So, my gripes are obviously minor flaws & I'm feeling a bit disloyal now !\nAlright, time for some more acclaim ! I'm so grateful to the cast & crew for creating this excellent show. A beautiful work of art can be admired for its construction and for the way it connects with our emotions. This one combines both. When you're down and thinking, what's the point ?, art like  But  can bring real pleasure and make a difference to someone's life.\nBack to the P word I used at the start ( & don't worry, I'm almost done ! ). I suppose I can't really award a  by traditional measures ( those little gripes, argh ! but I'll go with a . ), yet this is most definitely a towering achievement and I do urge you to watch it. True, I've made this review an epic but we excitable humans have to spread the word when we fall in love.

After a failed romance at work Dal ja counters with a paid boyfriend ( years younger than herself) to save face and finds herself drawn to him. She meets a rich man, separated from his wife, and is drawn to him too. Dal ja's Spring had fun while dealing with women over  (who are considered old), women dating younger men, women dating men with the right career path, women balancing work and family, jealous spouses, former loves becoming friends, etc. This show was enjoyable, touching, intelligent and understated. Dal ja's Spring wasn't overly dramatic and felt realistic. I was satisfied with where all the characters ended up at the end of the  episode series.What I liked about Dal ja's Spring: . Dal ja was played with pluck and good cheer by actress Chae Rim. Dal  ja's permed hair, her laugh, her toughness, her tenderness, her love for her friends and family, made her interesting and likable. I enjoyed the  episode evolution Dal ja made. . Tae bong the paid boyfriend was sensitive yet guarded and intriguing as portrayed by actor Lee Min ki. His story was an interesting onion that was peeled during the series. . Dal ja's co workers were fun and supportive, the kinds of folks you'd want to work with. Even the terror boss turns out to respect and admire Dal ja. . Dal ja's mother and grandmother loved her and wanted her happiness. To them that equaled marriage to a man with the right career which wasn't necessarily the option for Dal ja. .

KTV love story melodrama.  episodes. Early Spring .SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: This is the  Korean movie 'Love Me Not' remade into a TV drama with a different cast, wherein a young heiress discovers that everyone around her is trying to take advantage of her newfound wealth. She's at a disadvantage in her fending for herself though, because she happens to be blind, suicidal, and has a brain tumor!. Yep!!! This would be a little hard to swallow if this weren't Korean melodrama, but it is, so you're just going to have to roll with it!A con man with low morals and gambling debts quickly shows up to scheme the blind woman out of her money; he was (SPOILERS) friends with her actual long lost brother (who's now dead), so he assumes her brother's identity and gets to work trying to steal a fortune. The con man soon finds his new found sister is somewhat of a kindred spirit though, and he begins to pity her and quickly regrets what he's doing. Slowly but surely, he begins to truly want to care for her as the oppa she's always been missing, and then ultimately, he starts to fall in love with her.If you've been around the block with these shows, you know where all this is headed; Can con man become a decent guy? Can blind woman find her reason to keep on living, if she doesn't die outright anyway? Can these two help each other heal over time, and perhaps eventually be together and find love and live happily ever after? Blah, blah, blah!This particular series is primarily a simple slow burn romantic tragic melodrama when you get down to it. I typically don't like these shows very much because they're usually relentlessly bleak and somber, and they're often quite boring to boot as a result. To be fair, I personally prefer romantic K dramas that are more lighthearted & fun, or completely outrageous. This show plays it straight with its story for the most part, and although it tries to avoid being too tedious, it can be VERY slow moving at times (especially down the stretch).The reasons for the two leads to fall in love are a bit sketchy, and, their love sometimes lead to being borderline creepy in an incestuous way. I've seen this semi incest theme in a number of K dramas over the years, and it never fails to rub me the wrong way. There's always some out excuse reason so that it's not actually incest, but it frequently comes across as just being plain icky!Jo In Sung plays the con man. He's got a nice charisma to him, and, he does pretty decent work here in the role he's given. Song Hye Kyo plays the female lead. She's solid too (as usual), and she gets bonus points for having to portray a blind woman week after week. There's nothing wrong with either of their performances, but it's hard to really like either of their characters in the long run because of the nature of this show and the characters themselves. There's a few other primary supporting roles, the most prominent being the blind woman's caretaker stepmother, and the mob henchman who the con man has to pay back. There's also your two secondary young pretty characters (played by Kim Bum & Eun ji from APink ) who aren't really all that essential to the main plot in the scheme of things; they get the job done well enough in their subordinate parts, and they're arguably more likable than anybody else in this show by default.There are some problems that hold this show back from being just better than average IMO. It has some really bad pacing issues as it progresses, and, several of the story lines & relationships don't really make a whole lot of sense as the plot unfolds, such as (SUPER SPOILERS): A) Evil stepmother actually truly loves blind girl and will be sad if she ever has to leave her? Wait! What?; B) Con man's gangster friend must kill con man if he doesn't pay off his debt by an exact date?...why?...his death would clearly benefit no one because you can't collect debts from a dead guy; the only reason this story angle exists is to serve as a contrivance for the con man to have a made up reason to face his own mortality (i.e. so he can supposedly better identify with the dying blind tumor girl he's in love with); C) Can you operate on the blind tumor girl or not?...make up your mind will you!; D) The con man's gangster friend also has stomach cancer and he's dying too, but he sort of wants to reconcile with the con man (or maybe kill him) over something that happened to a girl they both loved when they were younger?...why?...is any of this back story nonsense really necessary?; and on and on it goes.This show is not overly terrible, and there are several things to like throughout, but I can't really recommend it as being anything more than just barely OK. It screamed to be only   episodes long (even though I realize that is unrealistic in this genre), and, it just hammers you with so much nonstop agony & misery that the central love story ultimately gets lost along the way. This mix of love, life, and loss should never be as difficult or complex (and depressing) as these shows tend to try to make you believe it is, and, the more these shows try to convince you otherwise, the worse things will inevitably get. There's a fine line between an epic sad love story saga versus an unenjoyable & overwrought emotional tale that's not all that coherent or cohesive. This is a perfect example of a show that is equal parts both!Summary: Skip this show and watch the movie 'Love Me Not' instead; you won't miss anything and you'll save yourself  hours.Bottom Line:  out of  stars.", "I love a melodrama that tells a story in the long mini series format. In this regard, I have discovered some gems in some recent South Korean TV mini series. The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back, and this may recur again. Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved. If personality dynamics are properly depicted in a valid manner, and if the production is skillful, powerful emotions can be evoked in the viewer. In this way we can live many lifetimes through movies, in our one lifetime   greatly enriching our experience.These South Korean productions (on Netflix streaming) are first class with excellent production and direction, some terrific casting and acting (particularly from some of the females who give some world class performances), brilliant musical accompaniment and staging. What makes these so good is the way they skillfully evoke deep emotion in the viewer. South Korean movie making is impressive.However, the following caveats must be considered. They are subtitled and some people hate this. The South Korean cultural norms, values and sanctions may sometimes seems silly or old fashioned to the USA viewer. The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation unity   sometimes reminiscence of old Capra films.Also, in order for the sometimes complicated sub plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing. This leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people which sometimes seems unlikely by USA cultural standards. The viewer may wonder at times why good but trusting people are so easily manipulated and deceived by bad and selfish people, but con artists do often succeed (just look at politicians for example). This poetic license of implausibility is needed to develop the story   just accept it even though unlikely at times. Taking these factors into account will help you become involved and emotionally engrossed. It was hard for me to quit watching at times so I binged watched.I would rank these as follows but tastes differ and your rankings might not agree:     (hard to say which is best)Shining InheritanceWhen a Man LovesThat Winter, The Wind BlowsSecret Garden. Five Fingers. The Scent of a Woman. The Great Queen Seondeok. A Hundred Years Inheritance. Lie To me. Roof Top Prince. Dr. Jin. The Great DoctorThat Winter.... is story of good and evil, a poignant story of love overcoming sociopathy (criminality and hate), nicely paced and developed, engrossing and involving thanks to great acting, music and production direction. However, the ending is flawed because of what is left out, requiring the viewer to fill in the blanks. To help you fill in the blanks without any spoiling, let me offer this: The stabbing death only seems to be, the void of the scene is that the person was saved and lived, but this fact was concealed to call off those wanting the death. Without this info the ending seems perhaps strange.Another reviewer unjustifiably denigrates this series.First, this reviewer states a dislike for love melodramas preferring comedy. Such a preference can cause a negative prejudice toward When Winter Comes...., and if you have this prejudice you can find fault with this one.Second, if you have extremely strong feelings against incest you will be disturbed with any mild hints of mild and false incest as in this series, but there is no incest at all in this series. Psychologically, most people have instincts against incest, but some people lack such negative incest instincts and there are cases of happy incestuous relations that cause no harm whatsoever. Most cases are harmful, where trauma was induced by one of the partners who forced coerced incest onto the other unwilling partner.Third, the negative reviewer questions how the evil nanny (erroneously described as the stepmother by the negative reviewer)does harm to the girl yet later loves her greatly. Here you have to understand the evil good character transition of the nanny who was initially hired to take care of the girl and sexually service the father. She was an outcast from her family and desperately needed the nanny job and thus degraded herself. She committed evil toward the girl in order to create a continuing need for employment as a nanny and be in a family. With time she comes to truly love the girl, and secure an important job in the company, and then becomes good rather than evil. Morality is a luxury   Dr. Arthur Wells. As this love and relationship developed over the years the nanny felt guilty but became devoted to the girl. We sometimes hurt the one we love, feel guilty, and become more loving as a result   it happens.Fourth, the negative reviewer wonders how the hired hit man threatens to kill the other man in order to collect a debt for the hit man's gangster boss (who ordered the other man killed out of the gangster's jealousy over his girlfriend who was in love with the man to be killed, using the framed debt as an excuse). What is the problem in this for the negative reviewer? What is also overlooked in this is that the hit man has extra incentive to kill the other man since that man is blamed by the hit man for the death of someone the hit man loved. Did the negative reviewer really watch the series?", "That Winter, the Wind Blows is the pinnacle of Jo Insung's career. He made an impressive comeback as Oh Soo the conman who falls in love with the blind heiress. Jo Insung had a  year absence, his previous work had been in the film A Frozen Flower where he was criticized for his bland acting; however he comes alive here with sensitivity and luminescence. It was as if the part was written for him. He makes it entirely his own and has great chemistry with the lead actress the lovely ethereal Song Hye Go. Jo Insung's crying scenes were particularly wonderful and genuine especially the scene where Oh Soo talks about his background. That Winter, the Wind Blows is about redemption and forgiveness.

Many observers were curious as to the secret to its success. Was it because of the gangsters? the actors?The main reason for this movie's phenomenal success was the fact that is was a very good movie about male friendship. In Korean culture, friendship between guys is a very strong relationship. Especially in the city in which the movie is set   Pusan   loyalty and sacrifice for friendship is seen as a very important part of honour.In this movie, friendship is tested to the limit from beginning to end, as the movie's two main leads (Yoo Oh Sung and Jang Dong Gun) grow from being teenage rebels to big time gangsters. The catch is, when they grow up, they become very different types of gangsters. One becomes a JOPOK   equivalent to the Korean Mafia, respected by the Korean people for sometimes punishing bad people. And the other becomes more of a thug gangster who kills and steals for fun.The direction is excellent, but the acting is the element which holds the film together as a whole. The two leads are two very different actors. The first, Yoo Oh Sung, plays the Mafia gangster and has a very tough as nails look and uses method acting skills.

Chingoo is a touching first person story about  boyhood friends and the way their lives unfold from carefree boyish cluelessness to the inevitable.There are flashy, chaotic,violent films like Pulp Fiction which become instant cult classics because they are not chaotic at all, but crafted immaculately. But the characters in Pulp Fiction are just that  unreal, comic book lowlives who inadvertently display a few human characteristics while going about their destructive, pulp fiction lives.Chingoo comes from the other direction, although it too is crafted superbly. No flash. Instead of the cool junkie Vincent portrayed by John Travolta, Joon suk ably evokes a glimpse of the personal hellworld of addiction...and later wryly comments that he found the will to clean up after he saw he was losing ground in the gangster corporate hierarchy. Very much the CEO material. Yes, he coulda been a corporate contendah\u0085.and  years earlier he would have been the Korean equivalent of a Samurai daimyo\u0085if only..These are real human characters growing up in a society that is rigidly disciplined, yet dynamic  and their paths take them literally on an escalator of fate to adulthood with just a whimsical struggle of will by Joon suk, the protagonist, the main toughguy. He evokes the late Lee Strasberg's famous line from The Godfather, These are the lives we've chosen, in the stolidity with which he accepts the horror of being a gangster. But he's a better man than the Godfather or the Pacino Godfather. He shows loyalty goes both ways.Thirty minutes after Pulp Fiction, you're hungry  in fact, there's no story to digest at all.

The local K TV cable channel recently ran The Queen of Office (sic), a Korean adaptation of the  Japanese drama Pride of the Temp in a late night time slot. It's a funny, enjoyable office comedy romance farce, but with a serious tale of the rise of a  tier workforce as a backdrop. Here is the title sequence narration:It's been  years since the Asian financial crisis. Korea now has  million contract workers. South Koreans' foremost dream is no longer national reunification. It is getting a permanent position. While everyone else yearns for a permanent position, there is someone who has consciously opted to be a contract worker. Ms. Kim is Korea's first ever contract worker by choice. Ms. Kim never works for free. She doesn't forge cumbersome interpersonal ties. After her three month contract period, she always leaves Korea. But no one knows how she's come to call herself Ms. Kim and chosen to be a serial contract worker.First, some comments about the more serious job market backdrop for the series. In this fictional play, Ms. Kim does the exact opposite of what at will employment for low pay and zero job security or prospects of advancement generally results in   she manages to amass the kinds of experience in each  month stint which normally requires decades of work at a job and the kind of dedication that results from employer employee reciprocity, the latter being a near extinct beast in the modern 'globalized' jobs landscape. But the series does a good job conveying the financial employment parlousness suffered by Ms. Kim's less exceptional fellow contract workers. The popular Naked Capitalism blog, whose motto is Fearless commentary on finance, economics, politics and power, refers to the ever increasing number of workers who have seen what were formerly steady jobs with decent benefits replaced by low paid, at will, benefit less contract positions as the precariat, in reference to the precariousness of their employment and, as a result, their lives in general. We can thank the global neoliberal economic project for this trend. Is it any wonder that the world is seeing   belatedly, to be sure   a large scale backlash against this elite greed driven system, in the form of things like Brexit and the rise of populist and anti globalization political figures such as Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in the U.S. and Marine Le Pen in France?But, back to the merits of the TV series   because of the strong element of farce in the series, viewers expecting any form of plausibility in the relationship between the two lead characters, Ms. Kim (Kim Hye Su) and the curly perm sporting chauvinist Jang Gyujik (Oh Ji Ho, who many fans of Korean drama will be familiar with by way of his more recent serious turn in the heartrending  family drama My Fair Lady, and whose character name here is a pun on the Korean phrase for permanent employee). Nevertheless the writers manage to balance the comedy with a slower developing long story arc about a deeper hidden connection shared by the two leads. There are also fine performances by the supporting cast, most notably in form of the characters Mr. Mu (Lee Hee Jun), Gyujik's extremely reserved longtime colleague and friend at Y Jang Food Company, and Jang Ju Ri (Jung Yu Mi), a young female contract worker from a second tier university hired around the same time as Ms. Kim, but whose situation more realistically depicts the lot of the temp worker. My personal favorite episode is the one in which Ms. Kim, Gyujik and Mr. Mu are dispatched to appear in a role playing exercise for the benefit of an audience of young schoolchildren at the nearby Soybean Paste Academy, wherein Mr. Rice Straw has an unfortunate run in with Ms. Lump of Raw Bean Paste, and hilarity ensues.

This series is handled with a certain delicacy; a restraint that doesn't prevent or hold back, but depicts the tender beauty of two people in love. I submit that a viewer may find it very difficult to pass judgment, for how does one justify judging love? Can love be judged?To the naive viewer, Sunjae Lee is a young man, barely , who thinks and feels with his hormones. This is a gross misinterpretation and understanding of who he is. Sunjae Lee is a simple young man who knows how to do things in only one way: with love and passion. A gifted pianist, Sunjae is able to captivate his audiences, whether they be a concert hall or a few listeners, not with just the beauty of his play, but with the heart and passion he puts into it. Several viewers are so captivated by his play, that he moves them to tears. It is a bit ironic that a young man of  already knows the secret to love and living simply.Oh Hyewon is a middle aged woman, approximately twenty years older than Sunjae. A renowned pianist when she was Sunjae's age, she has now found herself pulled into the world of wealth and power. She works for a Seohan Art Institute as an executive accountant. She loves the life that her money buys for her, and she has long forgotten the passion and her own love for music. She is married to a university professor, who also works for the institute. They share a house and a life that is more like those of roommates than of spouses. There is little tenderness or warmth in their relationship or in their house, which looks like a cold bastille atop the street. It is somewhat ironic that the only room in the house that has any warmth at all, is the music room.Sunjae's talent is soon discovered, and he's asked to come over to the professor's house to play. Hyewon is asked to listen, given her musical background. Immediately, she is taken back to a time when she used to share the same love and passion for music that Sunjae has. Hyewon can't help but be enamored by the young man, unable to realize that she has already captivated him.There is a certain degree of irony in their relationship, in which Hyewon attempts to teach Sunjae about her world; the world of power and treachery. It is a world that is completely foreign to Sunjae, and he already realizes that he wants no part of it. He is not interested in money or acquiring things. And yet, it is his simple and complete way of loving, that makes him Hyewon's teacher in that regard. The acting performances are all first rate, especially those of Ah in Yoo (Sunjae) and Hui ai Kim (Hyewon). The relationship between these two characters is handled deftly, like a piano piece...full of love, beauty, and grace. Viewers may find themselves longing for their own Sunjae...someone who can love so unequivocally and unconditionally as Sunjae can. His love is all the more profound in the little things that he does to ensure her comfort. One cannot mention this series without the incredible musical performances. Nearly every episode has a piano piece that seems to perfectly coincide with the feelings of Sunjae and Hyewon. Watching this series is like listening to a long concert, and by the end, you feel all the better for it!", "I loved this series on Netflix. The tension caused by the two leading actors is fantastic. The clothing worn by Hui Ae Kim and the luxurious surroundings are a sight to behold. it was lovely to see the politeness of Koreans which is similar to the Japanese in fashion. If you like classical music you should love this series as there is a good deal of it. I found Hui Ae Kim very exotic and sensual as she learns to deal with her feelings. Ah in Yoo is very good as the object of her fascination.", "I love this drama so much that I wrote my first review in IMDb. I found the show from Netflix. This is a story about how a young, poor, talented pianist (Lee Sun jae) fell in love with his teacher (Oh Hye won.) Oh Hye won was a married woman, who entered the marriage out of calculation to advance her social status. In fact, her life was full of calculation until Lee Sun jae entered her life. Lee Sun Jae, a young man who was madly in love with Oh Hye won, was not afraid of how their love was seen in other people's eyes. He just wanted Hye won to love him back with honesty. I was really impressed by the production quality of the show. Yoo Ah In (as Lee Sun jae)'s acting was stunning. He depicted a shy yet fearless young man precisely. His acting was a package: not only through his words and eyes, but also his eye brows, his mouth, and all his body languages. Kissing scenes are common in drama, but passion from him was the most contagious. I have also watched other older drama by Yoo Ah in. Secret Love Affair was the better one. Kim Hee ae (Oh Hye won) was an outstanding actress so the chemistry between the two was able to shine. When they were playing piano, you can feel the emotions between them. It is like music is where they could talk about their love loudly without any concerns of the world. The directing and music were so beautiful that I kept replaying the show after I have finished the show. I like how the show makes you wonder what is considered moral or not. Secret love affair is of course immoral in the eye of the society. But is a marriage based on interests really purer? However, I wasn't a big fan of the latter part of the story ,which was full of the obnoxious calculation and loud augments among those who were hungry for status and money. This part seemed to fall back to the typical format of Korean Drama....", "This is one of KDrama's best series with two fine actors in the leads. Yoo Ah In was actually several years older than the age of the character he plays, so his capturing of the gawkiness and hesitancy of the youth is particularly noteworthy, as is the character's gradual maturing and literally taking the lead in the relationship. We also must compliment the actors' memorizing the piano pieces. They and the professional OST are amazing. I could have done without the side plots as I just wanted the love story because it is so touching.", "I've watched over a hundred kdramas, and this is in my top . The story is about the relationship between a young piano prodigy and his mentor, and the piano playing is the best of any cinematic portrayal I know of. Their relationship is based on a shared love for music and his fascination with his very sophisticated mentor. She is in a loveless marriage, and gradually succumbs to his emotional directness and honesty. Those who are put off by the idea of a younger man older woman relationship won't like this series for that reason, but anyone open to an unusual relationship should love the combination of sophisticated realism, romance, and great music."], "Sentiment Score": 0.9950000000000001}, "20": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["This is a great show the over all concept us brilliant.

Be advised, this show has several different English titles; it's aka Mi Rae's Choice, The Future Choice, etc.This show is primarily a rom com drama with a fantasy element to it. These fantasy K drama shows never get old; but, ONLY if it's done right!...This show gets it right for the most part, and it's pretty good overall.SPOILERS AHEAD!Our story begins by introducing the main character (Mi Rae) as a struggling  something year old woman trying to find her way in the world; she's had zero luck in both her personal & professional affairs to date, and her directionless approach to life isn't helping matters any. Enter Mi Rae # ; this is the elder version of our younger Mi Rae. The elder Mi Rae has traveled back in time to stop her younger self from being an aimless loser who continually makes the wrong decisions (the results of which will ultimately be their mutual downfall).Other than the addition of the time travel premise, this show is basically a standard K drama tale involving the relationships between  girls and  guys. Yoon Eun Hye takes the lead as the younger Mi Rae; Eun Hye often plays this type of part, and she is very good in her role as usual. Veteran actress Choi Myung Gil nicely portrays the elder Mi Rae. Together, these two actresses strike a nice balance between older and younger versions of the same woman (although you will have to discount the fact that they look absolutely nothing like each other). Joining the two Mi Raes in their adventures to change the future are your  stereotypical love interest counterparts; they consist of the  hunky male leads, along with the gorgeous other girl. These  are quite good in their roles, and they're about what you'd expect from a show like this. Here's your summary of them:. TV anchorman (Lee Dong Gun): The primary male lead who the younger Mi Rae must not get involved with at all costs. He's a bit older and polished, and he quickly takes a liking to Mi Rae when she joins his broadcast team. He can be a little temperamental and stubborn at times, but is mostly appealing enough as a suitable love interest for our heroine.. Rich young business heir (Jung Yong Hwa): He's pretending to be an anonymous VJ at his family's broadcasting company while he learns the business from the ground up. He's a good looking charmer that's very reasonable despite some occasional immaturity. He represents the younger potential love interest available to Mi Rae, and, he falls for her right away too.. Reporter Girl aka the gorgeous other girl (Han Chae Ah). She just can't seem to find someone, anyone, to love her no matter how hard she tries. Suitable partners should be lining up around the block to catch this woman; alas, such is the life of being the gorgeous other girl in these K dramas. She's a bit of a sly fox when it comes to trying to land herself an appropriate guy of course, but she's far from being overly loathsome.This show gets off to a pretty decent start. The entire cast interacts really well with each other right from the get go, and no one is made out to be a true antagonist; nobody's perfect by any means, but they're all fairly amiable and well meaning for the most part. The story is fairly interesting and economically paced as well, and there's little to no time wasted on irrelevant & or pointless side plots. There's also loads of amusing extras deftly sprinkled in that provide some nice touches to the entire proceedings (from bleeped out cursing, to post production screen visuals & sound effects, to voice overs & first person camera angles, etc). Everything is kept light and tight from the beginning, and as a result, this show had all the makings of huge winner (ratings notwithstanding).Unfortunately (and, perhaps, inevitably), this show slowly begins to go in a different direction as it subtly changes its tone from mostly rom com to mainly drama. The transition is actually handled pretty well here, but the show does become a lot less charming as it progresses. It never gets terrible or overwrought with too much melodrama, but the nuances that made it incredibly appealing from the outset get stripped away one by one; gone are the comedic aspects, the catchy tunes to whistle along to, the general camaraderie and playfulness that permeated the early part of the show, and so forth. After a while, the elder Mi Rae becomes somewhat of a th wheel as the 'future implications' story line is deemed less important, and, the Reporter Girl is soon rendered irrelevant to the plot as well. Eventually, even the romantic appeal to the show disappears, and, all that's left is to watch the M & F leads slog through their regular routines for a while as the story winds down.All in all, I did rather like this show, and I will recommend it. However, I'm a little disappointed that it wasn't committed to staying its original course. I sat down and started watching a witty romantic comedy with a time travel sub plot, and ended up watching a rather mundane drama about the daily lives of everyday people. The odd thing is the drama part was pretty good; it's not over the top and much closer to reality than most K dramas, and I absolutely loved how the relationships & lives of everyone involved were ultimately resolved (in the life goes on sense). I really don't have any practical complaints to levy at this show, but, it did somewhat ruin all the fun I was having (and was further expecting) when I started watching it in the first place.Bottom Line: . out of  stars."], "Sentiment Score": 1.0}, "910": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1014": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1040": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1239": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["Physical violence between yoo hee and her housekeeper is unacceptable.\nShe should not punch him or kick him.\nPhysical violence between the doctor and yoohee is unacceptable. \nThe doctor should not punch her in the face.\nA strong woman does not tolerate any form of abuse and forgive so easily.\nFirst, he is not her husband, she did not commit adultery.\nSecond, he is not her father.\nThird, she is not his property."], "Sentiment Score": 0.51}, "537": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "329": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["Shopping King Louis is a surprisingly good drama.

Just that the teens did a very good job; especially Nam Ji hyun's depiction of the female lead. There were times when the story seemed to struggle with how to handle the two antagonists.

If it wasn't for Drama fever and Netflix,, nobody in the US would ever know. For fans of Martial arts movies and ninja stuff, there are few options that come anywhere close to being as good as this show. It's a TV show, not a movie but it kinda watches like one long movie of  episodes of  hour each. The format gives the title something that is missing in almost all Ninja Movies. Ninja films are often criticized for being a little too light on story lines in favor of packing them full of action. Warrior Baek Dong Su takes the time to develop the characters and a very intricate but fascinating plot. Part of it is loosely based on a historical figure of the same name. The rest is made up to make it, well, good. It is still packed with action from the first episode, all the way through to an amazing finally. At a high level,  boys grow up together. One becomes the best swordsman in Korea (which makes them the best in the universe according to Koreans). The other, is secretly part of an organization of assassins called the black Ninjas. He grows up to become the best assassin in Korea (also universe). They kinda fall out when Baek Dong Su finds out about his friends job. The assassin goes on to get involved in a plot to overthrow the king while the main guy (Baek Dong Su), leads the effort to stop them. There are tons of great characters. Only Koreans have names like God of Swordsmanship and address each other like that. If you like Ninjas, you will love this. The rest of you will probably dismiss this show as weird foreign nonsense which is a shame. If you can get past that part, you will probably enjoy it too.", "Warrior Baek Dong Soo is a historical Kdrama of  friends that take divergent paths. The storyline is presented in  layers, the adult storyline between rivals, Master Swordsman and Black Ninja Leader, and the young adult storyline between two childhood friends, Baek Dong Soo (becomes apprentice to the Master Swordsman) and Yeo Woon (becomes apprentice to the Black Ninja Leader). There is a heavy dose of political intrigue coveting the throne of the current king and eliminating the contenders for the throne. What I liked about Warrior Baek Dong Soo: a) Adult storyline lead actors nailed it and drew me in immediately. The quiet and gentle Master Swordsman Gwang Taek versus the hard drinking and hard hearted Black Ninja Leader Chun was compelling throughout the entire series. b) Young adult storyline lead actors grew and eventually hooked me too. As the characters transitioned from child to adult, the power of their storyline increased. The friendship between Baek Dong Soo and Yeo Woon was real and betrayal at the divergent paths they took combined with yearning to eventually be friends again was palpable. c) Top notch fight scenes. Not every fight scene was excellent, but there was beautifully staged and directed fight scenes in this series. Baek Dong Soo's single sword and Yeo Woon's double swords flew many times in this series. Master Swordsman Gwang Taek's finesse and Black Ninja Leader Chun's direct fighting were striking.What I did not like about Warrior Baek Dong Soo: a) Villains get away with murder (again and again) and had the upper hand the majority of the series. The balance of power should shift between the good and evil forces during the series, not stay squarely in the villain's domain. It makes our heroes weaker and less effective. b) Character reversals in the final episode. This series is  episodes and there was some continuity in character behavior until the final episode where  characters were written so their actions created an intolerable situation for one of our leads. This was difficult to swallow and reduced my opinion of the overall drama. They should have ended the series at episode  and I would have been satisfied not disappointed. c) The final episode epilogue was too long.

It was supposed to be  episodes, but the viewing public said otherwise and it was called off after  episodes. Obviously, a show that can't fulfill its  episode time slot due to poor ratings is not going to be receiving a glowing review from me!SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: A pretty mermaid has a crush on a handsome human. She hastily drinks a magic potion to become human for a while in order to be with him. Unfortunately, she didn't realize she now has only  days to find her true love before she downed this concoction, lest she disappear from this world forever.This is another K drama that was basically only airing on my TV for the viewing pleasure of my young nieces. It was rated for  years old, and that's basically the age range it caters to. It's not very well done though, due to its relentless predictability, lack of intelligence, and overall immaturity. Perhaps I'm just getting too old to even review a show such as this anymore, but with age comes wisdom, and I can easily recognize when a youthful show of this nature is basically just half assing their way through a lazily written story solely for the sake of watching pretty young people try to find themselves, love, the meaning to their existence, and blah, blah, blah. This show is awash with walking hairdos and abs trying to figure out how to be men, and doe eyed cuties trying to figure out how to become a woman. I have nothing against the main cast, and I actually rather like several of them from their present and previous works. The problem here is all of these performers are too old to be acting as if they're still relationship stunted middle school students (which is frequently how they are portrayed).The immaturity factor cannot be overstated here; the male lead (who's playing a college aged grad or thereabouts, despite the fact that he's roughly  years old in real life) cries at least once in  different episodes (Yes, I counted). I have long since become accustomed to men crying in these K dramas, but that is a % crying ratio per total episodes, and that is simply UNACCEPTABLE! There's also no shortage of scenes where he's generally just sulking or moping around as if he were a petulant child. The female lead mermaid is assigned to play an aegyo factory that fluctuates primarily between elation and despair throughout the production. As expected, this leads to her basically being either super cute, or super annoying, with little room in between. Both characters are likable enough during the few instances where they're acting like normal regular young adults but this (sadly) occurs far too infrequently. Much of the supporting cast suffers the same fate. i.e. there's lots of I'm so sad, now I'm so confused, now I'm so happy approach to storytelling here.This entire dichotomy of having the cast act like pre pubescent teens one minute, then hot young adults the next, just doesn't work very well. This show would have been much better served to either employ a younger cast or be more thoughtfully written to allow the actors & actresses they've hired to be more diverse and well rounded people, and a little more mature overall. Even the older actors & actresses on this show are often subjected to this immaturity, and it is painful to watch.The production values are good enough for a fantasy TV K drama, but the writing just sucks. As an example of this; the dude the mermaid has a crush on suffers from prosopagnosia (which is a disorder where you can't recognize other people's faces), except, sometimes he apparently doesn't suffer from it at all. It's a bizarre and obscure character trait to include to begin with, but worse is the fact that it serves no real purpose to the overall story, and it's occasionally brought up then dropped again several times throughout the show. The lead mermaid character seems more concerned with clubbing, making friends, goofing off, getting a job, and so forth, as opposed to concentrating on NOT DYING within the  day limit she's allotted! Toss in some bad 's American music and entertainment references, an early overuse of post edit screen captions, cast members breaking out selca shots and song & dance routines out of nowhere, pointless brief cameos from K Pop idols (as well as an industry wannabe who has no business being in front of the camera), and on and on it goes.This show is frequently disjointed. and yet it is incredibly predictable at the same time. There were many times where I questioned what the hell was going on, but there was never a doubt regarding who would ultimately be with whom, and what would basically occur to the entire cast of characters over the course of its run time.Summary: I try to be as objectionable and fair in regards to any review I write for these K dramas (regardless of the audience they're aimed at), and I have seen numerous youthfully oriented shows which I've rather enjoyed. But this ain't one of 'em. It has a few worthwhile moments here and there, but not nearly enough of them. As such, I can't recommend this show to anyone (regardless of how old you are)!P.S. My   yr old nieces (and their similarly aged girl friends) ultimately thought this show was just silly nonsense.

I'm giving this show two stars only because of the bad ending which wasn't satisfying to me. I understand what happened but i'm not happy with the ending at all! I don't expect to watch a second season as the only reason that kept me watching was the explanation which wasn't satisfying as i said, so i'm not excited to watch another season.", "This is a splendid drama. Strong story, tight execution, subtle acting and chemistry. Yes there's kind of virtual time travel, but the not so clear explanation (but the hint is very strong as to what's going on) is actually well done. Some may not like that though. The final message for sure takes center stage here instead of the plot.The captain and the female officer gave fantastic performances. The cases are interesting and essential to the main character finding his past and formulating his thoughts and choices for the future. And the cliffhanger really shines he main character fights to make sure the tough choice actually makes sense.The chemistry between the  male lead is good. The comedy aspect is not overdone. The strange gathering place where they drink and talk gives a weird vibe.My only gripe is the constant same camera trick of pulling zoom whenever the main character have a headache. That's just too distracting.Supposedly taken from the UK tv show, but this show carries it's own weight and transplant itself with old time radio Kpop, karaoke, chicken dinners, and male chauvinistic attitudes.

The small cases that took place and created the puzzle of the main story, the relationship between the members of the police team and the performances, were the highlights of the series. Especially the cases were really interesting and entertaining. The bromance and the dynamics of the team were so good that I'm wishing that there would be a second season, taking that epilogue in mind and the fact that they didn't really explained why he went back in time and how.

The story involves a lowly kitchen worker who wants to become a chef, the head chef as the romantic interest, and a ghost who wants to settle her grudge. There's also a murder mystery angle involved.SPOILERS AHEAD!Our story revolves around  young women; one is a lonely restaurant assistant who has a crush on her boss, but is too shy to act on it. She also happens to have the ability to see ghosts, which ain't helping her any in her personal or professional life. The other woman is a ghost who can't find her way to the afterlife because she's resentful that she died a virgin. She can't remember how she died and doesn't really care at first., she's just looking to inhabit any living woman she can in order to lose her virginity so she can finally leave this world. Ghost girl meets living girl and discovers that the chef she has a crush on is one of the few living men who can handle her supernatural sexual powers. Thus, ghost girl plans to quickly enter living girl's body to have sex with this chef in order to satisfy her desires before departing earth forever.What happens here is ghost girl periodically inhabits living girl in order to accomplish her main goal (i.e. getting laid). This creates all kinds of problems for the living girl, as she can't remember anything that occurs when the ghost girl takes over her body. Furthermore, these two women are polar opposites in terms of their personalities; living girl is timid and lethargic, and ghost girl is an aggressive loud mouth. Thus, everyone around living girl now thinks she's suffering from some multiple personality disorder as she switches back & forth from quiet & reserved to boisterous & outgoing (depending on whether her body is being occupied by the ghost girl or not).Unfortunately for ghost girl, this chef she's trying to seduce has old fashioned values and wants to take the slow approach to a relationship. She just wants to hop in the sack with the guy, but he won't acquiesce, and this frustrates her to no end. Left with few options, ghost girl and living girl team up in order to find a solution for each of their separate problems; ghost girl helps living girl blossom as an all around woman and win over the man she likes, and living girl allows ghost girl to continually try to accomplish her goal while also helping her out in other ways. It doesn't take long before these two girls become BFF's while also balancing out each other's personalities.Everything is going according to plan, but problems eventually arise. Ghost girl starts falling in love with the chef over time (which was not her intention), and living girl discovers that ghost girl's grudge may not be related to being a virgin at all. There's also an attractive career woman vying for the chef's affection that must be dealt with, and someone who might be inhabited by an evil spirit that eventually represents your main antagonist on several fronts. From there, it's just a matter of following along with the story to see how everything will play out.As usual, you need to give these K dramas some breathing room to see how they evolve before casting judgement. The first few episodes are a little rocky but the story does settle in quickly, and it's mostly entertaining for the bulk of its run time.There's a lot to like about this story and this show, and it's helped greatly by the performance of the two lead actresses. I'm quite familiar with Park Bo young (who portrays the living girl, and is the main star of the show), and she just kills it in a role that requires her to start out acting on opposite ends of the spectrum and slowly blending them into some middle ground over time. Kim Seul gi plays the ghost girl, and this isn't the first time I've seen her play a bit of a manic character in a supporting role, but she's quite good at it, and somebody needs to give her shot at as a lead actress asap. These two actresses drive this show from start to finish, and they interact so well that you'd think they've been working together for years.Jo Jung suk plays the chef and lead love interest. He's fairly likable and effective (especially when compared to the asshole head chef character portrayed in 'Pasta') and, of course, he's pretty easy on the eyes. The rest of the cast of characters not mentioned above consist of the ghost catcher lady with a soft spot for the ghost girl, an assortment of fit subordinate chef dudes ranging from reasonable to obnoxious and that get shirtless for no reason (other than to obviously appease the female viewers), along with a few others of import.This show utilizes several cooking related segments throughout, and a few ghostly special effects as needed, and while both of these of aspects are employed rather sparsely, they do serve their purpose. Production values are solid enough for this type of show, and it's competently written and directed as well (though you'll have to excuse the lack of rules of what a ghost can or can't do). There is a bit of lag during some of the middle episodes, but not so much that it doesn't comply with my number one rule for any K drama (i.e. Don't Be Boring!).Summary: Is it great?...Of course not!. But there are a number of things to like here. It does ultimately work quite well for what it is, it's also pretty well paced, and there's a nice mix of drama, humor, poignancy, suspense, love, etc. Personally, I thought it was very nicely done!Bottom Line:  out of  stars on the K Drama scale!...Solidly Recommended!", "I've seen many, many dramas; many good, some bad, others just forgettable. There are those I consider great, as in classics. Dramas I've seen twice or more, and will probably watch yet again in the future. Which is saying something because these things are often like watching + hour films. Secret Garden, My Girlfriend is a Gumiho, Lovely Kim Sam Soon, Hello Agashi, Cunning Single Lady, Healer, My Love From Another Star...well there are a bunch, and this is no exception.It's a bittersweet love story about moving on, letting go and overcoming obstacles. This drama nails the balance between humor, drama, thriller and the macabre. The acting, direction and writing are all top notch. The two actresses who star in the drama are stand outs   especially the main gal as she plays two completely different personalities flawlessly. If you are a fan of Korean dramas, or are new to the genre, this one is a fantastic watch. Highly recommend this one!!!", "Oh My Ghost! has a great premise of a young, shy, timid girl (Bong Sun) who can see and even communicate with ghosts. Petrified and harassed, she finds herself constantly tired due to lack of sleep and doing her best to avoid these pesky spirits! She even goes so far as to cover the walls of her tiny apartment in talismans and anything else that might keep the spirits away.Enter Soon Ae, a ghost who spends much of her time eluding the local shaman (Seobingo), who can not only see and interact with spirits, but she can catch them too!Bong Sun works at a restaurant under a nationally recognized chef who is constantly scolding her for her lack of attention, lack of energy, and most importantly, her lack of confidence. Constantly apologizing, she drives Chef Kang crazy, as well as her co workers. Once again, after being chased by Seobingo, Soon Ae takes possession of Bong Sun, and this is where the fun begins! Through the sudden habitation of Soon Ae, Bong Sun's personality is altered. She's confident, not shy at all, and even demonstrates innate cooking abilities, much to the shock and surprise of Chef Kang and his fellow cooks. Of course, the series is about how Bong Sun and Chef Kang will come together, as he's completely caught off guard by her sudden forwardness and flirtations. The series is a complete delight! I can't say enough about Bo Young Park's performance. She's able to switch personalities of Bong Su and being possessed by Soon Ae with all of the deftness of a master at her craft. The beauty of this is that Park is equally charming in both roles. She is so cute and adorable, that you love her in either part. Her charm is what drives the series. Of course, there is also a mystery to be solved regarding Soon Ae and how and why she died. Her story is just as interesting and intriguing as Bong Sun's. In fact, it can be noted that her story is touching as well as tragic. So much so, that you may find it hard to choke back a few tears. Seul Gi Kim does a magnificent job in this role. The series is a perfect balance and blend of drama, comedy, suspense, and romance. The four cooks who work under Kang are a perfect fit when a laugh is needed. They are hilarious and they work off each other so wonderfully. The entire cast is to be commended. There really isn't anything contrived at all in this series. The plot flows smoothly without anything feeling forced. I've seen too many plots where the writers and the director loses sight of the story and feels that they have to come up with something that is scarcely believable or plausible. Oh My Ghost! is a terrific series that you may have a hard time stopping after watching just one episode. You'll find yourself laughing a lot, shedding a few tears, and cheering in the end for Bong Sun and Soon Ae. Both of them realize that the key to Life is to Love. Because without it, Life is pretty dismal, whether you're alive or a ghost!", "This is one of the best korean drama i've ever watched! I really love Park Bo Young Characters! We can tell the difference when she plays the role of Na bong sun and the ghost. And for the Chef, he's so full of charisma! I'm starting to like him a lot < A lot of viewers are more liking the love between the ghost and chef. But i'm not. I really ship na bong sun and chef! Na bong sun really likes him a lot. She even made a scrap book about chef. And from my point of view, chef also likes her from the first time he saw her. At first, he acted like a bad guy because he thought that na bong sun shouldn't be a shy and always say 'sorry' to everything that she'd done. He didn't want her to be like him in the past who always got bullied by his school 'friends'. So he's hoping that she will do her best for herself. and this drama is really worth to watch. You won't be disappointed. OH MY GHOST, FIGHTING!", "I had never watched a Korean Drama before, I was scrolling on Netflix looking for something to watch for an hour to unwind and thought the premise sounded interesting. Then, I proceeded to watch as many episodes as possible until I fell unconscious. I did this for the next three days, everyday I got home from work. I was absolutely shattered but didn't care. Then, when I finished the series, I decided to go and watch my favourite parts over and over and over again. This is definitely in my top  favourite TV shows of all time. All the actors are amazing, Park Bo Young is absolutely terrific at acting as two different characters. The cinematography was done perfectly, I cannot describe to you the emotion and the humour that some of these shots added. The plot, the mystery, the suspense! And, of course, the romance! It was unpredictable, original and made me blush, laugh and cry. I've been in such a cheery mood since watching it. All the different characters and their storylines, this show had so many layers. I don't want to hype it up too much, but I do absolutely love it and would recommend it if you want something that can be both fun and emotional."], "Sentiment Score": 0.8626666666666666}, "138": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1324": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["The Time Between Dog and Wolf is the twilight hour when it becomes difficult to distinguish between good and evil, or friends from enemies.

Love.", "Our story begins telling the 'greatest love story' of Princess Pyeonggang and OnDal. We then cut to modern day, on a film set, creating a new take on the old love story. Soo Jung is starring as the princess, however when something is changed in the script and she doesn't know about it, she throws a huge tantrum. And so we are introduced to our main character; a stubborn and easily provoked actress, known as Korea's 'top star'. Due to certain events she drives off in her car and is magically transported back to the past into the time of the Princess and OnDal, and must figure out how to return to the present whilst trying to deal with love and war.The best thing about My Only Love Song was definitely the characters. Soo Jung, OnDal, Sam Yong, and Il Yong were all hilarious. A few of the characters I found annoying were the princess and the two guys who fawned over Il Yong but overall the characters were great. The flashbacks in the final episode really showed how much the characters had changed over the course of the series, especially Soo Jung, which was enjoyable to see. Soo Jung (Seung Yeon Kong) was the sassy main character, and although she's a terrible person, in the first few episodes at least, you just can't help but love her, especially when you start to peel away her tough exterior. Sam Yong is the small innocent character that just needs to be protected and he' so cute. OnDal seems cocky and sure of himself, but he's actually very lonely and needs support. Il Yong, the antagonist, is ridiculously in love with himself and a bit of a wimp but he's still twisted and sadistic.The plot I thought was fairly original, as I personally haven't seen any time travel K  Dramas myself. A few plot twists occurred throughout the series, although not all of them made sense and were not really explained. The best by far though was near the end when we discover the truth about the OnDal in the story and everything clicks into place! It also keeps you guessing which character will end up with who, and there is plenty of laughs and tears to be had along the way. The scene with the flowers and 'apologising in advance' is by far the cutest and will rip your heart out with feels. Because I'm a nerd and did some research about the original story about the princess and OnDal afterwards and I love that they kept so many details the same, for example, OnDal was known as 'the idiot' or 'the fool', so the show subtly referenced this by having Soo Jung call him 'dumb OnDai' lots, which I thought was cool.Other things: I was surprised by the special effects as they were very inconsistent. One minute they were really great and looked amazing and the next I was crying with laughter at how shockingly bad they were. The music was average, it didn't particularly stand out for me. I really like the whole design of both costumes and setting, I don't know how accurate they were but they were very aesthetically pleasing, especially the natural locations such as the huge river with the rocks.Overall, My Only Love Song is a fun and dramatic K Drama, the only real downside being a few plot inconsistencies. If you're a K Drama fan it's definitely worth watching but if you're new to K Drama then you might find it a bit weird and want something a little more normal to ease you in to the genre.", "\u2764Spoiler Alert\u2764Aaah...time travel, one of my favourite genres :) One of the best on screen chemistry I have seen, which makes the love story between On Dal and Su Jeong (aka Nannyeon) so immersing. I also love that the writer matched everyone together, I always felt that these kinds made the best dramas. I was afraid that the ending would disappoint, much like Rooftop Prince. Thankfully, the love story was given justice with an equally beautiful ending and did not disappoint.

Ah, and the actor didn't hold it even a bit while ...., how should I put it in good words, showing his love towards the actress. So it has pretty steamy kissing scene!", "A short drama to watch, that is both funny and romantic, but there isn't much in the plot. The performances were okay, and probably that was the reason why this one didn't flop, as the story was odd and kind of idiotic at some point. But, at least, the drama was entertaining, it had it's funny moments and the romance was okay, as the couple had chemistry. The ending, in addition, as a bit of a wrap up and it wasn't as much of a conclusion to the story and that left out many unanswered questions.

First mature Korean show I've seen. This isn't a love story, a life story is more appropriate. It's a very beautiful powerful representation of relations between people with awesome combination of lightness and seriousness; not only love but also friendship, siblings' love etc. Overall mood of drama is light; often it's L O L kind of funny without being idiotic and very heartwarming and sometimes it gives feeling of emptiness. I'm a guy and I'm not ashamed to admit that I shed many tears of happiness while watching Alone in Love. I felt like I was one of the members of their friend circle. I was attached emotionally with each character. I felt emotionally saturated after going through this lovely show! Eun ho (SYJ) and Dong jin's (KWS) views in narration on their life and love are inspiring and can be lessons for most people. Their views can be useful for any person any age, those who are in love, those who were in love and especially those who yet to be in love! Acting cast:Almost everyone was A+ in acting including guest roles! Gong Hyung Jin is brilliant and funny as an unconfident gynecologist and played an important role as best friend of main lead. Son Ye Jin: I don't need to talk about her. She's proved actress. She is flawless throughout whole show but her best performance was in the last two episodes. Lee Ha Na: I'm very very impressed by this actress! This was her first role in her career still she managed to perform it brilliantly. She was very natural, great expressions and dialogue delivery. Sometimes she was suppressed by the presence of Son Ye Jin but still she outclassed SYJ in many scenes! She definitely deserved her New Star award. Kam Woo Sung: Poor guy, every other actor in this drama got acknowledgment for their acting by getting either best actress; top excellence, New Star or supporting actor actress awards but this poor man missed it! I think his acting was best in the whole cast! Clever dialogue delivery! BEST! Music: Music was mesmerizing. I couldn't find OST album yet so I don't know specific track names to point out but I loved the music! Pros:  Very realistic  Romantic!  No angst and typical Asian show riddles  Excellent combination of all emotions  Perfect casting & acting!  Strong and likable characters  No idols  % nonsense  No annoying characters  Stable pace Cons: None, still I couldn't find anything negative except this was highly addictive. It felt like a  hour long movie! Who should watch this? As I said it's mature so it'll definitely suit mature audience but I think it's more advisable to recommend it to younger audience (I'm also in this group!) to give slight idea about love! So in short everyone! Highly recommended for everyone! If someone wants to watch a Korean show and wants to watch only one then I'd recommend Alone in Love. I'd easily sideline my previous joint # Salaryman and Evasive Inquiry Agency! Who should avoid this?  Those who want adrenaline rush in everything.  Those who want to live in fantasy.

What I like most about this drama at first glance is the casting, and the way all of the characters seem to be people who know who they are and don't try to be what they're not. Yoon yi puts on the stereotypical competent, loyal secretary mask while at work, but in her personal life she's messy, foul mouthed, and slightly annoying even to her friends. Chi won is, of course, her polar opposite: judgmental, overly cautious, rigid, and resistant to any social responsibilities. It's going to be entertaining to watch them clash, mostly because I think that Baek Jin hee and Daniel Choi are nailing their roles so far, fully committing themselves to their characters' wide extremes.\nYoon yi, who is a fun mix of organized and hot mess. I understand the need to be super organized in your work persona, leaving nothing left when it's time to go home. She seems like the kind of person who is good at her job because she's dedicated and driven, but she's also prone to bursts of inadvisable emotion, where she lets her feelings get the best of her and acts out in ways that could be harmful to herself and others. Kicking someone who's showing concern for you, even if you're in a terrible hurry, is pretty awful, and I don't blame Chi won for being disgusted when he witnesses her being insincere at the funeral, then turning around and demanding sincerity from him. Yoon yi may be a competent secretary, but she's driven by her instincts instead of what's right, which is something she's going to need to fix.\nChi won seems to have a very centered (if overly rigid) moral compass, making his lackadaisical attitude towards his job feel very out of character.\nThere's definitely some nepotism going on in this company, though I'm unsure yet exactly where everyone stands.

I've seen a lot these types of shows over the years and this one's not bad. I won't heap the undeserved praise (my opinion) on it that the other two reviewers did, and I feel its current IMDb rating of . stars is a bit on the high side. Nevertheless, it is good enough and solidly watchable.SPOILERS AHEAD!If you don't know what a Gumiho is, you clearly haven't watched much Korean cinema. This is at least the th different Korean movie or show I can think of (just off the top of my head) that involves one; there are probably dozens more of these stories though. A Gumiho is a mythical creature in Korean folklore; a nine tailed fox to be precise. The most similar mythical creature I can compare it to in western culture is a mermaid, and that's because they are both usually beautiful enticing creatures with or without supernatural powers that may or may not lead to your doom if you happen upon one.Gumiho stories and mermaid stories have been overused to say the least, but both legends provide a wide ranging spectrum to craft a story however you like. I've seen some really dark gumiho centric stories, that involve torturing men and eating their livers, bringing about the destruction of the human race, taking over the world, etc. This particular show sits on the other end of the spectrum, and it's basically just a fluffy romantic comedy.I don't really have any problems with this show, it's just that it's pretty forgettable; it breezes right in and breezes right away just as quickly. Shin Min a is your lead actress (the Gumiho). I've always had a thing for her, but that pretty much goes the same for any talented and pretty Korean actress. She's solid enough here. The lead actor is played by Lee Seung gi, who is a young solo singing artist that I don't recall seeing in any acting role before this. He doesn't yet have the star power of Min a, but he did just fine in his role as well. He plays a struggling young action actor who's trying to break into the big time. EDIT   : Seung gi is quite well known now compared to when I originally wrote this review years ago. The story (which I will try to recall from memory) begins with Min a trying to be married off in the Joseon era. Rumors are swirling that she might be a Gumiho though, so she has no takers; everyone fears it will bring doom and destruction upon their village, and as a man, I'd rather slowly destroy my liver the old fashioned way, instead of having it ripped out of my torso and watch it being eaten as I die a painful death. Heartbroken that nobody wants her, Min a realizes she has no place in society and is subsequently banished into a temple painting mural to be stored for all eternity (this is another common Korean legend concerning how immortal and inhuman creatures, beasts, etc...can be dispatched of). I can't remember if she does this voluntarily out of sheer despair, or is captured by a Gumiho hunter.Flash forward to . Min a is getting pretty tired of living in this painting for the last several hundred years, so she tricks our young male lead who happens upon the temple into uttering the right phrase or doing the right thing that will release her. He does so, and from there it's mostly a straightforward mythical rom com (kind of along the lines of the American movie: Splash). There are lots of cute moments that follow where he discovers who what she really is, and where she learns about the modern world and follows him around so she can eat more of her favorite dish (i.e. cow). Her  tails pop out uncontrollably whenever she gets overly excited, and she's helps him out of numerous jams using her super human abilities. At one point, she even saves his life using her special powers.The  leads quickly begin to fall in love, but all is not perfect; other characters find out about, or begin to suspect something is a little off with, Min a, as she and Seung gi try to keep her true identity secret. There's also a modern day Gumiho hunter (who apparently does not understand how shirt buttons work) that's hot on her trail. Eventually, Min a decides she wants to become human and live her life as a normal person with her true love. She's given a magical elixir by the Gumiho hunter that may just fulfill her wishes; it's not without risks though, as she or her new love or both may perish if she takes it. Down the hatch it goes though and let's see what happens.From there, it's a matter of what will happen to the two leads as they wait to see if they'll survive her transformation into becoming a human. And, of course, whether he, she, or both survive is dependent upon how strong their love is for one another.Bottom Line: I don't think this show belongs in the   star range the current IMDb reviews and ratings suggest (again, just my opinion). I've seen a lot of Korean melodramas over the years, so I feel I have a pretty good prospective on this genre. That being said (written), this show is quite enjoyable overall, and I have no problem recommending it. I also think it's a good recent starter show if you're not yet familiar with KTV dramas, as it's not as overly taxing as many other KTV melodramas can often be. It's a light and short comedic romance series that's pretty effective at what it's trying to accomplish, and what's not to like about that?I think  stars is just about right, so that's what I'm giving it!", "My Girlfriend is a Gumiho is a title I avoided for over a year after it arrived for European consumption. I had long ago become a big fan of the charming KDramas and JDramas from South Korea and Japan. Often inspired or even derived from anime and manga, these dramas, though generally formulaic, are wonderfully acted, charming, funny often, and hearken back to a time when movies and TV shows were great without gratuitous violence or demeaning language. But I avoided My Girlfriend is a Gumiho because the title seemed to promise a television experience about as thought provoking as Beach Blanket Bingo. Out of boredom I decided to try it out one night when I was looking for something to tide me over while waiting for a title to appear that would be more promising.Sounds rather stupid, doesn't it? That's what I thought until I actually watched it.I was so wrong. It only took one complete episode and I realized MGIAG was something special. The two leads, Lee Seung Gi as Cha Dae Woong, the brash but good hearted college guy whose dream is to be an action star, and Shin Min Ah as Gu Mi Ho, the Gumiho or Nine Tailed Fox a mystical creature who takes the form of a beautiful girl, are fantastic. These two wonderful actors inhabit these cute roles that start out as silly and adorable and slowly take on deeper meaning as the two of them begin to realize they have feelings for one another, and then tragic overtones as they realize that they most likely can never be.I swear I have never laughed so much as I did during the early episodes, nor have I cried so much as I did during the final three or four episodes as they acknowledge their love and grow into powerful souls devoted to protecting the other at all costs.

And it's a worth watching melodrama series. Initially my sassy girl crush Jun Ji Hyun turned down the role of heroine gumiho  that's great because it's destined to be Shin Min Ah's show I think. She was very cute, natural, and lovely as a gumiho, also a real fashionista  most of the times her simple dress up suited her perfectly. The chemistry between her and the talented hero Lee Sung  Gi ( as Cha Tae Woong) was adorable too bringing both emotional and funny scenes. Yes, many times the drama was so funny that I laughed a lot and felt that it's one of the best drama series I had watched so far. A lot of passers by and random characters focused by camera also added more natural flavor. The soundtracks specially the theme song were awesome and natural acting of other side characters  half human Dong Ju ( thumbs up for No Min Woo! ) , Woong's aunt and grandfather , director and villain like Hye In brought fun and suspense. So although in the ending episodes it became a bit clich\u00e9 and a little more story development and care for side characters would be much better, overall it's a lovely enjoyable drama. However, + years old gumiho obviously reminded me of + years old alien Do Min Joon (Kim Soo Hyun) from my previously watched outstanding series My Love from the Star. Gumiho heroine looked too naive where alien hero looked cool and wise but undoubtedly the both were so adorable at so many times.

First of all,i have to say that i loved Wonderful Days. A lot. The art is gorgeous, yes, i think this is the one point everyone can agree upon, hands down. Now, concerning the storyline itself....I think there should be some clarification, especially for all those poor ppl who must have watched this in English (either subtitled or dubbed). Those who did the translations deserves to get hanged. and i mean it. i own the special edition  disc original Korean DVDs and have also watched both the subtitled and dubbed versions. It actually feels like i'm watching  completely different versions of the story! The original korean version has a much more interesting (not the greatest, but definitely superior and full of nuances)script and explains the story quite well, unlike the English versions that either skip entire parts of dialogues (which are essential to understand the movie *_*) or change their meanings into something totally different and just plain wrong! And someone mentioned that some characters' names weren't mentioned in the movie till the very end. Well, i can tell you that the names (except that evil adjudant(?)) are mentioned quite early in the beginnings, but mysteriously, NOT in the English versions O_o ! I'm on the verge of thinking that it must be some sort of conspiracy to ruin this otherwise great movie... I suggest you watch the korean version....or get a korean friend to actually translate you the real lines, instead of getting confused at the horrible English sub dub. anyway. oh, and i honestly don't understand all those who say that the story wasn't original,good enough,etc etc. i mean, it might not be the most mind boggling thing on earth, but the twists are original enough to set it wiiiide apart from your average anime movies where all you have is  minutes of explosions, punches, boobies, and some supposedly dramatic ending (that ppl apparently find original). For those of you who still think the story isn't well explained in the movie...well, there's always the novelized version that came out in Korea (no English versions, sorry) that gives all the background story between the characters and all. Like what really happened in Shua & co.'s childhood, the characters' motives, blah blah...Boy, is this review getting longer and longer....A final word... considering the depressing situation in Korea (let's just say that animation comics are ignored by most and the market terribly limited) the creators and all those who worked on this film did an unbelievable job. I really hope things get better back there, cuz it's not the skills they lack, but public support and funding. oh, i guess i have to rate this thing.   for the story (  for the actual flow),   for the art,   for the efforts lol.", "Great great movie...tech wise. Ok, granted it's not the most elaborate or original of movie plots. It's the eternal story about love and jealousy, power and corruption, good and evil but it has got a Miyazaki twist to its story, or at least tries to emulate the master, rather unsuccessfully I might add. The animation is like nothing I have seen before though, and I HAVE seen Final Fantasy. Main problem: the characters are poorly developed, if not at all. And the story doesn't grab you by the collar and throw you in its world, so you're always aware of the animation, it being the masterpiece that it is... But again, it's a movie well worth seeing, some shots will even make your jaw drop and eyes bulge, that's how much the scenes are beautifully drawn and animated. The authenticity of the small things (rain dropping pattern, eyes watering) is what I personally marvelled at more than anything else. Oh, and an out of this world soundtrack to top it off, with some exquisite pieces that matched the moods perfectly. It was the only thing that really sucked me in a few times... All in all, it is a very promising start to all korean animations.", "This is definitely more than a pure animation. It's more like a movie, only an animated one. My emphasize here is on the word movie. Not because it has a brilliant colorful animation, that sometimes appears to be  dimensional, and sometimes  dimensional ( which is spectacular by itself). It has that. But I'm thinking of it as a movie because of high details. Actually, this is direction. When I watch animation, I don't really care who's the director of it. In fact, Until this one I forgot there is one in each animation like in every film. This movie is full of details that make it look much better than other animation. I'll mention some of them, that I found the most interesting.. Near the beginning of the movie, there is a scene with a tunnel exit covered by a waterfall, that flows not quite as one could expect of it. You get an explanation of the irrational flow a couple minutes after, but isn't it amazing they thought about it? . Flies around a lamp. When was the last time you saw flies around a lamp (in animation), just as part of the view, because they attracted to light and not to portray something ( like trash site, bad smell, dirt or other metaphoric things that flies represent). . While Jay was entering the rebel zone a guard watched him through the optics of a sniper rifle. They could show us only the guard, without the mentioned aspect. But no, this is what a direction is about!!! . Jay's fight with the army's commander. Just watch the details.I could possibly continue with some more examples,like shooting scenes from different angles and so, though those were the most vivid to me. Think about it. Think about they thought about it. In one word the animation was excellent. In some words it was a tasteful mixture, with live colorful characters and places. I don't really think they could do it better. Both the  dimensional animation and the  dimensional looked awesome. I really don't agree with those who say that the latter was dull and poorly done. As I said, I don't think it could be done better.Another aspect of this movie, that stroked me with it's uniqueness, at least from western animation, is the brutality and the naturalism. I don't know much animation (again western), where a gun was violently put against somebody's head, shooting it, and spilling the blood all around. I don't think this kind of violence is good or bad, but in a way it completes the movie. I just get the feeling that it's necessary. This also brings it closer to movies because there is some convention (unspoken) that animation is for younger audience.Well, the movie is not all good. Like every other movie, the plot is a crucial thing. Wonderful Day clearly lacks one. It tries to be scientifically ingenious in it's main idea which makes no sense if one thinks about it (you don't really have to think, its obvious enough). There is another thing that bothers. This movie involves a drama among three characters, which at the end gets exaggerated and too emotional ( emotional not for the viewer but for the characters themselves). There are a lot of animated and non animated movies with that kind of drama in them. Some of them pass this drama to the audience, while others try but fail. Wonderful Days belongs to the latter. It has a good revealing of the drama at the beginning and the middle of the movie, but in the end it disappoints.Wonderful Days' flaws are minor compared to its highlights. I would recommend it to anyone who likes animation and is not disturbed with excessive violence. My rating: . ", "This has become one of my absolute favourite films.I rented the German dubbed version, which is quite nicely done, apart from some sentences that seem to short for genuine German conversation (our phrases are usually % longer than, say, English phrases ... something seemed to be missing in the dub).The story is nice and a little mysterious, but it is very important to realize that the film tells quite a bit of it with images alone   no dialogue, no narration. Just these absolutely stunning images.I almost screamed in joy in the scene early in the flick where Shua and Jay sit, handcuffed together, him holding a gun to her face, in front of a beautiful Christian church glass artwork in this museum (time capsule room), and just the image tells the audience so much (and yet so delightfully little at the same time!), making this a scene without any dialogue was the best the film makers could have done.There is so much imagery. They really figured out how to blend excellent Gothic and oriental architecture with the industrial cyberpunk setting of the slums around the city Ecoban, and they made not only every second of it count, no, they give you gratuitous flights and motorcycle drives through the wonderful, desolate landscape that you sometimes wish would never end.All in all, a film with a definite   visuals, a   story, German dub quality  , a soundtrack that's easily a  , and subtle but decent sound effects,  .The best movie, in my opinion, that I have seen this year.", "Despite never hearing of the film prior to watching it, the opening sequence alone had me hooked. Great visual design, and vehicle animation complemented nicely by a soundtrack that has just the right mix of classical, neo rock, and new age allows this film to surpass similar Animated Computer Generated feature films. While the story isn't the most innovative amongst Science Fiction anime, it has its high points particularly in the beginning and conclusion. The director shifts perspectives from action scenes towards slower paced dramatic scenes before returning to the action for an excellent tempo. The use of flashback also helps to fill in the backgrounds of the characters. The use of methodically paced travel sequences coupled with superb music would really have to be experienced on the big screen preferably with Digital Light Processing(DLP) to fully appreciate its beauty.Fans of the Animatrix, Titan A.E., and Princess Mononoke would probably enjoy this, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to a broader audience because of its superb audio visual design, and landscape sequences. Worth Owning on Video for its high quality. Would be nice to see this given a professional transfer to DVD with known Actors much the way Armitage  and Princess Mononoke was given in Europe and North America."], "Sentiment Score": 0.718}, "1156": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "709": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "626": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "123": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["Come and hug me has you from the first few minutes of the very first episode.

Memories of Murder isn't a fast paced film, by any means, but this time the slow pace made this movie about an investigation of serial killings so much better than % of its American counterparts.Essentially, Memories of Murder is a drama first with thriller and comedy elements (yes, in the first hour or so the movie is actually quite funny). Kang ho Song and Sang kyung Kim are brilliant as the two cops who have drastically different views on how to solve a crime. The character development is fascinating and believable thanks to a great script.Highly recommended.", "This is probably the best crime thriller I've seen since Insomnia, and contains the most haunting climax of any serial killer flick since Seven. But like most films reaching for greatness, this is most admirable for its striking details.The filmmakers here craft a taut, careful, and delicately strung together motion picture that relishes in its amazing development of mood, place, and character.First, the mood: Haunting cinematography (rain falling on a small village at night, shadows darting across a thick field of grass, figures lurking in the woods, a masterfully choreographed hot pursuit scene on foot), a poignant music score (aided by the creepy use of a Korean pop song that accompanies each murder), and no nonsense direction (peppered with fabulous doses of comic relief  how Shakespearan!) keep the film more and more intriguing at each turn and fascinating to watch.Second, the place: South Korea, circa the late 's, and apparently under some sort of militia rule. This is inspired by the true story of Korea's first publicized (and still unsolved) serial killer case. This unique time and place serves as a wonderful respite from the typical American big city setting of so many other films of this ilk.Finally, the character development: The small details revealing the haunted souls of the detectives on the case is nothing short of brilliant. Witness the tiny executions of minutae: The cloth one rogue cop wraps around his boot so as not to leave scars when he kick boxes suspects into submission, the harried chief of police checking his own blood pressure while trying to keep his off the cuff detectives in line or fighting to keep headline starved reporters at bay, the young female officer desperately trying to showcase her abilities in crime solving between serving the chauvinistic detectives cups of fresh coffee, the outsider detective from Seoul's insistence that documents never lie (and the brutal irony at the climax that challenges his entire sense of being), and the main village detective's scathing speech on the difference between American FBI agents and Koren policemen. The beauty is in the details, and this film, like all the great ones, revels in their uncovering.One flaw is that some might find the film a bit long in the tooth, but this is not to be missed for fans of serial killer thrillers and police procedural movies. For the Korean filmmakers, and the amazing cast...this is their master stroke.", "I read a review about this movie and am aware what business it made in Korea, but nothing (I mean NOTHING) prepares me for this great work. With the exception of, perhaps, SEEN, serial killer movie has never been this good. The story (about real life killings of  women in Korea during the  ) is compelling enough, but the actors (Song Kang ho cuts you deep even when he's silent, and his big city partner offers emotional jolts at the end), the director (effectively plays some scenes in docu style approach), the cinematography (a shadow creeps out in the paddy field will give you, well, creeps. big one.), and the music (haunting) are welcome bonuses.One scene that impresses me most is the crime scene midnight chase between a suspect,  local detectives, and a big city detective (who doesn't know his local partners are there watching him). Humorously intense, or intensely humorous, whichever serves you well.The only regret is I saw this one on DVD, while I believe a movie this big (in many senses) deserves to be seen in theaters. Korean movies rarely touch Indonesian theaters.**** out of ****Try to listen the song SAD LETTER in this movie and tell me it's not haunting you. A magnum opus.", "Beginning in the fall of  and continuing for the next four years South Korea was haunted by the nation's first recorded serial killer. Preying upon women in a remote rural community the killer was both vicious and meticulous, strangling his victims with their own undergarments and leaving nothing of any use to the police investigating the crimes. The killer was never caught.I do not envy any director trying to make a true crime film, particularly not one so high profile and so recent that the crimes still live on in the public consciousness. Stray too far in one direction and you devolve into saccharine sentimentality, go the other direction and you risk crass exploitation. Director Bong Joon Ho avoided both of these traps by charting an altogether different route: he has made a film that is not about the killer or the crimes or the victims but one that is purely about the police officers charged with the case and the devastating emotional toll it took on their lives. In charting his unusual route Bong has created a bleak masterpiece, one that took home a stack of film awards in its native land but which has been largely neglected on these shores until now.The film begins with the first body discovered, a woman strangled with her own stockings, raped, tightly bound, and hidden in a drainage culvert. The detective in charge of the case is Park Du Man (Song Kang Ho) and it is immediately clear that he is out of his depth, that the entire local police force, in fact, are out of their depth. The crime scene is chaos, crowded by reporters and locals trampling over potentially vital evidence. Park himself is not what you'd call a systematic investigator, scoffing at the scientific approach and trusting in his supposedly unerring eye at picking out criminals just by looking at them. He relies on swagger and bravado and the brute force of his uneducated assisting officer Jo Yong Gu.Serving as a foil to Park and Jo is Seo Tae Yun (Kim Sang Kyung) a detective from Seoul who has volunteered to assist with the investigation. Seo is the polar opposite of Park   methodical and rational   and it takes mere moments for the two to clash, clashes that lead to the two of them overlooking some key pieces of evidence.As the film progresses and the body count continues to rise you can feel a sense of desperation slowly settle over the department. Under educated, under manned and woefully under equipped the local force is simply not up to the task. As the realisation that they will not find the evidence they so badly need begins to set in Park and Jo resort to planting evidence to bring in suspects Park picks out with his 'keen eye', suspects they then set out to extract coached confessions from. The process inevitably leads to public humiliation. Soon even Seo begins to lose his faith in reason and just as things bottom out they finally catch a break and settle on a prime suspect, one who truly appears likely to be their man. But can they make it stick? What sets Memories of Murder apart from the crowd are the rich performances from its leads and the sure hand of Bong Joon Ho. Bong knows exactly what he wants to do with this film and he steers the ship with a firm hand. He has a keen eye for imagery but he consistently avoids the cheap resolve, the quick hit, in favour of a slowly building mood and the film is all the stronger because of it. Song and Kim are both stellar in their roles, giving their characters much needed depth. You can feel their frustration and helplessness continually growing and when the final crushing blow is delivered you can feel their utter despair at being abandoned by a system that they have given their lives to. Bong isn't just asking how this could happen, how someone could be as evil as this killer, but how could a government allow this to happen? How could the police not be given the tools and manpower they so obviously needed to protect the people? The DVD release has been given the standard Palm treatment. The transfer is strong and presented in anamorphic widescreen. The film is presented with both the original Korean language track in . stereo and an English dub in both . and .. The English subtitles are solid, clearly translated and easy to read. The disc also includes a reel of cast and crew interviews discussing their characters and the creation of the film as well as an extensive reel of deleted scenes.Memories of Murder is a minor masterpiece, a film that moved Bong immediately onto Korea's A list of directing talent. It is richly detailed, beautifully performed and disturbing in precisely the way that people need to be disturbed in from time to time.

This really taps into the difficulties of dating someone whose appearance changes completely on a daily basis. There's some very good, everyday humor as well \u2013 which makes this film more pleasant than one might think.

I was wondering how they were going to go about this premised. Well it turned out to be a a romance movie about a guy that changes physically every time he sleeps. And I will say, besides the guy changing physically every time he sleeps, this is a very very very generic romance movie. The lead actress in this is Han Hyo joo who I wasn't really a fan of. Let's just say even after watching this, she still didn't stand out to me. I think she should stick to being in old historical films and movies. This movie started off pretty promising, but the most drawn out and least interesting part started when the lead character hooks up with the girl. There was thousand of different possibilities this movie could have gone, but it chose to most boring and generic route possible. There was no emotional impact, even during scenes where they tried to bring it out from the audience. I just simply didn't care.

Or if you wake up as an old woman, do you have the physical problems? You get the idea. An endless list of interesting and potentially funny or touching scenes, almost none of them examined in this film. Instead, regardless of how he looks, Woo Jin wakes up as the same basic person.

It's another fantasy time travel romantic drama that deals with reincarnation and circular themes that are common to many Asian productions.SPOILERS AHEAD!Your story begins with a prince in Joseon era (Korea; approximately  years or so ago) who dotes on his wife, but he also clearly has some interest in her sister. The sister was actually the one who was supposed to be the princess, but she got scarred in an accident before the engagement and was thus no longer deemed suitable to be the future queen. All is going along well enough, until the princess is found dead one night, drowned in a lake under suspicious circumstances. The prince sets off to investigate what happened and rounds up  people to help him (a legendary fighter, a brilliant scholar, and a cross dresser who hears all rumors and secrets in town). While investigating the mystery, the  of them are somehow transported to modern day Korea (via some magical once in a life time lunar eclipse or something).While this is happening, there's a nd story taking place in modern day Korea. Two stepsisters are brought together when a widowed divorced man & women meet. The older stepsister doesn't like this arrangement a whole lot, and she makes an impulsive decision to abandon her younger stepsister one day. The younger sister is orphaned then eventually adopted and relocated to America where she grows up not knowing remembering her parents or what happened to her. Once grown, the adopted sister sets off to find her real parents and learn more about her history. So, she travels back to Korea where she and her stepsister are reunited. Now, your gimmick here is that the  lead actresses play the roles of each sets of sisters in both the past and the present, and one of the sisters wronged the other during their youth in each time period. The prince from the past also plays another character who is the missing son of a wealthy family in the present; this makes for great karmic drama & intrigue that only adds to the overall entertainment value of this show. Korean melodramas have been pushing these dual role character timeline plots quite a bit lately, to a pretty fair degree of success, and it's easy to see why; this breaks up the status quo monotony, allows for actors to perform diversely, gives the writers and directors a chance to be creative, etc. I can easily foresee the day (probably very soon) when these productions will further expand upon this format by incorporating  roles stories at once.As the story unfolds, our  men from the past are transported to the roof top of the adopted sister's tiny apartment in modern day Korea. These men were the cream of the crop at their specific skill set in the past, but are totally incompetent when faced with modern day tasks; they can't even figure out how to feed themselves, much less understand how a toilet, elevator, TV, etc works. Our young heroine (the adopted sister) takes them in like a litter of lost puppies and puts them to work while she teaches them about the modern world they now inhabit. The prince is not used to living as a pauper though, or communicating with an independent woman in a modern society, so there's some friction between the two main characters to begin with. Soon enough though, the time travelers start to adapt to their new life, the prince becomes more involved with the  sisters in the present, and well, it doesn't take a genius to figure out where all this is headed. This show has what you're looking for if you're a fan of this genre, and, as a bonus, it's mostly accessible to those who aren't 'fans'. You've got your dual back & forth love stories between and among the  protagonists, your manipulative male and female antagonists, plenty of fist clinching hand wringing, family business power struggles, growth and eventual acceptance between family members, etc.The never ending Korean well, from which talented gorgeous women & hunky dudes seem to spring from, is still overflowing. The more put together or sexy characters are the meaner people, and the cuter ones are the nicer people, as usual. The main mean dude is ridiculously good looking, and, it's a shame the mean female lead didn't get to play the nice sister as her brilliant smile just lights up a room. It's almost impossible to not draw comparisons between this show and Queen In Hyun's Man; both shows aired very close in time to each other, and each feature noble men from Joseon era who travel forward in time to modern day Korea. Intrigue, hijinks, drama, & romance ensue; you know the deal by now if you've seen a few KTV melodramas. Rooftop has more of a typical K drama aesthetic to it in both production values and storytelling than does Queen, and it is by far the more soap opera ish of the two, whereas Queen takes a more stylized and slicker approach that's more similar to a well polished movie. Queen is also much better written than Rooftop IMO. That's no knock on Rooftop though, as this show is pretty entertaining. It is often sillier and more comedic in tone than Queen, and it almost runs off the rails a few times and does get a little too over the top and repetitive as it progresses, but that's the way it goes. Which one is better?...that probably depends on what you're looking for, or typically like. I personally prefer Queen, and I do feel it is by far the better of the two overall (for my tastes), but you likely can't go wrong with Rooftop either, and I liked it well enough.Final Score:  out of  stars. I can't justify giving it any higher rating than that. It's fairly enjoyable overall.", "I tend to enjoy a good time travel movie and as a Netflix subscriber, I get recommendations based on other things I have watched. Rooftop Prince was a Netflix recommendation. The idea of a Korean TV show with subtitles didn't seem like something I would care much about, but it wouldn't hurt to watch the first episode and see. That is what I did and I got hooked immediately.Some of the things I found so refreshing about this show is # it is clean. No offensive joking or language. # it is hilarious at times and thrilling at other times. It has everything a good drama should have  greed, murder, mystery, romance, wealth and yet much of the time, it was very sweet. Throwing in some reincarnation and time travel just ices the cake for me. I love it. The two main characters (romantic) have a tremendous chemistry together. I would love to see them both again.I binge watched all  episodes and I may watch them all again. At times the dialog went by too fast with the subtitles, I couldn't read it, but most of the time I was able to understand what was going on.Each episode leaves you with a cliffhanger. Everything is concluded satisfactorily at last episode. Each episode is about an hour and  minutes long. I don't really get that odd amount of time. Here a TV show is fitted into an hour with commercials, generally so it might be  minutes without commercials. I wonder how they fit their TV shows in Korea for watching?I gave it  stars because it was so enjoyable and addictive. I am going through withdrawal now that I am done watching it. In my opinion, there is nothing this entertaining on American TV lately.", "The plot is creative, with a constant shift from modern to ancient to modern.

The last one is about a female president having to deal with her trouble making husband, who isn't such a bad guy. The only plot that stood out to me the one with Jang Dong gun playing the main role as president, I personally think they should have made just one president played by Jang Dong gun to play the main role throughout the whole film.

Picture this as a movie plot line  PRESIDENT WINS LOTTERY, SCHEMES TO COLLECT WINNINGS WITHOUT GIVING HIS IDENTITY AWAY  sounds like it could either be hilarious or completely stupid right? Its exactly why i liked it so much.There's a hilarious sequence where he actually goes to claim his winnings dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and a tiny fake mustache (which of course begins to peal from his face from the second he gets to the claims window) He then proceeds to get into an argument with a much younger guy in back of him who's getting mad that pops is holding up the line (which of course causes the Pres to ask Do You Know Who I Am? How Dare You Talk To Me Like That!) That one sequence alone is so inspired, so completely silly, so absolutely ridiculous  I swear I laughed for like  whole minutes after it was over  it was almost too silly. (i LOVED it!!!) Eventually of course it turns into a moralist tale about how you should do the right thing when you encounter that much luck and money and blah  it was still pretty funny though.The other  story lines aren't as silly  although they are pretty engaging and sunny optimistic as well. The nd plot line involves a president who while worried about preventing nuclear war between Japan and North Korea manages to re connect with his great lost love  his former next door neighbor who is now a hard bitten news woman  AND gets propositioned by this guy who simply wants to ask him if he'll donate his kidney to his dying father. Why does this stranger ask the president of all people to donate his kidney? Cause He's The President  And The President Should Help His Countrymen. (that's sound some reasoning  the ending of this segment has a pretty good punchline tho.) The rd plot line is that Korea's first female president gets voted into office (defeating the nd Pres  i guess he wasn't so popular with his countrymen after all.) and her husband who's a guy who likes to get his drink on with his buddies causes embarrassment and ultimately asks for a divorce cause he can't stand being followed around everywhere by the secret service agents while he just wants to hang around and get drunk with his friends. (There's a good scene here where he and his friends drunkenly go to the gates of the Korean president house where they taunt the secret service agents   one of his friends is constantly referred to as Optimus Prime  and when Optimus Prime starts to drunkenly pee on one of the agents  the agent claims that they are under attack from Optimus Prime!) The film then becomes about whether its OK for a leader to also act as a spurned lover and beg her husband to come back because she actually loves him.That former question  Can A Leader Act Silly And Goofy And Still Be Taken Seriously As A Leader seems to be the main theme of the film   What Undermimes A Leader With His People? And its a good premise for a film  certainly one that hasn't been done a thousand times already  especially in this age where every gaffe and every misquote and every misdeed is recorded instantly and endlessly commented on by everyone in the universe within a matter of hours (if not minutes) The film however as sweet and as playful as it is   the synopsis for it in the festival i saw it as part of listed it as Capraesque (but Tatiesque would be a more apt description.)it may be too slight to really go for the gusto in answering these questions. Personally i think the movie should've gone even more into surrealism or absurdest situations as the attempts to ground the movie in seriousness with the whole north Korean Japanese business only serves to undermine the film's message that a good leader can't (or shouldn't) be undermined by silliness. The film is quite entertaining however   even if it is ultimately more corny and more sweet then it is gut bouncingly funny even if that president having the winning lottery ticket scenario of the first plotting is just awesomely silly and sweetly goofy in just the right combo that i hated to see it replaced by a different plot line!"], "Sentiment Score": 0.99}, "812": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "772": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "993": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": ["Fugitive Plan B is a Korean TV series that just plain sucks.SPOILERS AHEAD!I don't know why I bothered with this show as I could tell it was going to suck soon after I began watching it, but I finished all of it out somehow!...Please don't watch it...you will regret it if you do. I will now commence with my review of this series, and will consider my worldwide community service done for a little while. Story; Private Investigator is hired by a young heiress to find out who killed her family. While investigating, they discover her family left behind some hidden gold that an evil organization is trying to find. Meanwhile, there's a cop who's chasing the PI as the PI is apparently also a wanted criminal. There's a bunch of side characters and sub plots tossed in along the way, and everybody involved eventually tries to find the gold while trying to either capture someone, kill someone, or turn someone into the authorities. It can mostly be considered as an Action Drama.The main problem with this show is that it is both ill conceived and poorly written. It's basically: plot point, fight scene, plot point, chase scene, plot point, repeat ad nauseam. While this may sound like it might be exciting, it most decidedly is not; in fact, it's downright boring. The majority of the fight and chase scenes don't carry any suspense as no one ever seems to get hurt, and if someone gets caught, they just escape in the very next scene anyway. It appears they only had part time makeup artists on set as well, as half the time everybody escapes from a big fight without a single blemish, but are bleeding profusely from the next big fight at other times.There are also many attempts at comedy throughout that fall flat unless you're a  year old. Contrary to what the writers may think, it's not hilarious to see Rain get his ass stuck in some lady's face during car chase scene # . There's also a side character who's another PI in Thailand or the Philippines or somewhere; his name is James Bong (Jeeesh)...he's supposed to be the comic relief I guess, but he's not funny at all, and is one of the most annoying characters you'll ever see on TV, that is until you get a load of his idiotic sidekick.The actors all seem out of place too, and seem mostly disinterested as the show drags on. Who can blame them really? Rain is your lead actor here as the PI; he gives a gallant effort to play along with all the stupidity, but he mostly comes across as a silly goof ball. Daniel Henney is one of the other  male leads. The dialogue he's given to work with is downright painful to listen to, and it's not helped by the fact that he still can't speak Korean. It appears he tries to learn the script in Korean but there apparently wasn't enough time, so he speaks the first few sentences of some conversations in Korean, then he speaks the rest in English. I'm not kidding, that's how ridiculous this show is! The lead actress walks around with an expression on her face that suggests she's wondering how her career sank to this level. I kinda felt bad for the actresses and actors involved, and you can almost tell, at about the midpoint of the show, that they're just clock watching hoping this giant turd they're stuck in will get flushed away soon. The writing and direction teams, however, should all be given a swift kick in the nuts.I think the show had visions of being a lighthearted version of Iris or thereabouts. It's more similar to a lighthearted version of A Man Called God. That show was awful too, but at least it was outrageously awful. Both shows even include an evil dude in a wheelchair who doesn't need a wheelchair. I can only imagine what a veteran actor must be thinking when he reads the script and learns he's no longer crippled:\nVeteran Actor: Ummm, excuse me Mr. Director, I've been in a wheelchair this whole time, and now you want me to get up and just start walking around?\nMr. Director: Yeah, it'll be great. People will love it.\nVeteran Actor: You're an Idiot!This show is just a mess. There's very little (if anything) worthwhile here. There's only one character I even remotely liked and that's the cute girl cop who has a crush on her squad leader. Of course, (SPOILERS) they killed her character off in a ham fisted effort to inject some mandatory melodrama into the story.And, to add insult to injury to every male watching the show (or female if you swing that way), these geniuses decide to (SPOILERS) kill off just about every pretty lady on the show: the cute detective, the hot assistant to Henney's character, the pretty Japanese professor (oh wait, she's not killed, she's just in hiding for a while until she shows back up in what else but a wheelchair. Maybe they only had one wheelchair on set, and that's why the evil dude had to get up out of it, so the professor could sit down), and most egregiously, the PI office assistant with the amazing rack. They don't even bother to kill her, she just completely disappears from the show after a couple episodes without any explanation, and nobody seems to notice or care. I know if I were the PI, I'd be wanting to know where my cleavage bearing assistant is. Look, if they wanted me to watch this pile of garbage, the least they could've done was show me some titties, unfortunately, they couldn't even get that right!

There is not much logic here, true, and reasons for anything are, at the very best, faintly perceptible. But is not really the point.

He steps into the character with ease, playing a rouge, funny, silly and sometimes surprisingly serious PI, in the very best tradition of the original Lupin III manga series. Lee Na young (Ruler of Your Own World) managed to make her character believable and, trust me, it was not an easy task   see the part about reasons above... :) The supportive crew is really good   Henney being sort of perfect for his character (a dubious honor, but true), and Lee Jung jin and Yoon Jin seo complementing each other perfectly. Special prize should go to Seong Dong il, playing Namkamura Hwang, he is The Nakamura. ;) Martial arts choreography is impressive, although a little bit too smooth for my taste. Korean directors seem to prefer a dance like quality in the fighting scenes and it shows   as usual. Yet I cannot honestly say it is some kind of a setback, just part of K drama experience. ;) I got to really appreciate Lee Na young performance in fighting scenes. She is not an action heroin and it's well worth seeing the special episode () just to see how much work did she put to make it look like it does. Good camera work, in some scenes bordering on excellent, music fits the rhythm of action   sometimes vice versa. Seriously, what more could you want? And yes, to be honest, I would say a solid  out of , but the fact is, I just feel some guys tend to give bad score simply because they don't like K action drama.

The characters change throughout the series, and you grow to like them, then dislike them, then like them again. And that, I think, is the best part about this series and it makes it unique.

AND IT IS A HAPPY ENDING IF YOU'LL SEE THE COMPLETE ENDING. I don't know why did everyone said the ending was bad? I cried the whole episode literally! But I was totally satisfied. It was to realistic. As much as it was about Yu Jong and Seol's love, it was about the growth of their characters. Not just their but Baek In Ha and Baek In Ho too. The story was more realistic than anything that I have ever seen. Honestly, I was all tears the moment I realized he was going to leave her for her own sake but somewhere I understood him probably because I identify my nature with Seol way too much. Just like her, I had hope it will work out and he will come back. Till the very last moment I somehow managed to tell myself that it was fine even if they don't meet because they have grown up and has learnt so much and somehow I managed to put up a smile because of Bak In Ha but I truly broke down into tears the moment I heard Seol a in the end. It felt like I got my boyfriend back. I don't why people think the ending isn't good and that it isn't solid enough because if you'll look at it in a different light, the second male lead had a strong character because his story is equally important and thus, the story isn't just a love story or a love triangle, it was about the growth of people who contained their anger, who contained their feelings and who felt alone and never told anyone. The story wasn't about LOVE CONQUERS ALL it was about ACCEPT YOUR TRUE SELF.I was so happy when Seol hugged Yoo Jong after that Sang Chul incident at the company when the guy had tears in his eyes that was so real. I kind of really think that this someone's real story because you can't nail such emotions so well. Like the way Yoo Jong behaved when Seol first bought gift for him, He was so surprised and touched that he couldn't understand how to react and was so taken aback in his own feelings and then when he hugged her it was just so pure.

If you want a genuine portrayal of a love affair from its beginning to its end, then watch this.", "This isn't a film about plot, so I'll concentrate on describing the main characters. Sang Woo is a single sound engineer living with his family. Eun su is a radio show host who lives about  hours away, by herself in a small, somewhat messy apartment. They meet to record the sound of wind in a bamboo forest for her radio show, and a relationship develops between them. The film observes them over the course of the changing seasons in Korea, starting in the Spring both in terms of the calendar and their relationship.The pace is deliberate, and the characters don't really change much, but the film is beautiful and, not surprisingly, lovely to listen to, and it's definitely worth seeing. I think that the male lead (Ji tae Yu) is particularly good in his role. My understanding is that the film won the top prize at Korea's equivalent to the Academy Awards.I saw this at the San Francisco International Film Festival on   , where an earlier showing was the U.S. premiere. The director was present to answer questions, through an interpreter, and one of his responses indicated that viewers who are more experienced in love tend to identify with the female lead, while those less experienced see themselves in the male character.", "Although Alfred Lord Tennyson said, Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all, anyone who has endured the breakup of an intense relationship would not necessarily agree. Certainly not Lee Sang woo, the young sound engineer from Seoul, Korea in Hur Jin ho's exquisite second feature One Fine Spring Day (literally Spring day goes). In the film of quiet power, two young people meet, fall in love, then gradually pull back and withdraw, but the film is not about their circumstances, but about the impermanence of life and how we must learn to ride the roller coaster. Like Hur's  film Christmas in August, it is a realistic and intimate work, filled with a touching lyricism that never succumbs to manipulative devices.Working to record sounds of nature for a radio station, Sang woo and radio disc jockey Han Eun su meet at a bus station in a most unusual way. Unable to wake her from a bench in the waiting room, he calls her on his cell phone even though she is sitting right next to him. As they work together, their relationship develops slowly. She has recently been divorced and he lives at home with his father, aunt, and grandmother. The joy of discovering a new relationship is conveyed against a background of nature \u0096 its mountains, forests, and streams and, as we listen to the two recording the sound of the wind against the bamboo and the wheat fields, we are struck by the mood of serenity created by the cinematography of Kim Hyeong gyu and the original music of Jo Sung woo, based on the French ballad, Plaisir D'amour.Impermanence is a constant theme in the film and the seasons represent various stages in the character's relationship. To underscore the fleeting nature of love, Sang woo's grandmother denies that her deceased husband was ever unfaithful to her and, barely in touch with reality, goes to the train station everyday to wait for him. Though Eun su lives in the provinces, she and Sang woo begin to meet each other after work and spend some nights together. On the surface, they are an attractive couple   warm, sensitive, and very cute together. But Hur drops hints that each, in their own way is eager to pull away from what looks like it might become a lasting relationship. Though the reason for their growing coolness toward each other is not specifically defined, she may be reacting to the fallout from her last marriage or may be put off by his tendency to cling. In his first real relationship, he may be having thoughts that it is too soon to close off other possibilities in life.Neither, however, communicates their fears and, like a flower that is not being nurtured, their relationship is allowed to wither. As she withdraws, he pursues her even more, giving her the upper hand and placing her in a controlling position and Sang woo is run by his expectations and disappointment, drinking and hiding out when things start to turn sour. In One Fine Spring Day, we learn that, as in the Buddhist tradition, life has the characteristics of instantaneity, impermanence, and decay and that the three realms are deceptive and illusory in nature. We share Sang woo's discovery of the joy of love and also its confusion and pain. Literally, not too much happens in the film, and, on paper it sounds ordinary, but, like the poetry of Walt Whitman, if we look beneath the surface we can easily see the divine in the commonplace.", "This is another very quiet film by Hur about the relationship between two people.  Like Christmas in August the direction is such that excessive dialogue is unnecessary.  We know what the two people involved are thinking at all times through their eyes, the way the look (or don't look) at each other.It's a story that anyone who has had any experience in love will immediately recognize and get that I have been there feeling.  The film doesn't sympathize with one person or the other but you probably will empathize with one of them based on your own experiences in love and loss.  Two people fall in love, one of them falls out of love (or does she?), is anyone to blame?", "Although I didn't like April Snow, I have to admit that I got curious about it's clinical, meditative, and almost Ozu like approach to start searching out its director's previous films. One Fine Spring Day is Hur Jin Ho's second feature film. Surprisingly though, the film feels like it's been crafted by a master who's been making films for decades. One Fine Spring Day evokes a certain sense of maturity and control that deflects the low points of its spare plot. Sang woo (Yu Ji tae) is a sound engineer who lives with his father and his senile grandmother. He gets a job to record certain sounds of nature with beautiful radio DJ Eun su (Lee Young ae). Sang woo, who seems to be an extrovert and Eun su, who is more outgoing and openminded, get along very well and start a relationship. Their relationship, however, is not the type that would last forever as both characters are very different and both have issues that need to be resolved. Those seeking something that will provide for a fuzzy joyous romantic feeling would easily get disappointed with One Fine Spring Day. One Fine Spring Day, despite its rather light atmosphere, holds a bittersweet conclusion that feels all too real for comfort. It matches the joys of falling in love with the pangs of an unexplained break up. The beauty of the film doesn't emanate from the plot, or the characterizations, or even the technical merits, but from Hur's surehanded direction that never seems to stray from its melancholic tone. Hur doesn't waste time in dealing with heartwarming moments or scenes of melodramatic intensity. He satisfies himself with sincere moments of silence that somehow evoke great emotional weight. One Fine Spring Day is a lovely film. I loved the fact that it never breaks into serious drama or comedy. It stays right there, comfortable in the middle, chronicling in a very sure manner the failing relationship of the couple. It's very different from April Snow which I thought tried too hard to build up its setup with a more ominous atmosphere that bogs down whatever talent and effort Hur and the rest of his crew put in entirely."], "Sentiment Score": 0.8842857142857143}, "828": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1070": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "397": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "743": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1136": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "829": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "637": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["I love this series.

As such the film has this kind of odd intent of wanting to show how competitive life was during the age of dinosaurs, but at the same time inject a kind of family friendly children's fair to the whole thing.So it is that we see Pangea as seen through the eyes of Speckles, the Tarbosaurus, a breed of Tyrannosaur, as he and his family struggle to survive the the very unforgiving environment of the late Cretaceous period, where supersized hyper predators hunt and prey off of equally gigantic sauropods. We are spared the bloodshed, but not the hunt and the bite.And this is kind of the odd thing about this movie; all the violence is there, but not the explicit element that makes violence so abhorrent; shedding blood. Which, for a children's film, is a good thing, but one is hard pressed to gauge the violence as the actual attacks and bites are shown, as well as dinosaurs (friendly, non friendly, and hapless prey) are shown dying, attacking, or being attacked.That's kind of the duel edged nature of a movie like this. The film makers put in the presence of a family, even a romance and the rebuilding of a family to give the film a kind of life that we mere humans can relate to, but the reality of the dinosaur era was that the monsters often so referred to by scientists, were, in reality, truly monsters. They were predators that knew only one thing; they needed to kill to eat. when you go to a museum and see the skeletons of creatures of epochs long since gone, we tend to marvel at them from a distance and then put them out of our minds. But if you really thought about those times, and what the behaviors of the creatures that lived back then would have been like, it should make your shiver a little. There was no more violent time to be alive than to be a dinosaur in the mix of a predator prey relationship.So the film is successful in presenting an honest look at dinosaur lives, and doesn't pull too many punches to deliver us a children's tale. The film is, on its own level, a resounding success. But I wonder if it was wise to make such a film in the first place, one where we see dinosaurs killing other dinosaurs. Then again I thin of all the Westerns I saw as a child, and all of the gunfights and all of the actors and stunt men who played people getting shot in those movies and TV shows, and I think perhaps I'm worrying too much about this film.All in all it's a decent watch. I'm still out to lunch on deciding whether I'd let any of my children watch it. So I guess my best advice to any parent reading this review is to watch the movie yourself first, and then decide whether you think your young one can handle the action in the film.Then again, remember, hey are dinosaurs, creatures that lived a long time ago, and are thankfully gone (mostly anyway).Give it shot, and see what you think.Overall a decent movie.", "(Note, this review MAY contains Spoilers!)I remember watching this movie on YouTube two years ago. I was initially pessimistic about it, considering that this movie is Korean. As I watched more, I couldn't help but find myself liking this film. After all, I am a lover of dinosaurs and its quite badass having a Tarbosaurus as the protagonist.To start off, the story is basic: The life of a Tarbosaurus named Speckles. Initially having a happy life, his family and life is shattered when a Tyrannosaurus named One Eye appears usurps their territory, killing them in the process. What follows is the tribulations and struggle of Speckles who tries to survive during his lifetime. Overtime, we get to see his character mature as he grows up.So, what are my thoughts of this film? As stated before, I like this film. For kids, it is an enjoyable dino flick and I think the film is suitable for families of all ages. However for dino nerds and professional critics, its a hard watch as many usually point out the lack of logic and the excessive flaws of any film possible (Even the best ones).The Good: To start off, I like the character of Speckles. You can quickly empathise with him and his maturity and growth over the course of the story is very well done. Other characters include Blue Eyes (Another major character), Speckles's family and One Eye (The antagonist) who while somewhat generic, seem to serve their purpose quite well. One Eye is a character that you WILL hate, so that's a good plus for me. The animation is brilliant and that's what I think is the movie's best element, considering that Speckles was meant to be a D film. The story is simplistic, but I think it works and flows with the coming of age genre quite decently. Aside from the titular Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, there are also several dinosaurs not known to the public (E.g. Tsintaosaurus, Therizinosaurus, Pukyongosaurus and Charanosaurus) featured which I think helps the film in being colourful and more diverse in establishing different fauna. Lastly, the music of the film is superb in my opinion. It catches the mood quite effectively and provides a sense of adventure and thrill in this film.The Bad: Not every film is perfect.The same can be said for Speckles. Firstly, the film's story is shown through narration, which goes through different voice overs depending on Speckles's age. Needless to say, it was insipid (Especially the narrator for infant Speckles) and I felt it was distracting and a juvenile attempt to make the film more geared towards kids. While there is a good species number of dinosaurs in this film, its easy to point out that several of them are actually FROM North America (Tyrannosaurus, Torosaurus and Ankylosaurus for example). Some animals are even over exaggerated (One species reaching lengths of a  feet, despite being way smaller!). One Eye also seems to resemble Scar from The Lion King (Notice that BOTH have scars) and are cunning, but I'd say both are good villains in their own right.In conclusion, Speckles the Tarbosaurus results in it's pros slightly overpowering its cons to make itself known as a film kids could enjoy. There are heart warming scenes which while depressing, also makes the story a little bit more forced when it comes to empathising with Speckles, but they are sad nonetheless. For dino nerds, its a mixed bag and its a tough call when it comes to watching something realistic about dinosaurs. However, Speckles the Tarbosaurus makes for a good substitute and I'd say its an enjoyable film. For anyone who was kids who love dinosaurs, I'd say give them a watch. You'll let me know :).For my evaluation in terms of story, characters, music, animation and my own personal enjoyment, I would give Speckles a . out of ten. My best recommendation is that you should rather watch the movie on YouTube rather than just buying it. Kids will love this film and adults will find it heart warming and depressing Overall, its a good dinosaur film albeit with its own set of flaws and a nice departure from NOT using well known dinosaurs (E.g. Apatosaurus) as the protagonist, having shifted to a lesser known species (Tarbosaurus) for a boosting popularity.", "The first time I saw a trailer of this on Youtube, I thought it was something related with that Walking with Dinosaurs movie from the year . Anyway, this wasn't anything particularly memorable, having many predictable clich\u00e9s from other movies about Dinosaurs: I guess the Disneyfied plot and anthropomorphic behavior exhibited by the dinosaurs in this film would have been more tolerable if it wasn't for the incredibly annoying voice over narration, which constantly explains the viewers what is already happening on screen. Besides of being obvious and redundant, it makes all the most dramatic and intense moments of the plot to lose its effect, feeling more like a forced attempt to make the story more kid friendly. And that is a shame, because there were a couple of genuinely interesting scenes which had the potential to made this movie something much more interesting than it actually turned out to be.", "I haven't written any reviews, so this is my first.I have no idea how to feel about this movie. Its presented in a childlike way, as if its pretending to be a kiddy movie. But I think this might be the most depressing and sad movie I've ever seen...No it doesn't have blood, but it has child murder, genocide, starvation, drowning in tar, babies getting squished by rocks, whole family death, whole family death again, throwing babies off a cliff, pack hunting, killing of helpless dinos, stampedes of dinosaurs falling off cliffs, volcano erupting and balls of fire smashing running dinos, more stampedes of dinos running off cliffs, and abandoning your family to be feasted upon by rapters.This is not a kids movie.", "The animation in this movie is outstanding. Sadly, that is the end of what's good about it. It's told from the point of view of Speckles, the youngest dinosaur in the pack and that is the main problem. They put a tremendous amount of work into creating a incredible graphics, a photo realistic world to depict the violent life of the dinosaurs and then used a anthropomorphized child's voice with horrible dialog that sounds like its from a PBS kids show as the main narration. Imagine watching Jurassic Park with Fifel the Mouse narrating the movie for the first third of the film and you get the picture. Eventually, the voice get older as Speckles get older but the dialog gets no better and the story becomes ridiculous (including showing a Tarbosaurus (similar to a Tyrannosaurus) cliff dive into the ocean). While it's not a documentary, it would have been better served with adult documentary like narration. That change alone would have made this movie more watchable. No narration would have been better and made this movie much more watchable."], "Sentiment Score": 0.6163636363636363}, "1334": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "723": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "30": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["This is the most enjoyable TV series I have seen in a while I am absolutely loving it would highly recommend hope it comes out top it certainly deserves too give it top marks love the story and the couple would score more if possible", "Top actress (Oh Yoon Seo) falls on twos years of rock bottom hard times from her rich boyfriend's drug scandal.

Plus it has been a huge critical and commercial hit in Korea, so I'm surprised there aren't more Korean movie fans on here giving it positive reviews!For those looking to get into Korean cinema this movie offers a nice alternative from the dark films that Korea tends to be known for internationally. While I enjoy some of these darker films like Oldboy, Mother, and I Saw the Devil, it's refreshing to see a Korean film that doesn't leave you feeling sick or depressed after the curtain falls.This movie has the usual themes covered in coming of age stories, but also deals with other issues relevant to modern Korean society, such as the treatment of foreign laborers and the disabled by a Korean culture that isn't always welcoming to outsiders. All that said, the highlight of this movie is the relationship between Wan Deuki and his teacher. This is the source of a great deal of humor and warmth throughout the movie, and will make you laugh out loud more than other Korean movie I can think of.

This movie is not like any other Korean film that I have watched, but it is a lot like the Japanese classic Ping Pong and it is a lot like American coming of age films such as The Freshman, Breaking Away and The Graduate and the Australian movies Muriel's Wedding and Strictly Ballroom, i.e. there are plenty of belly laughs, a few tearful moments and a sense that what you are watching is universal.Anyone who watches this looking for another Shamo (I love Shamo, btw) or similar martial arts film will be disappointed. While it starts on a downer note, it ends on a spiritual emotional intellectual high. I can not praise it highly enough.

The humor is just really bland in this movie and the story isn't anything special. The only thing that stands out is how there are actually these types of students living in Korea so it can be relatable. The building of the bond between the student and the teacher goes in a pretty much narrow direction. I was more interested in the romance between the teacher and the next door neighbor.

This series is handled with a certain delicacy; a restraint that doesn't prevent or hold back, but depicts the tender beauty of two people in love. I submit that a viewer may find it very difficult to pass judgment, for how does one justify judging love? Can love be judged?To the naive viewer, Sunjae Lee is a young man, barely , who thinks and feels with his hormones. This is a gross misinterpretation and understanding of who he is. Sunjae Lee is a simple young man who knows how to do things in only one way: with love and passion. A gifted pianist, Sunjae is able to captivate his audiences, whether they be a concert hall or a few listeners, not with just the beauty of his play, but with the heart and passion he puts into it. Several viewers are so captivated by his play, that he moves them to tears. It is a bit ironic that a young man of  already knows the secret to love and living simply.Oh Hyewon is a middle aged woman, approximately twenty years older than Sunjae. A renowned pianist when she was Sunjae's age, she has now found herself pulled into the world of wealth and power. She works for a Seohan Art Institute as an executive accountant. She loves the life that her money buys for her, and she has long forgotten the passion and her own love for music. She is married to a university professor, who also works for the institute. They share a house and a life that is more like those of roommates than of spouses. There is little tenderness or warmth in their relationship or in their house, which looks like a cold bastille atop the street. It is somewhat ironic that the only room in the house that has any warmth at all, is the music room.Sunjae's talent is soon discovered, and he's asked to come over to the professor's house to play. Hyewon is asked to listen, given her musical background. Immediately, she is taken back to a time when she used to share the same love and passion for music that Sunjae has. Hyewon can't help but be enamored by the young man, unable to realize that she has already captivated him.There is a certain degree of irony in their relationship, in which Hyewon attempts to teach Sunjae about her world; the world of power and treachery. It is a world that is completely foreign to Sunjae, and he already realizes that he wants no part of it. He is not interested in money or acquiring things. And yet, it is his simple and complete way of loving, that makes him Hyewon's teacher in that regard. The acting performances are all first rate, especially those of Ah in Yoo (Sunjae) and Hui ai Kim (Hyewon). The relationship between these two characters is handled deftly, like a piano piece...full of love, beauty, and grace. Viewers may find themselves longing for their own Sunjae...someone who can love so unequivocally and unconditionally as Sunjae can. His love is all the more profound in the little things that he does to ensure her comfort. One cannot mention this series without the incredible musical performances. Nearly every episode has a piano piece that seems to perfectly coincide with the feelings of Sunjae and Hyewon. Watching this series is like listening to a long concert, and by the end, you feel all the better for it!", "I loved this series on Netflix. The tension caused by the two leading actors is fantastic. The clothing worn by Hui Ae Kim and the luxurious surroundings are a sight to behold. it was lovely to see the politeness of Koreans which is similar to the Japanese in fashion. If you like classical music you should love this series as there is a good deal of it. I found Hui Ae Kim very exotic and sensual as she learns to deal with her feelings. Ah in Yoo is very good as the object of her fascination.", "I love this drama so much that I wrote my first review in IMDb. I found the show from Netflix. This is a story about how a young, poor, talented pianist (Lee Sun jae) fell in love with his teacher (Oh Hye won.) Oh Hye won was a married woman, who entered the marriage out of calculation to advance her social status. In fact, her life was full of calculation until Lee Sun jae entered her life. Lee Sun Jae, a young man who was madly in love with Oh Hye won, was not afraid of how their love was seen in other people's eyes. He just wanted Hye won to love him back with honesty. I was really impressed by the production quality of the show. Yoo Ah In (as Lee Sun jae)'s acting was stunning. He depicted a shy yet fearless young man precisely. His acting was a package: not only through his words and eyes, but also his eye brows, his mouth, and all his body languages. Kissing scenes are common in drama, but passion from him was the most contagious. I have also watched other older drama by Yoo Ah in. Secret Love Affair was the better one. Kim Hee ae (Oh Hye won) was an outstanding actress so the chemistry between the two was able to shine. When they were playing piano, you can feel the emotions between them. It is like music is where they could talk about their love loudly without any concerns of the world. The directing and music were so beautiful that I kept replaying the show after I have finished the show. I like how the show makes you wonder what is considered moral or not. Secret love affair is of course immoral in the eye of the society. But is a marriage based on interests really purer? However, I wasn't a big fan of the latter part of the story ,which was full of the obnoxious calculation and loud augments among those who were hungry for status and money. This part seemed to fall back to the typical format of Korean Drama....", "This is one of KDrama's best series with two fine actors in the leads. Yoo Ah In was actually several years older than the age of the character he plays, so his capturing of the gawkiness and hesitancy of the youth is particularly noteworthy, as is the character's gradual maturing and literally taking the lead in the relationship. We also must compliment the actors' memorizing the piano pieces. They and the professional OST are amazing. I could have done without the side plots as I just wanted the love story because it is so touching.", "I've watched over a hundred kdramas, and this is in my top . The story is about the relationship between a young piano prodigy and his mentor, and the piano playing is the best of any cinematic portrayal I know of. Their relationship is based on a shared love for music and his fascination with his very sophisticated mentor. She is in a loveless marriage, and gradually succumbs to his emotional directness and honesty. Those who are put off by the idea of a younger man older woman relationship won't like this series for that reason, but anyone open to an unusual relationship should love the combination of sophisticated realism, romance, and great music."], "Sentiment Score": 0.9950000000000001}, "830": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1295": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1234": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "22": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["I don't write reviews for series very often, and definitely not for ones I haven't even finished, but this drama is such an exception for me that I feel like I have to tell everyone I know how much I love it.

The romance is cute and all the characters are very entertaining, with strong personalities (even the small side characters manage to be easy to remember).

The driver who hit the car, actually aimed at killing both father and child, however the main actress was present and even though she was intimidated into not going to court to testify whether the accident was no accident, she did go. The series starts basically from the point both main actors grew up. It is interesting how they meet, how they work together and how they protect one another. I would suggest this series to anyone as I believe it can match the tastes of any viewer.", "I have always loved court room dramas and legal thrillers  books, movies, soaps and sitcoms. I like those well written scripts that take advantage of the loopholes in law to build powerful twists in the plots, keeping the audience or viewers engaged till the end. 'I hear your voice' is a romantic comedy  my most favorite of Korean drama genres, with the right amount of courtroom cases, and a bit of fantasy. The episodes were an easy watch, interesting and entertaining. He is a high school kid who can hear people's thoughts. These extra voices in his ears make his world noisier. She is a lawyer  a public defender, quite a few years older than him. She is his first love. He admired her since she came as a witness of his father's murder to the trial  years ago. Searching for her when he grew up, he found her on the pages of a newspaper. Then as they became closer, from just acquaintances in a case, he starts helping her during trials  by reading everyone's minds; and she takes the responsibility of his guardian.

However, the makers of the drama refused and said they couldn't and quite frankly, I'm happy they did.

The leads are all very attractive people (especially the awesome and incredibly handsome Ji seob So as Mu hyeok and the little dynamo Su jeong Im, who was great in the Korean hit film A Tale Of Two Sisters), and their acting is realistic and evocatively emotional, and often funny as well. The music is beautiful too and the production values are excellent. It was filmed in Australia and Korea.It's the story of a petty gangster, Mu hyeok   a street hustler growing up homeless in Australia, who is shot in the head at the wedding of a woman he loved. She was marrying a rich gangster for his money, yet Mu hyeok, still deeply in love with her, risks his own life to save hers when an assassin shows up to kill the wedding couple.The doctors cannot remove the bullet in Mu hyeok's brain, and they give him only a few months to live. The woman he saved gives him a lot of money and tells him to return to his homeland of Korea to die. He goes and makes a search for his birth mother whom he believes gave him up for adoption because of financial hardship. When he finds her he is shocked to discover she is rich, has another son, and so he doesn't reveal to her his identity but instead plans his revenge on her.Along the way he discovers he has a twin sister, and he falls in love with a gentle girl named Eunchae Song who works for his step brother. Over time he begins a mellowing process. Will he cling to bitterness until the end of his life, or will he find the grace to forgive those he believed wronged him? Many surprises are in store for the viewer during this series, right up to the last scenes. There is also some wonderful humor to relieve the dramatic tension. I really loved this show and everyone I have recommended it to has become as hooked as I was! It's just as addictive as those famous British   PBS series such as Upstairs, Downstairs or The Forsyte Saga or The Duchess of Duke Street! Except the stars are all Korean! Now, there are several ways to buy this awesome series. You can order each episode off Amazon On Demand for $. each, but the files have DRM copyright protection on them so you'll only be able to watch them on your computer. These are good quality files with excellent white subtitles in English.Or you can buy a  disc box set from KBSDVD, which is out of print now but worth tracking down because it has the best images (though the subtitles are not as good as the Amazon video files).Then there is another KBS release that is only  discs, but the images have been condensed to MPEG files instead of proper MPEG files, so I suggest you avoid this one. The yellow subtitles in this box set are terrible in comparison to your other options. Ask the seller how many discs are in the set you wish to buy.Yet another box set with  DVDs is available in Korea, but you're not going to find that selling here in the States because it is Region .However you track it down, don't miss it.

Featuring structures of the traditional 'bildungsroman', snapshots into the grueling lives of salary men and office politics, the show intertwines these concepts with humour, emotion, reflectiveness, wisdom, finely executed through a fitting soundtrack, impeccable cinematography and directing and outstanding acting. A solid show thematically, it handles with great sensitivity and deftness the many delicately captured aspects of human nature and society. The characters and their development throughout the story are extremely well written and by far one of the most impressive aspects of the show, fleshed out by the complexity and subtle nuance of the relationships depicted. Entirely believable in both their strengths and vulnerabilities, the show allows an audience to connect with the characters on a very fundamental level. You will find something of yourself, or someone that you know reflected in the characters of the show, the persistent underdog in Gurae who struggles against all odds, the talented but down to earth Young Yi whose exceptional ability as a woman incurs the resentment of her colleagues, the at first seemingly stoic Oh Sang Sik who over the course of the show reveals his deep capacity for empathy and self sacrifice. Even the 'villains' are never clich\u00e9, one dimensional cardboard cutouts to fill a gap in the story, but all serve towards Misaeng's intimate and moving exploration of the human condition. Misaeng shows many aspects of mundane life, but never itself, becomes mundane, taking the viewer on a at times beautifully poignant, vividly evocative and greatly inspiring journey from start to finish. As I believe this is a show that leaves a viewer of any demographic something to take away, I'd urge anyone reading this to give it a try. For me, Misaeng certainly gave another small unexpected fragment to the missing pieces of my 'incomplete life.'", "So far, I have seen three Korean dramas that have blown me away. Descendants of the Sun, Stranger, and now Misaeng. Misaeng is about four interns, hoping to secure jobs in the Korean trading company, One International. Those unfamiliar with how Koreans do business may easily find themselves intrigued and sometimes disgusted with the Korean working environment. Still mostly a male dominated work environment, you will see that it is still a difficult and challenging place for women to break into. Being verbally abused, and even occasionally sexually harassed, despite the company guidelines forbidding it, women take on the challenge of having to put up with it while trying to climb the corporate ladder.A group of interns are working at One International with the hope of securing a permanent position through a contract offer. Of course, the four interns that the series focuses on, all come from different backgrounds and have differing personality traits. What makes them interesting is that they are all complex characters, causing the viewer to find certain things endearing about each one as well as things you may be turned off by. Sounds like real life, right? And that is just one of the charms that makes this series work so well.First, we have Geu Rae, a highly introverted young man, who doesn't have much of an educational background. His resume is full of small, part time jobs that cause his fellow interns to contemptuously wonder how he got the internship in the first place. Especially contemptuous is fellow intern, Baek Gi. Unknown to most of his co workers and even his supervisors, Geu Rae is a champion in the classic game of bad uk (Go). Somehow, he is able to utilize bad uk strategies to help him solve problems. He is also able to take criticisms without taking them personally. He knows he's there due to connections, and not because of any ability that he has. Geu Rae, therefore, knows that he has to prove himself by working even harder than any of the other interns. Next is Young yi, portrayed by the beautifully capable So ra Kang as the only female intern. She is dedicated, and she already has much knowledge about the trading business. She is also able to speak several languages fluently. However, she has to take the abuse from her male colleagues, forcing her to do nothing more than retrieve coffee, get their shoes cleaned, and so forth. Somehow, she is able to do these things long enough to prove to them, that she's highly capable and only wants to serve and support her team. I cannot imagine how it must be for a Korean woman trying to succeed in such an environment where she is derided and taking constant abuse. To make matters worse, her own father tells her that he regrets that she wasn't born a boy. Baek Gi is the ambitious intern who is a bit prim and proper. He's a bit arrogant, and feels that certain jobs are beneath him. It takes him a while to understand why there is a learning curve in place and also to learn how to be humble and supportive. When Geu rae, at one point, appears to be getting more recognition than him, Baek Gi doesn't take it well as his resentment builds toward Geu rae...until he finally learns the truth about Geu rae's past. Baek Gi starts off as a very unlikable character, but he quickly grows on you.Seok Ryul is the wild, passionate, and somewhat lazy intern, who'd rather spend his time gawking at girls than working. However, his strength lies in his knowledge of the working factory man; the blue collar workers who slave away, often in unfavorable conditions and with outdated equipment, in the company factories. He's also a bit resistant to authority, especially if he feels that he's being taken advantage of. However, he loves his fellow interns, and his friendship with all of them is important to him.The power of this series is in the relationships between, not only the interns, but also with their co workers. These are people who spend more time with each other than with their own families. Comradery is important to them , and they often work late hours or go out for drinks together after work.The heart and soul of this series, rests with Mr. Sang shik Oh (stellar performance by Sung min Lee, who all but steals the series!), who is Geu rae's boss of Sales Team Three. At first, Mr. Oh is reluctant and even a bit hesitant to help Geu rae learn the job due to his lack of qualifications and experience. However, upon seeing Geu rae's willingness to learn the job as well as his determination, Mr. Oh relents. More than that, he takes Geu rae under his wing, and we quickly find that the two characters have a love and a respect for each other that is quite touching and heart warming. Geu rae, who has been alone much of his life, finds a father figure in Mr. Oh. We see our cast of characters dealing with one obstacle after another, as they struggle in the workplace; a place that is sometimes friendly, sometimes hostile, and always competitive. The stories are first rate as well as the actors who bring these fascinating characters to light. You'll laugh, you'll cheer, and you'll occasionally even find yourself choking back tears. You'll quickly adhere yourself to characters that you love, and despise those that you don't. In the end, I think most people would love to have a boss like Mr. Oh who demonstrates wonderful integrity, despite the back dealings, and money grubbing traits of many of the greedy managers around him. He looks after all of the interns, and he has no problem tripping those who abuse them in very funny situations. Misaeng shouldn't be missed or overlooked. This series has it all.", "I can't keep writing and talking, and writing and talking, and writing and talking about Misaeng over and over again for days. I must say if u have'nt watch this drama, go watch it !! it's a drama that i rarely seen on k drama world. i can't stop thinking about the motivations behind the characters, about how certain events complicated others, about how to put it all together. It's just well written, well directed and well prepared in details The ending it self it's so..... reasonable. As in life everything happened for a reason, and thats how nicely the story wrapped. After all, Misaeng is Incomplete Life and we are all incomplete lifes trying to become complete, Thats how Misaeng change my opinion about k drama <", "I've had my doubts when checking out the cast   it sure looked like an office romance to me, but man, I was wrong.This is not romance nor is it a mere office soap. It's about people working in an office and the moments they share with each other. You got each office type you'd meet in real life portrayed as realistitc as possible for a drama series. You get to know each person's flaws even and yet you never end up fully hating on anyone. Every person has a believable storyline, motives, motivations.On a sidenote, I'm an offive employee as well. Most of Misaeng is what my life is about   the work, the colleagues, the problems and epically funny moments, the bullying, the psychos, the coffee breaks... Wish I was as ambitious as Jang Gu Rae, but mostly I enjoyed his naivety when facing problems and his loyalty towards Oh Sang Shik and his colleagues. My favourite characters would be Oh Sang Shik, Kang Hae Joon and Han Seok Yool. I remember my first job as an intern and that first boss. The only boss so far I've ever actually looked up to (well, before that I'd worked at schools which was a completely different experience anyhow). Oh Sang Shik reminded me of my boss, the only boss I've ever met that was absolutely loyal and who everyone was loyal to because of that. I've learnt alot from him and will always be grateful. Manager Kang, oh well, not gonna lie, I have a weakness for people like that and I loved his taste in women   I think this is the manager I'd definitely learn the most from. \nWhile on the other hand, Seok Yool, that one co worker you really need in an office, who has more empathy than anyone else, yet sometimes seems like a dork. He's that good soul that'll keep the group together no matter what.I don't really want to go to work tomorrow, it's a heck load of work and people are sick these days, so it's more work for those who aren't on sick leave   but I feel motivated after finishing Misaeng.  would recommend because Misaeng has that spark   that charisma that so many k dramas are missing.", "This is a beautifully done simple story about an office, teamwork and relationships.

First of all the scenery was winter which made it perfect for the characters to dress fashionably. The characters were also really cool. I liked the way the characters were all very extreme, and that there were no boring characters. You either liked the character in the drama or you hated their guts. The music (noon ae kouth snow flower) in this drama is awesome too.In addition, this series is not too long ( episodes), so you could watch it in just one day. The drama is good from the start, but there was one part that I did not like, which was the episodes  and . But the ending of episode ... !!! but the ending of episode  really gets you back into the series. Another thing that I did not like about the series was that in about  scenes the microphone can be seen. However, this drama is truly still the best I have ever scene and I have shown this drama to my family and friends, and none have not liked it.

The storyline is unique and the acting by the two main leads are nothing short of outstanding. It focuses on a mother's love for her child and how human beings are inevitably, soft hearted creatures.This Drama originally planned to be screened only for  episodes, the netizens of Korea demanded an extension and KBS complied by asking the drama's directors and producers to extend by another  episodes. However, the makers of the drama refused and said they couldn't and quite frankly, I'm happy they did. In fact, the drama was so popular that KBS even issued a second OST album for it due to overwhelming response. Not to mention that the last two episodes were so sad, that even the makers of the drama couldn't help but cry when the scenes were played out I don't have the vocabulary to describe So Ji Sup's performance in 'Misa'. I had watched him in 'Memories of Bali' and always knew that he was good. But this time he really outdid all of us.So Ji Sup is just perfect for Cha Moo Hyuk With comparisons to her co star, I loved Im Soo Jung from top to bottom. She was very much what her character required to portray: A simple minded girl without her own dreams. In the beginning, Eun Chae desired whatever Choi Yoon desired, because Choi Yoon was the epitome of her life. But once she got to know Moo Hyuk, that changed forever. I'm Sorry I Love You has a deeper meaning throughout the normal K dramas we see about love. It dwells more on the humanity of a person", "I'm Sorry, I Love You () was a  episode, huge television hit series made by Koreans, but popular all throughout the Asian world.Slightly soap opera ish in nature, it is an extremely addictive show because it develops its plot lines slowly and you really begin to care about the characters. The leads are all very attractive people (especially the awesome and incredibly handsome Ji seob So as Mu hyeok and the little dynamo Su jeong Im, who was great in the Korean hit film A Tale Of Two Sisters), and their acting is realistic and evocatively emotional, and often funny as well. The music is beautiful too and the production values are excellent. It was filmed in Australia and Korea.It's the story of a petty gangster, Mu hyeok   a street hustler growing up homeless in Australia, who is shot in the head at the wedding of a woman he loved. She was marrying a rich gangster for his money, yet Mu hyeok, still deeply in love with her, risks his own life to save hers when an assassin shows up to kill the wedding couple.The doctors cannot remove the bullet in Mu hyeok's brain, and they give him only a few months to live. The woman he saved gives him a lot of money and tells him to return to his homeland of Korea to die. He goes and makes a search for his birth mother whom he believes gave him up for adoption because of financial hardship. When he finds her he is shocked to discover she is rich, has another son, and so he doesn't reveal to her his identity but instead plans his revenge on her.Along the way he discovers he has a twin sister, and he falls in love with a gentle girl named Eunchae Song who works for his step brother. Over time he begins a mellowing process. Will he cling to bitterness until the end of his life, or will he find the grace to forgive those he believed wronged him? Many surprises are in store for the viewer during this series, right up to the last scenes. There is also some wonderful humor to relieve the dramatic tension. I really loved this show and everyone I have recommended it to has become as hooked as I was! It's just as addictive as those famous British   PBS series such as Upstairs, Downstairs or The Forsyte Saga or The Duchess of Duke Street! Except the stars are all Korean! Now, there are several ways to buy this awesome series. You can order each episode off Amazon On Demand for $. each, but the files have DRM copyright protection on them so you'll only be able to watch them on your computer. These are good quality files with excellent white subtitles in English.Or you can buy a  disc box set from KBSDVD, which is out of print now but worth tracking down because it has the best images (though the subtitles are not as good as the Amazon video files).Then there is another KBS release that is only  discs, but the images have been condensed to MPEG files instead of proper MPEG files, so I suggest you avoid this one. The yellow subtitles in this box set are terrible in comparison to your other options. Ask the seller how many discs are in the set you wish to buy.Yet another box set with  DVDs is available in Korea, but you're not going to find that selling here in the States because it is Region .However you track it down, don't miss it. It's literally the most addictive show I've watched in years and years. I love it!  stars out of .", "A soulful performance by the lead actor So Ji Sub makes this series worth watching. This could have been your average Korean melodrama however, the sincere, soulful and heartfelt performance by So Ji Sub elevates this melodrama to the highest degree. Sorry, I Love You is a journey of a young man who transforms from a minor vengeful petty thief into a decent caring human being. So Ji Sub's transformation throughout the series is quite remarkable, he displays great sadness and longing for love and acceptance. Lim Su jeong who plays the unlikely love interest also gives a tender and genuine performance. Overall, the series has a rather karmic and dark message about whatever comes around goes around. Su jeong's father ends up suffering the most for giving up the twin babies and keeping the secret from the lead character's mother. It's not your average K Drama the message of the drama is at the very end of the series. Great story writing and great acting by So Ji Sub makes this series one of the best K Dramas.

Dozen of call girls are disappeared and never returned when they visited unknown customer. The serial killer also murdered innocent old men and women on his loose. After caught of serial killer the revealed fact was beyond one's imagination. He killed girls with hammer, chisel and amputated the victims. Some of them were cannibalized. He mashed victim's liver with food processors and drank it. Now the serial killer is sentenced to death and his existence throw serious questions about execution of death sentenced prisoner to the Korean society. For ten years Korean government never executed prisoners and now UN approved Korea as a No Execution country.This movie is a product of these social circumstance. Of course any modernized country can have notorious serial killers. But this is most brutal and abominable criminal act as reported to the public.Another phenomena described in this movie are the inactive police act and ugly politician. Koreans are very disappointed at this and this movie is quite accurately visualized the situation.Whether or not crime is the best motif for movie and this movie successfully hold the breath of viewers. I am waiting another movie from this director.Good work.", "What a movie. When I rented this movie I didn't know what to expect. It is usually is a hit or miss for Korean movies but this was a grand slam out of the park type of movie. The film is about a former detective turn pimp trying to catch a serial killer who is killing his prostitutes. It's a big cat and mouse game between the two throughout the whole movie. The plot sounds thin but there is so much more than what meets the eye. This is one of the best thriller serial killer movies I have ever seen and I don't want to say too much about the plot because it is very edge of your seat kind of stuff. The film never drags and it becomes more intriguing the more you watch and you feel like you know the character because the actors portray them so well. This is a very violent and gruesome film that shouldn't be viewed by the squeamish even though there isn't that many bloody scenes for being a serial killer movie. The movie achieves so much more with less, which hardly ever works in films that need violence to be a success. I wish that Hollywood or even European films would have the brass to make a film this unique and daring at the same time. The thing that this film has going for it the most is that it's wonderfully erratic. You can never guess what is going to happen next and that is the reason why Korean movies are so fantastically entertaining. I rank this movie in my top three greatest thriller serial killer movies of all time somewhere between Seven and Silence of the Lambs. The characters of this film really flesh out the story and let you jump right in. I can't help but stress the point that this film is very unpredictable and the style of the story telling is subtle but very effective. This film is a sure bet and you will not leave disappointed.", "If the remake of Infernal Affairs (The Departed) won all those Oscars then a re make of this movie will surely clean up. Its one of those movies that just doesn't let up. At any given time there are at least three threads to the story, each of which keeps you on the edge of your seat. I actually had to stop it at one point so I could calm down a bit.The acting by everyone involved is very believable and that makes it quite harrowing at points. I don't want to give away a single thing about the story but what I can say is that its an absolutely brilliant twist on a story that has been done many times before.If you are going to see just one foreign film this year then let it be this one.", "Korean cinema does it again. The Chaser is another great movie from the Korean film stable. The plot stems around an amoral ex cop turned pimp who after losing some of his working girls decides to track down and find the client behind this. He ends up finding himself involved in more than he bargained for, with the client being a serial killer, and its then a chase to find his last girl sent to him whilst the police also try to pin him down but are hampered by legal red tape and politics.As you'd expect from a Korean film from the cop thriller genre it can be very violent, and there's no denying that for this film, however thankfully it doesn't overshadow the rest of the movie. The chase is on, and the roller coaster of emotions following the pimp and the cops trying to stop the serial killer is nothing less than gripping, watching them go from one success to despair in short spaces of time. The tension is high and will tug on you right to the end.Importantly there is a lot of humour. The main character (Joong ho Eom) is incredibly dry witted, and is a release valve for the tension in the film. As he carries the film, the acting is important, and both he and the serial killer are exceptionally good. Can't argue with either or even the general ensemble.There is possibly an American re make in the offing. Fair enough I guess as that's become the norm now, but I hope it doesn't dilute the central story or the action. This film is a great gem, and follows on from some of the other greats in the genre such as Memories of a Murder which is a classic. It will unsettle but for an intelligent thriller, it really is up there with the best in the past few years.", "After the two very positive comments I decided to watch this movies. At this point the movie has  votes. So I didn't expect much from the movie. I was asking myself the question: How can a movie from South Korea with only  votes deserve a ,?

From that point on, the movie never loses your grip. Never get's dull. Always keeps you right on the edge of your chair. For the rest, you really gotta see it. I won't spoil any of your viewing pleasure by telling you too much about the story.The other comment said something about a horror element, and a bit gore. But in my opinion there is no horror.

Song Hye Kyo showed everyone again that even a simple storyline like this which is one dimensional, can be beautiful to watch. She found a good comrade in Park Bo Gum.

Every time Hye Kyo had tears in her eyes, she made me cry(and i never cry watching dramas btw). She is the most beautiful crier I have ever seen in dramas.\nPark Bo Gum played the role of a handsome man in his late twenties who is more mature than his peers of the same age.

And i also hope that Park be more able and has exceptional wit to help Song on her hotel business. So he will be more musculine.All the episodes develops just on their romance. The whole drama is one dimemsional and is not rich in content. The Cuba setting can just bring excitement for the first two episodes.A foreign setting and a supersar casting is not enough to make a good drama. Especially for this drama Song is older than Park, there will not be many kisses and romantic scenes like typical love drama. I expect the writer would add something special to compensate for the age gap. Like Mr Sunshine the age gap are compensated with beautiful shooting, great war scene, amazing costume. In Boyfriend we do not see anything special worth praising.Anyway the acting of the lead couple is above standard. They are both so famous and must have some attractiveness by their own character.

I shed a few tears by the films end and was thinking about it for days afterward.It's a heck of a debut from Yang Ik Joon who wrote, directed, produced and takes the lead role as well.Joon plays a small time hood debt collector who doesn't mess about with customers who owe money. No one is safe it seems from his fists or his foul mouth, not even his nephew. A chance meeting with a high school student results in an unlikely friendship. We learn more about both characters as the film builds momentum. Suffice to say that their main link is both being exposed to domestic violence.Joon fleshes out the story and gives all characters a chance to shine. The acting is first rate as is the screenplay which apparently is autobiographical.Anyone easily upset by violence or profanity would be well advised to give this one a miss.I hope it finds an audience and gets a wide release. I certainly look forward to more films in the future from this exciting young director writer actor.", "Having been to Korea on numerous occasions I went out of my way to ensure I saw this film at the  Vancouver International Film Festival and I am very happy that I did.As this is Yang Ik Joon's first full length picture here is a presentation that is shown in true raw passion and with emotion. I found the movie and it's engaging story line to be very powerful. The audience and I laughed at the dark humour contained within then cried as the eventuality of the plot is brought to bear.For those that can stomach the violence I highly recommend finding this film to view. The movie takes place in a world that most of us are simply not willing to face however the issues presented therein relating to abuse are very important and very relevant.Every action has consequence and truly each of our lives glow so bright before we fade.I hope that one day Breathless (Ddongpari) can be given a Region  DVD release so that I may purchase and watch again."], "Sentiment Score": 0.7824999999999999}, "922": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["I've seen a couple of Korean' dramas. Maybe they are a bit cheesy sometimes or not so sophisticated but they have a kind of purity, a world than can be easily loved and not so sick, perverse than we experience often in these days living in the 'western part' of the planet and wathcing 'western' series.This Korean drama is a kind of Romeo and Juliet story and I apologise to say this but in this meaning the old Shakespeare drama is nowhere comparing to this   at least for me. Even Zefireli's movie is nowhere comparing to this (however it was a beautiful movie).Outstanding musics, professional performance of actors and actresses. They were just as good as the best of UK's.

The more I saw of this young actor, The more impressed I was by him. I would follow that up by the performances Lee Min Woo as Jung Jong and Hong Soo Hyun as Princess Kyung Hye I loved the developing relationship between these two, and it was one of my favourite parts of this drama. Predictable? probably. but still lovely to watch. Regarding Jung jong's character, I could see that he would have more steel, than you were supposed to think. My other favourite part of the drama was Moon Chae Won as Lee Se Ryung confrontation with Kim Young Chul as her father Prince Suyang (later King Sejo) This was me was surprising to see in a korean drama. Another first was the gay guy. I've seen gay characters in Thai Lakoprns. But I can't recall seeing an openly gay character in a K drama before. I also liked the fact that Kim Roe Ha as Jo Suk Joo was a better fighter than the hero. I found the performance of the two leads ie the aforementioned Moon Chae Won, and Park Shi Hoo as Kim Seung Yoo to be fine. She was probably better than him. But I would say that Song Jong Ho as Shin Myun was better than Park Shi Hoo The ending. At first I had the wrong idea. So the king and his wife are going somewhere. The king spots somebody who looks like supposedly our hero Kim Seung Yoo. So seeing as the king looks so old, I thought the guy he spotted was Kim Seung Yoo's son. But now, it turns out it's actually him. Okay, that's fine, but he din't look that much older. Also The king aka the main villain is now portrayed at the end of the drama as a kindly old man. It#s like seeing Hitler turn into Santa Claus. But when watching the ending. I didn't think it was a bad one. For me it certainly wasn't a predictable ending, but for that ending the villain had his character completely changed. So the ending is good, in basically letting the villain get away with what he did. But bad in that it conveniently forgets what kind of character he was.

It's not. It is every bit as brilliant, and as large, as Memories of Murder, in my opinion.In many ways this is the natural, and equal, follow up to Memories of Murder. It's every bit the caper film that one was, and, although slightly more somber in tone, the film keeps unraveling in directions you don't expect making it much more a plot driven movie than a character study. Kim Hye ja is, however, magnificent as the titular (gawd I hate that word but I'm using it anyway) mother. There is a scene in this film where she tells the family of the victim her son didn't do it and her eyes are so electrically charged it made me jump back from the screen. Mother fires on all cylinders. The direction, cinematography, script, and acting are all grade A. It's one of those films where each of the secondary characters steals the show for a brief period. (How 'bout that cop who kicks the apple from Won Bin's mouth?) Bong does a remarkable job of populating the world of this film with real people and manages to give them depth and development in a very short period of time. I confess to having a little trouble tracking the other female characters in the film, but no matter. There is a scene (without spoiling anything here) where Kim Hye ja asks the other 'retarded' kid if he has a mother and it's one of the most complex and heart rending scenes in cinematic history. Hyperbole notwithstanding, just freakin' WOW! on that one when you ponder just why she is crying.I wasn't sure where Bong was going to end up going as a film maker. Barking Dogs Never Bite was a reasonable debut. Memories of Murder, a masterpiece. But was it a lucky shot? I'm glad I don't have to consider the dismal Antarctic Journal a Bong film if I don't want to. The Host was lots o fun, but that's the one that worried me. Maybe he was going to start making blockbuster type films. But now, after recently seeing his contribution to Tokyo!, and now Mother, I have every reason to believe he is going to kick my butt with interesting film for a long time.", "Joon Ho Bong is one of the most exciting and wonderful storytellers coming out of Asia today. With Mother, he joins with Chanwook Park as being one of THE young South Korean directors to see   by that I mean anything they put out. Bong's work is layered with the skill of comedy and drama, both often so dark and thick that you can put your hand in and not feel the bottom. His previous film The Host showed his talent at making a 'popular' entertainment, a monster blockbuster that actually gave characters to care about while action and terror ensued. But this time he returns to his second feature, Memories of Murder, in crafting a murder mystery that is ultimately, in the sense of the details of the story, hopeless, but carries so much joy and passion in its making that I left elated by the performances and cinematography.It is, from the look of the premise, pretty simple stuff. A kid who is sort of 'simple' (not really retarded, just slower than the rest of the pack with a bad memory) is charged with a murder of a teenage girl found hanging over a rooftop. He says he didn't do it, or at least doesn't think he did, and his mother believes him. But finding out what happened won't be easy, and the police (as in Memories of Murder) just want the confession quick, which they get from Do joon's misunderstanding, and move along to the next case. So, the Mother goes on a mystery, like a detective first tracking his shady golf hustler friend, then going on to who this girl who died actually was, what her connections were, who, if anyone, saw what happened when her son stumbled home drunk that fateful night.All of the details, seemingly straightforward. It's all in the presentation of the details, and it's this how Bong sets himself apart as an original: taking elements of film noir and Greek tragedy, of a mother trying to save her son, and by proxy herself, and warding off the chorus of a strange and untrustworthy townsfolk who shun her after the incident. Oh, and like in other Bong films there's some touches of pitch black humor  watch for that interrogation scene of the teenage punk on the ferris wheel, or how that crazy hit and run happens at the start of the film  but it's either subtle or pronounced so large that one almost puts it down to hysterics. But while Bong navigates the black comic elements well, it's his skill as a Hitchcock cum Chabrol idolizer that makes it a must see.This is suspenseful film making, from the overall arc of finding out the details of the crime, to little moments that are just suffocating. Take when the Mother goes to search the complex lowlife Jin Tae's place to find possible proof that he committed the murder. She has to hide in the closet when he comes in (Blue Velvet much?), and watch as Jin Tae and his girlfriend have sex. Later, she has to exit ever so slightly, and knocks over a water bottle. Every second of this counts, and it's thanks to Bong's trust in the view to be lead along, and go for the tension, that makes it work.Other things that make the film so exceptional are more technical, and emotional. The performances by Hye ja Kim and Bin Won are moving for how they appear to be, then little by little how they show who they are, and more importantly what they're capable of. The final reel of the film shows the characters, and by proxy the actors, having to go through some rough motions, and a twist that makes Oldboy look, well, almost on par in comparison. Kim is sensitive, tough, smart, but also knowing of this Mother's faults as a person, that she may have a little of the 'simple' side of her own son, and the secret her character carries, when reveals, is shocking. And Bin, playing a simple kid with some deep rooted problems (and, of course, never call the character 'retard'), makes him human and relatable, or as Kirk Lazarus might put it half retard.The cinematography, lastly, is a knockout. Scenes like the opening image of the Mother in a field doing an unlikely dance to the diegetic music, and then how the DoP manages between light and dark in those night scenes, or the subtle scenes like when the lawyer has the Mother at a drinking party that goes sour fast, are just beautiful and strange to look at. This may, too, be a credit to Bong as a director. Again, following along on his previous films, he grows as a patient storyteller, ready to let the details or action of a scene go slowly, but also ready to let the actors take things to BIG emotional plateaus. It should be noted that Mother does go into some melodramatic beats, sometimes very heavily, but it's never at a cheap shot or angle. Mother is a harrowing film that treats its characters seriously, but also gives time here and there to observe how awfully bizarre some of it is. It's one of the best of the year.", "In a province in Pusan, South Korea, the slow Yoon Do joon (Bin Won) is a young man overprotected by his mother (Hye ja Kim) that works with acupuncture and herbs and does not like his worthless and reckless friend Jin tae (Goo Jin). When a Mercedes runs over Do joon, Jin tae follows the hit and run driver with Do joon and find the car parked in a golf club. Jin tae breaks the side mirror of the car and Do joon collects golf balls lost in a lake. When they see the cart with the driver and passengers of the Mercedes, there is a fight and they end in the police station. During the night, Do joon walks to the bar Manhattan to meet Jin tae that does not arrive; when Do joon returns home, he sees the easy Moon Ah jung (Mun hee Na) walking alone in an alley and entering in an abandoned house. On the next morning, Ah jung is found dead on the terrace of the house. The incompetent detectives find a golf ball near her body and they conclude that Do joon is the killer. Doo  joon is arrested; signs a confession and is charged of murder. However, his mother follows her instincts believing that her son is innocent and the scapegoat of the incompetent police department and seeks the truth disclosing a dreadful reality.Madeo is an original and dramatic South Korean thriller that has an engaging story with a surprising plot point and many twists. The director Joon ho Bong of Gwoemul makes a simple but effective film with a credible story of a single woman that does everything possible and impossible to prove the innocence of her son that is slow probably because he was poisoned when he was five. The performance of Hye ja Kim deserves a nomination to the Oscar in the role of a dedicated loving mother that pursues the truth about the murder of a teenager student. With the exception of one review of a user that probably has difficulties to read subtitles; the nine wins, six nominations and the favorable reviews of twenty three IMDb users are practically an unanimous indication that Madeo is a great film indeed. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Mother   A Busca Pela Verdade (Mother \u2013 Seeking the Truth)", "Was looking forward to this film after enjoying the director's earlier films, Memories of murder, The host n Snowpiercer.\nThe film is about a mentally challenged kid who is also being overprotected by his single mother who is a specialist in herbs n acupuncture.\nThe kid is arrested n charged with the murder of a young girl but the mother believes he is innocent n she goes out to prove his innocence.\nThe best part about this film is the acting by the lady who played the mother.\nAnother good aspect is the details.\nWhen the dead body of the girl is kept on the terrace of a dilapidated house for the whole town to see, we as viewers really wants to know the reason n the reason is explained towards the end well suiting.\nThe direction n cinematography were brilliant. The only problem was the editing. Found it to be a bit slow n long.", "Bong manages to capture some of the poignancy of motherhood in his film Mother, which concerns an elderly single mother (played by Hye ja Kim) and her son Yoon Do joon (played by Bin Won). Do joon is mentally disabled, he has a low intelligence and seems to have problems with his memory. His mother is absolutely devoted to her son. Bong throws light on that extraordinary capacity of some women to totally subjugate their own lives to those of their children, who live for the pep that they get seeing often unappreciative family members troughing their way through their latest offering.Do joon is framed up fairly early on by the police for a murder that they can't really be bothered to investigate thoroughly. So mum is on the case, you'd better believe it! This involves for example bringing in drinks for all the members of the detective bureau on a visit to the precinct. There's a lot of tragedy in the movie, but it's offset by a comedy that is at times is almost outrageous in it's manipulativeness, Bong's really being directly provocative at times (though not in a salacious sense)! There's a grand surreal scene at one point where he convinces you that a very minor character is going to perform a deeply uncanny suicide, and then something totally banal happens instead. One of my favourite scenes is a scene on a golf course where a shot dollys across to some action taking place in sugar white bunkers, which would not be out of place in a Fellini movie.Bong was playing with my emotions throughout, he set up affiliations between me and other characters only to subvert them or rebuild them later, he builds scenes to emotional explosiveness just for the sake of it. The film leaves you emotionally confused at times, Bong's smashing all the buttons on the telephone, and so you don't really know what number is being dialled. The effect is deliberate.Bottom line I think it's a celebration of motherhood, but it's not sugar coated, it's really warts and all.

Although we don't know resurrected victims are real or not, the movie is highly enjoyable. It's based on the murder of a prosecutor's mother. As the film goes, they show how the murder happened. So, it gets interesting more and more.The plot is like wrapped in a mystery. It's a simple murder case, but it's kind of complex inside which gives you some excitements. It's one of those movies of simple plot but a great one. Everything is good, including the performances of actors and actresses, except that actress who played as prosecutor's sister. Her acting was like she was a crazy girl. In a scene where she was afraid, her acting didn't seem that she was afraid. More like she was crazed. So, her acting was very bad.All in all, it shows a mother's love, even the children don't care that much about their mother. Regardless of it's fiction or not, the movie is great and enjoyable.", "RV: Resurrected Victims is a supernatural South Korean drama and thriller. It convinces with a creative story line, sinister atmosphere and intriguing characters. The film however suffers from being too melodramatic and lacking realism.The movie tells the story of a young prosecutor whose mother was killed in an armed robbery seven years ago. The prosecutor has become a bitter man who often recommends the death penalty instead of believing in redemption. One day, his sister calls him to tell that their deceased mother has come back home. The prosecutor hurries home in disbelief and gets attacked by his own mother. He learns that she is a resurrected victim that wants to avenge her own death. The prosecutor fails to understand why his mother attacked him in the first place. He starts digging in his own past in order to clear his name and give his mother peace of mind.On the positive side, the unusual story line is filled with unpredictable twists and turns that keep the movie interesting from start to finish. The characters also have certain depth as we learn more about the prosecutor's past and the mother's motivations. The film has an eerie and uneasy atmosphere between the mystery and horror genres even though the movie remains a supernatural crime investigation at heart.However, the movie has a somewhat dull pace in the middle section. The opening sequence is memorable and the conclusion is very emotional but everything in between has considerable lengths. The movie is also highly emotional and at times quite melodramatic. It attempts to be a tearjerker but goes a little bit overboard at times which can actually be observed in many Korean movies. The fact that the movie tries to connect human emotions with supernatural spirits sometimes seems like a contradiction. It's an unusual approach which makes it difficult to find an emotional connection to the story, especially since the mother turns out being not the only resurrected victim in the story.If you like supernatural dramas with surprising stoy lines, you should certainly watch this movie. If you don't like emotional movies with philosphical depth, you might find that film annoying. RV: Resurrected Victims has a quite unique style but attempts to accomplish too many things at once in my opinion. It was entertaining to watch but hard to digest. I don't regret watching it at all but wouldn't watch it again.", "Wow, a fantastic premise excellently executed.

However, watching Korean TV series has changed my perspective forever.This is my second IMDb comment since I started using IMDb many years ago. I am compelled to write about this series because it deserves to be noted, along side with another Korean TV series Dae Jang Geum (AKA A Jewel In The Palace) if you have not already seen it.If you have been an avid Korean romance TV drama fan before watching this series, you will probably find this one too clich\u00e9d and has taken (politely speaking) the best ingredients of other romantic themed TV dramas.However, if you are new to Korean romance TV dramas (dare I say anyone who has watched less than  Korean TV drama series prior to this?), then this will probably woo you as it did me, and forever change your view of Korean romantic TV dramas, for the same reason above: when you see other similar dramas after this, you will find bits and pieces of the others that remind you of this one. But    most importantly    this one has managed to weave it together better than all the others of the same genre to date. Is it any surprise that the writers and producers have benefited from previous similar productions? Would it be better off if this show was never produced?This brings me to the next point: I ask that anyone casting their vote to bear in mind that just because elements of this show came from others before it should not be the main reason for down casting it. Should we down grade an ice skater's superior performance just because he she has used similar steps as others before them? I think the difference is mainly in execution. This one is beautifully executed with some of the most memorable sound tracks for a romance based TV series ever    look up the song title Bo Go Ship Da on www.YouTube.com for a taste of what may have already become a classic    seems that every Korean I meet knows this song. The only other Korean TV romance drama series that has this memorable a sound track would be Winter Sonata, but this show still manages to out do it with it's own classic.I have heard many times from other people that watched this series BEFORE some of the other series telling me that nothing compares to this one    that they are spoiled by this show. I concur. If you watch this series, it may just have the same effect on you. Luckily, even though I watched Dae Jang Geum after this, DJG was not similarly themed that I was not disappointed at DJG in any way.Does this mean this show is PERFECT? No    hence the  out of . The acting by the stepmother and her daughter were over the top at times, and it did get a bit slower near the end where the emotions ran very high, but I strongly disagree with those that said the ending was bad because it is sad. I think the way it ended was beautifully done that though it was sad it wasn't poorly framed nor felt unpolished like some other dramas where the ending leaves you wondering if the writer fell asleep.So be forewarned    watch this show and it just may change your expectation for other romantic TV series that follow forever, not to mention needing a box of tissue handy for each episode.If you want to learn more about the show (and therein possible spoilers), visit http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Stairway_to_Heaven_(TV_series) by cutting and pasting the address into your browser.Side comment: This series has been watched at least three times in our household.

A must see.The story seems pretty straightforward and quite easy to get into. A cross between Cinderella and she's the man. The synopsis tells the story.But this is not a Hollywood made show.It goes much deeper than that. Where this show truly excels is portraying the relationships of the different characters in the show. Maybe its my Asian background. But the way they portray it and decisions made comes so close to my own experiences that its downright scary and also very touching.I guess it explains the huge success of the show...who ever watched this. They will see a parallel to their own situation. From a difficult relationship between a father and a son, to a mother trying to balance her need to find a new partner and her duty towards her daughters.To me it was the start of the boyfriend girlfriend relationship between EunChan and KanKyul. It mirrors my own experience so closely. The calling game, the little games you play with each other that could lead to misunderstandings and fights. And all this because you are afraid of the strong feelings you have for another person. Not knowing how to express it or how the other person feels about you.

Choi Han Kyul is the heir of a big food company, but his grandmother wants him to settle down, so she arranged many dates for him. After Eun Chan bumped into Han Kyul and was mistaken for a boy, Han Kyul decided to hire Eun Chan to be his gay lover in order to avoid the arranged dates. Desperately in need of money, Eun Chan had no choice but to accept. Han Kyul's grandmother also made Han Kyul in charge of a filthy coffee shop in danger of being bankrupt. Eun Chan begged to work at the coffee shop, and not long after, feelings start to spark, except, how would Han Kyul accept his homosexuality?It took me a while to get into this drama as I felt that it dragged in its early episodes. But as I went through viewing it, there is no doubt that this is a CLASSIC DRAMA. The First Shop of the Coffee Prince provides refreshing themes about homosexuality, self sacrifice, hard work,dreams,ambition,success,emotional and psychological issues that one may face in life. The story is one of a kind and not your typical Asian drama.Yoon Eun Hye,playing the tomboyish Eun Chan, played her role extremely well. Her chemistry with Goong Yoo, who played the confused Choi Han Kyul,is commendable too. Their chemistry was excellent. Both deserved their MBC acting awards for their work in this drama. The supporting cast is commendable as well. Aside from that, the soundtrack was magnificent. A must see Korean drama!!!!!!", "Let's start off with the weirdest thing. I'm Dutch, have no relationship with anything or anyone Korean, I just like Anime and J Pop K pop. While browsing through Netflix I came upon this gem. When I started first watching this show, about a week ago, I thought fudge it. I never saw a Korean TV series before with real actors, apart from the occasional Korean movie involving lots of fighting. Coffee Prince was my first encounter with a Korean TV series and boy, what a treat this is!As other reviewers have explained, this is all about the girl  needs job, pretends to be boy, falls for boss. The amazing thing about it is that these actors actually take you along their fantastic ride. At no point in this series I felt they were over acting. Every single actor is able to portray his character well and they truly develop throughout the series. This is no As The World Turns. ATWT doesn't even come close. This is real drama. You really feel with these actors, I even forgot they are actors at times! The episodes also take their time, running for an hour or longer which gives the actors and director time to really dig deep into their characters and situations. Characters develop during an episode and even more so over the course of the series.The struggle between the two main characters is a back and forth, a push and pull. Sometimes a tad annoying because you really want them to work things out and get together. But the things happening to them and in their relationship often provide roadblocks which must be overcome for them to go forward. The ways they deal with those roadblocks are recognizable for a normal human being. Nobody get's shot because they cheated. This is real drama.This series is totally captivating and had me interested until the last second. I only wish they would've made an episode about the marriage of the main characters too (and yes, I'm a man saying that...). It would've been the ultimate ending to the series if you ask me.", "The Coffee Prince shows love can cross boundaries (gender, economic status) and triumph. The love story is beautifully portrayed and makes Coffee Prince worth watching.The two leads embody the main characters perfectly. Gong Yoo plays Choi Han gyul, a rich aimless man and Yoon Eun hye plays Go Eun chan, a hard  working breadwinner for her family. Eun chan does not look or dress in a feminine fashion and Han gyul mistakes her for a boy. Their initial relationship is based on Han gyul paying Eun chan to act as his boyfriend to repulse the blind dates his Grandmother and Mother set him up with, as they want him to settle down and marry. Han gyul then is challenged to make a decrepit coffee shop profitable in  months (as co owner) and Eun chan gets a job in the coffee shop. It is wonderful to watch their ensuing friendship and love blossom. Han gyul struggles with his love for Eun chan as it challenges his concepts that love should only between a man  and a woman. The lead actor, Gong Yoo, goes all in on his character, Han gyul, playing crucial moments with intensity and elevating the entire drama. The lead actress, Yoon Eun hye, manages to be sympathetic as her character Eun chan continues her gender lie longer than necessary. The supporting characters of the drama did not grab me so their on  screen stories were not of much interest, lowering the overall of the effect of Coffee Prince as a whole. *SPOILER* When Han gyul finally allows himself to love Eun chan regardless of gender (episode ) it is the best moment of the drama and truly touching. *SPOILER* The finale episode is the weakest as we wait too long for the couple to be reunited, but all ends well.", "OK. I watched this show for the first time in . I was . I had just been whipped into phase of watching Korean Dramas by one of my good friends. Compared to the first Korean show I watched, which I also loved but for other reasons (Boys Over Flowers), this show seemed so much more genuine. (I have not included spoilers about events but I might have included spoilers about different character's characteristics. If that makes any sense.)First of all, the relationships weren't outlandish. There is no extreme hate between any of the characters in the show. No arch nemesis. The parents grand parents are more reasonable when it comes to the romance of the main characters than any other K drama I have seen thus far. The supporting relationship in the show is a refreshing, long lasting love between reasonable, authentic adult characters, which, understandably has some hiccups along the way. Second, the characters weren't to the extremes. I have seen so many dramas with bratty chaebol sons who wear expensive clothing and drive fast cars. Han Kyul is rich and spoiled, but his wealth is toned down so that he is a believable character. Eun Chan was believable too. She didn't beat up people twice her size and the actor wasn't fighting too hard to pass as male. She seemed natural and cool. Sure there are some wacky characters in this show, Mr. Hong, Ha Rim, Sun Ki and Min Yeob, but none of them do extremely garish things which ruin the mood of the show. Third, Gong Yoo is just great, isn't he? He is a very handsome individual and I quite like the ensemble of different facial expressions that he can pull (my favorite is the raised eyebrows). Plus, he still looks great ten years later!Fourth, Yun Eun Hye is terrific as this  year old tomboy. Her chemistry with Gong Yoo has not been surpassed by anyone in any other the other shows or movies I have seen him in. I must admit, after watching this, I haven't been able to bring myself to watch any other shows that she is in. I see her as such a boy, and without the short hair and masculine tendencies, her performance in other shows and movies always leaves me feeling a bit empty.The plot kept me on the edge of my seat right up until the end. I'm only docking one point. Half a point because the ending is lacking some, and even though I've watched the show through a few times, I'm always hoping there is something extra that I missed at the end. Plus another half a point for the scenes which I feel are unnecessary and cumbersome to the plot, like Sun Ki's story (sorry Sun Ki)."], "Sentiment Score": 0.6383333333333333}, "1143": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1169": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["The film starts off with the suicidal main character being interrogated by the police. Right away we know this isn't going to be an active story but a passive one that is revealed through the telling of various stories. This kind of technique isn't that uncommon and it can result in effective engagement, but that didn't happen here. As the man tells his story, the homeless woman is introduced. She in turn, within the story that the man is telling, has to tell her story so we understand who she is and why she's in his story. Her story introduces us to another character who has to have a story and the net effect of this is that the film never gets out of background mode until the very end where the clich\u00e9 of love that arrives after death has intervened to make it impossible, attempts to tickle our heartstrings and make us forget we really don't care.Kang Hye jeong is a wonderful actress and is almost able to make something of her character but she isn't given enough raw material to get completely there. This film relies on background stories for its grill so she is required to be a twenty something hobo for most of the film and then a high school kid for some of the background.

This piece of garbage ranks safely among the bottom .A highschool guy changes his fashion sense and becomes more popular, but becomes a target by bullies. This movie feels like it was made for teenage girls who like to watch guys strut around, doing nothing interesting whatsoever. The humor is incompetent and the characters are wafer thin. The bully subplot is a dumb scriptwriting decision that clashes horribly with the rest of the movie; it feels like a desperate attempt to add fake depth. The fashion elements are embarrassing and not the least bit engaging. This is so devoid of content that it quickly becomes annoying, and it's frankly almost impossible to sit through.South Korea, along with Japan, has developed an outstanding pedigree for films concerning teenagers and or children. Just in the past handful of years they have delivered A Brand New Life (), Thread of Lies (), Bleak Night (), Han Gong ju (), Duresori: The Voice of East (), Silenced (), Pluto (), and Sunny () \u2013 just to name a few. They have also made some fairly recent teenage comedies that were really good. I have greatly enjoyed some of their more light hearted films.With that said, Fashion King () is a pile of elephant manure. There's zero charm, zero laughs, and the serious elements are offensively bad.", "I am posting a review for this film, both because it was a lot of fun to watch and because I don't think it deserves to be represented solely by a one star review. I, myself, have only seen around  Korean movies but could easily name  of them that are MUCH worse than this one. I am assuming that the previous reviewer was objecting more to the style and content of the movie rather than the quality. Why namedrop heavy critically acclaimed dramas in a review for a lighthearted teen comedy about high school fashion. Because that is what this movie is. And that is all it is trying to be. It's obviously not shooting for a Grand Bell.The movie follows sad sack nerd Woo Ki myung who is so badly bullied that his mother moves him to Seoul to get away from his daily torment. Entering a high school where fashion is highly important, Ki myung (with the help of an outrageous best friend and an underground fashion designer who is selling knock off brand names on the web) reinvents himself as one of the trendy kids and is successful enough to come under fire from the school's fashion king. Their conflict, while moving the story forward, is not the heart of the movie as this is really a film about what makes a person truly stand out from the crowd. Do the clothes make the man or the man make the clothes.This movie has some very familiar teen tropes  nerd becomes cool becomes nerd, ugly duckling smart girl becomes beautiful swan, etc. But this film presents them in a fun, kinetic and unique way so they don't seem tired or re tread. Won Joo is quite good as the tormented teen who still has a quiet self assurance about him, even as he is being humiliated. Seong oh Kim is fantastic as the hungry fashion designer turned mentor. I quite enjoyed this film and found it, not only funny, but charming. It doesn't take itself too seriously and is intentionally goofy at times but that only adds to the fun of it. Plus, I hear all the dope kids like it.", "Why watch this film? For the actors, I guess. Or, if you are not in a mood for something too heavy. Though this one does get a little boring. Another problem was that the film focuses on representing the webtoon dynamics, trying to present that manga feeling as good as possible, which, unfortunately, results to make the film look cheep and kind of a TV movie.

Then you will be rewarded with feisty girls, pretty boy actors (flower boys), excellent cinematography, catchy music scores and sweeping stories like Moon Lovers.The plot: During a total eclipse of the sun, a  year old st century woman, Go Ha jin (Lee Ji Eun), is transported back in time to Goryeo Dynasty. She wakes up in the year , in the body of  year old Hae Soo and there, she encounters the many royal princes of the ruling family. She initially falls in love with the gentle and warm th Prince Wang Wook (Kang Ha Neul), and later with Wang So (Lee Joon Gi), the mutilated th Prince who hides his scarred face behind a mask. He's surnamed wolf dog, because he had to fight wolves when he was still young and was treated badly as a hostage. Now he likes to foster his image as a fearsome beast. There's a fight for the throne going on. Hae Soo finds herself caught between it all. Thanks to her history lessons at school she comes to realize Wang So will win this battle finally. He'll become the future king of Goryeo, and a bloody tyrant at that. Soo loves So, but she also fears him. Can she change her lover into a better ruler in time? The Good: The first meeting of the 'Moon Lovers', Hae Soo and Wang So, sets the tone for the whole series: old fashioned romance but a love that hurts. There's the black Wolf Prince riding his war horse, first endangering Hae Soo but saving her as well by lifting her in the saddle in front of him. Then there's the extended closeup of their faces, sitting opposite each other, bouncing up and down, having their eyes on each other while the music plays their love theme. The next scene he seems afraid of his own feelings and So drops Soo to the ground. Their love is painful, literally.Leading man Lee Joon Gi is simply the best actor available for that kind of TV making. The minute he appears on the screen I am glued to his face and facial expressions despite his mask, that renders all kinds of emotions like joy, pain, embarrassment, hate. Notwithstanding his well performed fighting scenes, he's in danger of becoming a modern Rudolph Valentino, with female fans only. I hope he'll get the chance to proof himself in less romantic roles playing more tormented characters like the lead in Man on High Heels ()for example.The Bad: Moon Lovers is a remake of the Chinese series 'Scarlet Heart' with  episodes. The original version could handle all the princes and their love interests. The Korean production however should have cut some story lines to flesh out the characters of Soo and So, who are the protagonists, giving them more time to develop their romance. Now we were misled thinking Wang Wook was Soo's Prince Charming. Kang Ha Neul gives a stunning performance, so it was no punishment to watch him stealing screen time from Lee Joon Gi. But the story lines became too difficult to tell, leaving plot holes until the very end. Also there are still questions unanswered: is this all about(moon)love? Or altering history?

Scarlet Heart Ryeo has just begun airing in the Philippines but I have access to the original version with English subtitle, which I prefer.

It's basically a musically themed melodrama about some young people.SPOILERS AHEAD!The story centers on the prestigious Kirin Arts Academy; a school devoted entirely to taking young talented performers and turning them into future star musicians, dancers, singers, etc. It's not easy getting into this school, but if you do, you'll be trained night and day to realize your potential.Enter our young aspiring artists. They come from differing backgrounds with varying experience and talents. They all try out to be accepted by the school; some make the cut and some don't for various reasons. One girl that fails to get accepted is given a chance to earn a special exception if she can bring in a couple of other students one of the teachers wants to train. Everybody soon converges together, and the story quickly focuses on the  young primary characters;  girls and  boys, some of which have made the cut, and some of which are trying to get in through the back door.The characters are forced to get to know each other, and have to work together to accomplish their goals (or work against each other as is sometimes the case). Some grow in life over time as individuals, others fall prey to the emotional pitfalls of success and failure. Along the way, some friendships are born and others are crushed, romantic interests are explored, and so forth. This is all very typical stuff for this type of genre, and, it's done competently enough to be a solid melodrama all on its own. All this is set against the backdrop of their individual talents & the arts school though, and, that is where the show really shines.Prior to watching this show, I already was aware that the  lead characters were actually fairly accomplished young musicians, dancers, and or singers, in real life. There's a number of musical set pieces and performances throughout the show, and the  leads had no problem delivering the goods in that aspect when called upon. Actually, I was much more concerned if these people could really act, than I was worried they'd be able to pull off the musical numbers. Amazingly, they're all more than acceptable actors and actresses in their specific roles, and some of them gave quite good performances in regards. Overall: Fantastic Job Everyone!I wouldn't actually classify this show as a musical; there are only but a few song & dance numbers (if that many) that spontaneously break out. Almost all of the musical performances are done within the context of story (i.e. during practice, stage events, try outs, scheduled performances, etc). There's also only a handful of instances of one of the cast members singing to another one, but that's about it. The way the musical performances are incorporated makes for real nice blend to the overall story. Neither part of these differing show aspects interferes with, or outweighs, the other; this is an important part in making this show work successfully as a whole, and, it was all handled with a good deal of aplomb throughout.There's a number of other secondary characters and story lines during this show's  episode run. Other artists come and go as guest stars, the school and teachers are focused on some, people's lives and families are looked at, etc. It's mostly all serviceably to effectively accomplished.What could be improved here?...not much (if anything). Asking to tone down the melodrama a bit is just not going to happen with these KTV shows, so deal with it. I suppose the production company could spring for some space heaters for everybody on the set of a winter time KTV show in order to keep their young stars from freezing to death.Bottom Line: This show is definitely geared towards a younger audience than I, but that didn't stop me from liking it anyway, and, I liked it a lot actually. It's enjoyable, and, it is quite good overall. The cast and crew of Dream High II has certainly got their work cut out for them if they want to be on par with this show. out of  stars!...Well Recommended!", "I loved this K drama about high school kids pursuing their artistic dreams, and I'm a  year old woman!

I am so glad I got to enjoy it before it was taken off! You can still see it on the DramaFever website but it's not as much fun when watching on a computer instead of a  inch HDTV   plus unless you pay monthly on that site to take the ads off you are interrupted with them on DramaFever every ten minutes.

Thus all this in a bunch makes this dorama really exciting. Honestly, I see this 'sitcom'  dorama as the best in the line of all the musical series, I've seen in my life (I'm nearly , thus I have some experience in it :)) THE STORY: It's a story about  students of Kirin High School of Art in Seul   the school for pop talents   dancers, singers, composers. It starts from showing a girl (Go Hye Mi) singing opera on a stage. Next, we see shy girl (Yoon Baek Hee), acting like a Hye Mi's fan. She's Hye Mi's admirer and friend. Later it appears, Hye Mi's father went bankrupt and run away of the country, owing some money to mafia. Mafia tries to get the money from Hye Mi and this brings her from the way of opera singer to the Kirin school. Next we see Hye Mi's teachers (Kang Oh Hyuk, Shi Kyung Jin). Also we see future Hye Mi's friends   violent Jin Gook, country man Song Sam Dong, cool dancer Jason and strange person in a sushi costume (Kim Pil Sook). Hye Mi and Baek Hee will try to pass the entrance exams to Kirin school. Hye Mi will fail, but the school principal will open a special class for the students (and a teacher), who, by his opinion, worth something. Thus it is just the beginning of the story.Try to get it and see by your own eyes :)", "Dream High is a captivating musical drama that focused a group of young students of Kirin High School and their passionate journey through music to fulfill their dreams overcoming all the haphazard of life under the guidance of some motivating teachers. And the drama was simply moving and touching in many senses with fantastic music score. Some plot holes can be overlooked being mesmerized by the realistic plot line and natural acting. From the third episode, I really got into the drama and it was overall so interesting and heart warming. Tough but emotional character Go Hye Mi (the then newbie actress Suzy Bae quietly succeeded in turning out the main character, she's an awesome singer too), her follower friend Yoon Baek Hee, fatty but cutely Kim Pil Suk (IU) (both of their transformation are quite interesting),helpful and caring guy Jin Guk (Taecyeon was so lovely and matured in that role), music prodigy country boy Song Sam Dong ( cool alien Do Min Joon of My Love from the Star was a way too crazy!), , handsome Jason, inspirational guide   teacher Kang and also the other supporting characters were touching at least for some moments .

We can be in ease in handling difficult situations just by smiling at fears. A good teacher is like a light house. In ups and downs of life, family and friend support can turn out to be a great relief. And after taking a decision, don't regret over it, you've a chance to prove it the best!  these inner morals of this drama are easy to say, tough to implement in real life but obviously these have made the drama ultimately inspirational , moving and memorable . Just to mention, I watched the impressive first season only and don't have any wish to watch the second season with totally different cast. :)", "I am not used to watch Asian dramas, I'm from Brazil and all I'm used are the TV shows from my country and some from Europe and the USA.But I got curious to check a little more about a foreign country from the other side of the world.When I first read some thoughts about this show I was expecting a story about six teenagers going into some trouble to get into an art school. But it goes far far away from that, in the very beginning I got a little upset about how things were taking place...But in the middle things started to be clearer and I can say for sure it is not only about six young dreams coming true, but it is the path they follow with the help of their family, friends and teachers.Yes, for me, the main plot of this TV show were the teachers, the students starts to follow what they believe and things happens not as we like in the middle, but as soon as it gets to the end you start to realize the values involved in everything.I am fascinated about what I just watched, I never wrote a review before because nothing has really touched me like I felt right now when I saw the ending.It is millions of time worth it to watch, you will see some of the Korean society cultures involved, you'll see some dreams coming true, others getting lost in their way, and most important, you'll see people rebuilding their path because they believe it is possible to dream and pursuit the happiness thru the realization of their dream.And I have to confess, everything is sooooo different from what I was used to, like if I'm not wrong, you'll see only four kisses, a very nice ones, very subtle and very beautiful... and you'll see a lot of crying and tears (like those I have right now)... and this is something I don't understand, why so many tears? This is something I don't see in dramas around here, but it might has a strong meaning for Koreans, because it is probably in every single episode.Once again, if you want to get touched, if you want to understand values of life, and of course, if you love music, you have to watch this, I promise, if you're a human being, it will touch you somehow.Enjoy and my best wishes for those who made this drama available."], "Sentiment Score": 0.6}, "1445": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1056": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1289": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "984": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1312": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["The previous reviewer dwelled on the penis thing and the erotic aspect of this film, but I think he, along with many others, missed the point. It's partly the fault of the advertising campaign, which I understand emphasized Jo YeoJung's (as well as other actors') nude scenes    but I don't know how anyone can still retain the impression that this movie is an erotic bodice ripper after actually watching it. This is a dark, perilous journey through the obsessions and grudges of people who cannot stop running lest they fall behind, and the sweat is all of the cold kind.The said scenes involving nudity and sexuality are not in the least erotic, nor did I find Kim DongWook's reaction to the coitus by the book(literally) as the hapless young king at all comedic, intentionally or otherwise; rather he did a fine job of assaying a pathetic and desperate character trapped in an intolerable situation, and his mental near collapse was almost palpable. And the supporting characters' stories did not interfere with the unfolding of the main plot for me    they were not subplots so much as back stories for the characters' motivations, and served to flesh out, not complicate, the plot.Aside from the mostly fine direction and the acting    which latter ranged from decent (in a few cases) to very good (mostly)    for me the art direction and cinematography were particular standouts. While most historical epics tend to emphasize sumptuous costumes and the splendor of the architecture and ornamentation, this movie did the opposite; while it is visually rich in its own, gloom laden way, everything in it is in dark, muted colors as if it were dyed with tea, the ladies wear little jewelry and the sets are kept very lean, to sometimes very striking, almost expressionistic, effect, as when HwaYeon's maid is assigned new, better quarters of her own after catching the King's eye, but the room is entirely empty, and the woman is shown laughing in semi hysterical self congratulation on a tiny mat on an otherwise bare floor.There are many, many scenes shot at very close range, often lit by simulated candlelight at night, creating an overall claustrophobic feel that visually replicates the suffocating atmosphere of the intrigue riddled court these people endured. Fittingly, the scenes of violence are presented suddenly and starkly, with minimal cues in the soundtrack, which makes them all the more shocking yet realistic.While not exactly a masterpiece, this movie is a well thought out and well executed production, much superior to the kind of titillating fluff it is made out to be by some. It definitely deserves a thoughtful watch.", "Unlike the recent South Korean period dramas, the movie has a notable anachronistic feeling. It seems its background is the Joseon dynasty( ) considering the design of architectures in the film, but there is also the influences from the Goryeo dynasty( ) in the characters' costumes and other details. They behave like the people living during the Joseon dynasty, but, as far as I know, there was not any incident during that period which can possibly inspire the lurid story of the film, and I have never heard about the king's mother presiding over the copulation ritual of her son and daughter in law in the next room.But, despite its fictional world, the ruthless pursuit of power in the palace is a familiar story you have encountered in other stories. The king is dead due to an unidentified cause, and the king's mother(Park Ji yeong), who is actually his stepmother, now holds the power to decide who will be the next king. She quickly puts her own son, Prince Seong  won(Kim Dong wuk), on the throne, and she also swiftly eliminates her opponents including the previous king's father in law.In such a circumstance like that, the previous king's wife, Hwa yeon(Cho Yeo jeong), naturally has lots of worry about not only her future and but also her young son's future. He is just a child at present, but this innocent kid is already deemed as a potential threat to the kingship, and he can be killed at any time if the king's mother and her followers have a chance to get a good reason for that. Some of South Korean audiences have never heard of Lady MacBeth or Richard III, but they will be reminded of several bloody incidents during the Joseon dynasty or other dynasties preceding that. King Danjong of the Joseon dynasty was dethroned by his uncle, who became the next king, and then this young boy was killed later when he was thought to be too much of trouble(believe or not, it was said that this horrific decision was strongly supported by his great uncle). In case of Prince Young Chang, he was murdered by King Gwanghaegun of the Joseon dynasty just because he was a more legitimate heir to the throne than the king himself. Anything could be committed for absolute power in those days, you know.Unlike his ruthless mother, Prince Seong won has other thoughts about his sister in law, and we know why. While he was merely a prince, he met her in her father's house, and he has been obsessed with her since then. His mother already sets him up with the other woman as his queen when he becomes the king, but he still wants Hwa yeon in spite of his mother's warning. It may be not that bad to sleep with the deceased brother's wife(well, he is the king, isn't he?), but it can be fatal to sleep with someone who can threaten the power.The situation becomes more complicated after another player of this dangerous game of palace intrigue appears in the palace. His name is Kwon yoo(Kim Dong wuk), who was Hwa yeon's former lover in the past. When he tried to elope with Hwa yeon before she was sent to the place as the previous king's new wife, he was captured and castrated by Hwa  yeon's father, and now he enters the palace as one of new eunuchs. While he is quickly promoted enough to be near the king, he becomes also a little closer to Hwa yeon though he lacks a certain body part crucial for rekindling their feelings in the past. Can she trust him as a close ally? And does she really have some feelings for him as he guesses?You never can be sure about them because of the understated but competent performances by Jo Yeo jeong and Kim Min joon. Revealing real feelings in the palace can be a fatal blow to your fate, and they must hide their emotions and thoughts as much as possible to survive. Jo Yeo  jeong is good as a woman who gradually becomes as ruthless and cunning as her enemies through her need to survive. When she comes to know that the king wants her, she see it as an opportunity to win the game, and she is determined to manipulate him to turn against her devious mother  in law.Meanwhile, clueless and reckless Guem OK(Cho Eun ji), a maid who has served for Hwa yeon, finds herself in a serious situation way over her head. She is forced to copulate with the king when he is very frustrated over his desire toward Hwa yeon, and we can say that she is virtually raped, but, what do you know, she feels a lot better to see her changed position as one of the king's concubines. Unfortunately, while intoxicated with her newly gained power, she does not have the slightest idea about how dangerous the power game can be between the women in the palace.The king's mother is the most powerful and dangerous player in this perilous game, and Park Ji young gives a juicy villainous performance which ably supplies grand gestures whenever they are required. The king's mother has probably done many terrible things for protecting his son and making the throne ready for him, but it is not easy for her to resist the power behind the throne \u2013 and now her dear son is becoming one of the major blocks in her grand plan.", "The problem with this movie is that it goes in a complex and jumbled direction and some parts of it lead to hardly anything all that effective. The cinematography and acting is good and some parts are just cruel which leaves a bit of a impression on how things worked during the Joseon Dynasty. When it comes to males their manhood means just about everything to them(well for most men at least) and their pride comes from the length of it all. Even when they compete it comes down to their ego which is basically a penis measuring competition. The plot contrived of something more than what it is. And when it comes down to it the moral of this movie is to never mess with a man's penis or you will face the consequences. As comedic as that sounds that is basically the message of this movie although everything is a bit jumbled. Besides the penis aspect of it all it sort of reminded me of the  Korean movie The Servant which Jo Yeo Jeong who is the lead actress in this was part of. Because both movies are erotic and sexual while dealing with the distance a man would go for their love or the person they lust over. While also dealing with a person that is constantly getting in the way of if all. So the plot in this is basically about a woman that tries to save his lover's life when they decided to run away together and get caught. And thus she volunteers to become a concubine for the king in order to save her lover's life. But soon a bunch of conspiracies happen in the palace when the king passes away and the prince is in love well in lust over the concubine way before she became a concubine and finds her in the palace before the king's death. And during the conspiracy the queen who is very cruel and cold gets involved as well. And there is constant arguing and conflict between the selfish prince and the tyrant queen because of the concubine. And later the concubine finds her previous lover but is shocked to know he has become a eunuch. So yeah this movie is quite a plot but besides few slightly shocking and erotic scenes nothing really makes this movie stand out. After the movie is finished nothing much about is memorable and the plot just doesn't stick. The plot isn't bad, in fact some parts of it is actually quite well written but there really isn't anything special about it and is unfocused as times. When it comes down to the core of it all besides the whole penis thing, is that just about all the characters in this act for their own self interest...I guess somethings never change. I give this movie a  because the climax slightly upgraded this movie.

While this is a part of the film it is only a small part of a much larger drama that has much more to do with mothers.The title is a bit confusing and I can only assume that it was named such due to a Spilling the Beans moment in the film. There is sex but not in the volumes that one might expect by the title.The acting was quite well and I could really feel the emotional energy from the female characters coming through. It was filmed well but the scripting was convoluted in places and could've been delivered just as well with a few things omitted.Overall, I enjoyed the film. I liked our female characters and the obsessive nature, be it fueled by jealousy, lust or revenge, of the males.

I'm sure I watched all of it (which I recall being somewhat of a masochistic endeavor), and this was only  years ago or so, but it obviously did not leave a very indelible impression on me for whatever reason. To be fair, I should probably watch it again before writing a review, but, there's just no way in hell I'm going to sit through  episodes again for something I've already seen that didn't stick with me the first time around. The main problem with this show should be obvious, i.e. it's just too freaking long. A fifty episode series is a bit cumbersome in this day and age of televised Korean melodramas. I don't have ADHD or anything, but this particular genre is just generally not suited to be stretched out for such a long period of time. I think the sweet spot for these K drama shows is in the   episode range (maybe a little more or less on occasion). Sometimes, lengthier shows can work well if done right, but they are much more the exception rather than the rule. As it stands,  episodes did not work very well at all here, and as such, this show is stuck in some kind of no man's land territory of being somewhat epic in length, but not epic enough in story to match its run time.Here's your basic story and outline of this show (which will perhaps be the worst and most lazily summary I've written on this site): Bae Doo na stars in the lead role as the soon to be named Gloria character. She's the poor girl working all kinds of odd jobs to help herself and her handicapped sister simply survive. Gloria eventually gets the chance to become a stage singer, but I can't quite remember how or why this exactly happens. She soon starts performing at a local club and also gets a contract job with some record label or something that's run by a rich handsome dude who takes a liking to her. Gloria and the young record company owner are the main leads, and I'm pretty sure they eventually fall in love, have their trials & tribulations along the way, then probably live happily ever. There are  other secondary leads as well: Gloria's poor childhood male friend, and some pretty rich girl who decides to slum it for whatever reason, and falls in love with the poor male friend. There are family problems & secrets, side characters with hidden agendas, some singing along the way, resolutions to various love angles, typical melodrama, etc. Eventually, the poor boy has to go on the run for some reason, and, somebody owns a chicken restaurant at some point that all the characters frequent, and, blah, blah, blah!This show is probably  to  times longer than it should be in order to be effective. As a result, it's often rather bland and moves along at a snail's pace. It's also chock full of stock story lines and stereotypical characters; I am sick and tired of these K drama shows rolling out the same  patriarchal characters over and over again (i.e. the poor worthless degenerate gambling scheming drunk vs. the rich entitled demanding snob who has to have things his way). If you based your real world view of Asian familial culture on the older male characters that frequently appear in these K dramas, you'd wonder why anyone in Asia would have any respect for their elders at all.I did not really hate this show. I'd say indifference, or ambivalence, is more of my overriding opinion of it. There are some bright spots here and there, and basic story would have been very workable in a shorter format. Acting is solid enough (aside from the annoying cookie cutter old dudes and the gangsters from central casting). All of the  young protagonists are mostly easy enough to root for, and everybody involved did what they were supposed to. The plot repeats itself endlessly though, and it all just ends up dragging on forever. There came a time that I just didn't couldn't care about this show anymore (somewhere about halfway through the show's run time). It eventually becomes more of a chore to keep following as it crawls along to completion, and, you'll almost certainly find yourself just going through the motions in order to finish watching it.I see this show is often summarized elsewhere using the buzz word intense (i.e. intense story, intense lives, etc). Frankly, that's laughable!...This series is no more intense, or set apart in any way, than any other standard K drama show from this era. Truthfully, it's all very status quo in nature, except that it's so long in run time that it ends up being little more than downright tedious & boring when all is said and done.Bottom Line: If you have a  some hour show with the terrific Bae Doona at your disposal, and nothing really ends up being memorable, then your show has some problems...namely, that its  some hours long!Unless you're a Doona filmography completest, don't bother watching this. Your time could be much better spent watching  other similar modern K drama shows which are much more economical, streamlined, and better, than this series is. out of  stars!P.S. This show is just WAY TOO LONG (in case I haven't made myself clear yet)!"], "Sentiment Score": 1.0}, "726": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["This is a great movie!!! I'm seeing some bad reviews about this movie on this site, but I think I know why (btw, I'm Korean). Among many Korean movies I've watched, I think this movie has a little more depth to it then some other Korean movies with simpler plots. This movie takes place in the southern region of South Korea, and about % of the dialogue is in southern dialect, meaning very unique and distinctive words expressions which are very hard to translate in English while carrying the full intended meaning. For example, one of the ending lines of the movie quotes, I will protect her until I paint the walls with my poop, in Korean (before translation) this is a very comical and meaningful line, but when translated in English as above, it sounds rather awkward than funny. In addition, there are parts in the movie which may seem very very strange and weird (or simply difficult to understand or find funny) to viewers who aren't Asian. Some parts of the movie may only be understandable to it's actually intended meaning if the viewer had lived in Asia(??) I have lived in Canada for over  years and can see the different perspectives of the Asian viewers and the other viewers on this movie. Anyways, I found this movie GREAT!!! and recommend it to any viewers looking to look (more) into Asian culture, or are willing to challenge themselves with trying to understand what the actors plot actually mean, other wise I recommend other Korean comedies such as my sassy girl or  days with Mr.Arrogant.

Any romantic comedy compared to My Sassy Girl would of course be not up to par.I give this a   or so. The story was actually not a bad one.

This definitely deserves better than a . though. I would say it have at least a . Everyone is complaining about Cha Tae hyun's character just screaming to be funny. Well, that is his character in the movie, that is his personality so I don't know why you would complain about it. Also, Son Ye jin's character is supposed to be a crier. If any of you had the slightest clue of why she did what she did then you would understand why she cried so much. Yun Dong geun did a great job as well. His character changed dramatically because he became better friends with Cha Tae hyun.People need to look deeper into a film than just judge the general film itself.

Although in the end, (since this was a Korean film), I already expect the smooth flow of drama that really makes me so fond watching Korean Films. It starts with a slight animation about two babies, Il Mae and Tae il. The two have been best friends ever since Tae il's mother breastfed Il Mae after her mother died. Her father bestows her to Tae Il, who first has to achieve certain conditions which include getting into university, passing the judicial exams and including the size of his... hahaha!!!Tae il was always been a trouble maker. That's probably the reason why Il mae's dad hesitate to allow him to be with his daughter. Il Mae's dad which is also Tae il's teacher has so many condition before he can be with his daughter. Because of that Tae il was challenge to change his stupid behavior and tries to be serious as he can be until the time that he accomplish his career.Il mae's character was so mysterious. On the first part of the movie, you'll notice that she really hates Tae il. Maybe because of his dense attitude. But deep inside she also feel affection for Tae il no matter who he is. Wherein you will become aware of at the last part.\nIl mae's mom died because of a certain disease. Since then she always comprehend and felt so sorry for her dad. She loves her dad so much. She always notice that her dad was in great sorrow about her mom. Unfortunately, she don't like to see Tae il the same way she sees on her dad. Because she inherited her mom's disease.The ending was so remarkable. It's my favorite part. It's similar to a fairy tale that will find a way to have a blissful ending.", "Yun Dong geun, a veteran actor (Who's Got the Tape, Marrying the Mafia), Cha Tae hyun (My Sassy Girl, Lover's Concerto), and the beautiful Son Ye jin (A Moment to Remember, Lover's Converto, The Classic) are not enough to turn the tables of this horrible movie. The story is plain Grade 'C' boring and resorts to male pubic hair anecdotes to capture our attention in the first  minutes of the movie. It failed.Seeing that Crazy First Love was produced in  made me feel more disgusted. There were far more better romance comedy Korean movies made before . Timeless classics such as 'My Sassy Girl' (), 'My Wife is a Gangster' (), 'Sex is Zero' (), 'Marrying the Mafia' () can easily topple Crazy First Love in terms of entertainment value and storyline. I thought 'Wet Dreams' () was done in bad taste, full of male organ and nonsense jokes. However Crazy First Love brought the definition of bad taste to a whole new level.There are better Korean movies to watch. Do not waste your life on this movie.Mao points:  ", "CRAZY FIRST LOVE () Directed by Oh Jong rok. Typically overblown tragicomedy that signifies much of what westerners find inaccessible about Korean cinema and, to some extent, the Korean psyche. Let's call this lecture Misogyny and the Posessive, Overgrown Man Child. To protect the virtue of his daughter (Son Ye jin), an authoritarian high school teacher (Yoo Dong geun) sets   and keeps changing   unreasonable standards for the young slacker (MY SASSY GIRL's Cha Tae hyn) who has loved her since childhood, then must work WITH him when she grows tired of their constant meddling and surveillance and becomes involved with another man. Korean men do not come off particularly well in this film (but then,that would depend on who you asked). They're either shallow gadflies or control freaks with maturity issues. How fitting, then, that the only way the male filmmakers could rationalize their crazed behaviour in the greater social theme of things is to slap the progressive minded female lead with myelodysplastic syndrome, the same terminal disease   read punishment   that killed her mother at . Faced with her own immortality, and in a scene far, FAR too reminiscent of MY SASSY GIRL, we FINALLY discover why she couldn't be with the man who has gone to insane lengths to win her affection and why she COULD be with a lothario who will one day find happiness with yet another woman.While it's tough to deny the calculation behind emotional scenes like those that end this film   and in Korean cinema scenes like these are legion   one can't shake the feeling that for Korean comedic cinema   indeed MUCH of Korean cinema in general   to truly move on and perhaps capture a larger international audience, Korean filmmakers may need to dispense with a great deal of the contrived, subtly misogynistic heart string manipulation that, ultimately, reinforces dated stereotypes about patriarchy, makes childish men look like pariahs and punishes women for thinking outside the box. People crying on mountaintops (and this film is has one!) are starting to wear thin. See also SEX IS ZERO for a similar treatment of these themes.

We see his blight as he struggles to survive and how he comes to terms with the reality of what's happening. There's a superb balance between him and the outside world who is attempting to rescue him, witnessing empathy, sympathy and later tragedy but also the lack of, from the media and politicians causing conflict about what's the right thing to do. It's touching, when seeing the lengths people will go to in offering help in a time of crisis, like the radio station for example, playing him messages of support each day. This show of humanity reminded me of the epic TV movie of the late eighties, Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure and the more recent World Trade Centre, only fundamental difference, this not being a true story. Sometimes I felt like being a passerby, watching the train wreck happen right before you, seeing things going from bad to worse without being able to lift a finger to do anything. But on the flip side it's purposefully comical to display another side of what it is to be human. There's incredible performances for the three key characters, especially Cloud Atlas star Doona Bae who plays his grieving wife having to deal with the press whilst trying to do as much as she possibly can to aid the rescue. And Dal su Oh is superb as the chief, who's in charge of the operation who has this moral obligation to save him. The film is loaded with tough decisions and moral issues questioning you, what would you do if you were either of the three characters. It did drag, but only ever so slightly for the min running time. Has got an amazing score from Young Jin Mok and the set pieces are on point with some amazing camera work. I wouldn't recommend this for viewers with fear of tunnels or claustrophobia but a great drama with some amazing performances, a must see for world cinema drama fans.

If you haven't seen A Hard Day yet, stop right now and go watch it...see what I mean? Well, Seong Hun Kim, the director of that one, has a new one: The Tunnel. And it's over the top crazy. And over the top good.A car dealer, Jung so, just closed a deal for a fleet of cars and it's his daughter's birthday and he's driving home with her cake and happily enters Hado Tunnel Number One (which apparently runs for about  miles through the most untraveled stretch of highway on the Korean peninsula) when the tunnel collapses. Always something, isn't it? And not just collapse: a friggin' apocalyptic cave in of not only the tunnel but half the mountain, leaving only a few feet of the far exit still open. Jung so's Kia sedan withstands a pummeling of rock and earth that would have flattened an Abrams tank (good cars, them Kias), living him dirty, bruised, intact, and trapped.He whips out his cell phone, which doesn't explode, and calls the most incompetent  dispatcher in the Korean peninsula, triggering the most epically inept rescue operation in human history. Apparently, about the only things that work well in Korea are Kias and cell phone towers (and the battery in Jung so's phone, which lasts forever, and even his car battery which lasts even longer. Without exploding) because it turns out the tunnel was built by the most incompetent construction company in all of Asia, one that put in too few support rods and doesn't know how many fans it installed, nor where they installed them, and didn't bother to draw up the blue prints to any kind of scale or accuracy. And, which is in charge of building Hado Tunnel Number Two, a few feet away from where Jung so is trapped. After about an hour, said company starts lobbying to resume blasting on its new tunnel because, hey, Jung so is trapped in our first shoddily built tunnel so he's a goner so let's stop wasting time here and get on with it. All of which drives the rescue commander, Dae kyong (played by Dal su Oh of Oldboy fame)\u2015the only competent man in the entire Korean government\u2015nuts to the point he drinks a bottle of urine in solidarity with Jung so.No, seriously.All of which emphasizes the point that, if you're trapped in a tunnel in Korea (or a haunted island, or a sealed apartment) you'd best start thinking about getting yourself out of this pickle because the government honchos in this movie don't put a whole lot of value on your individual soul. I don't know if that's Seong hun Kim's particularly political viewpoint or the result of having a lot of crazy people to your north with nukes, but it doesn't take long before the ministries and bureaus and the population decide to write Jung so off and get on with it. Now why they would allow the obviously inept construction company to get on with it, I can't say, but it may be due to the particularly gruesome death of a rescue worker (apparently saw blades in Korea are made by Samsung) which is blamed on Jung so's wife, who apparently has the last say on whether Jung so should be rescued or not (someone should check to see if she recently upped his life insurance). Scratch of the ole noggin' here because rescue workers who die on duty in the US are considered heroes, not victims. 'Course, we don't have crazy people to our north with nukes.

And THE TUNNEL turns out to be the best survival film apart from TRAIN TO BUSAN.THE TUNNEL has a great deal of tension throughout. The film's premise is built very well. You do feel the suspense at right moments. The film delivers well on the technical front. The cinematography captures the splendid visuals very well. There aren't any hiccups throughout the entire film and you feel the character's pain. Ha Jung Woo is super solid in this film. This is his first film I've seen. Doona Bae and Oh Dal Su give terrific performances. The few action sequences are very well shot.And yes, this didn't let me move from my seat. I kept on watching and enjoying it till the end. It's a film that can be watched again. Full marks to the director Seong Hun Kim for executing a brilliant survival tale with excellence.Overall, THE TUNNEL is an excellent film that can be seen multiple times for its cinematic excellence and a hard hitting indirect message to all."], "Sentiment Score": 0.5722727272727273}, "1210": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "34": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1008": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "117": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "817": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "945": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "120": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["The undatables is an ordinary drama.

Thought I have to balance the negative review before mine cos I really enjoyed this show ( which, by the way, is called The Undateables on VIKI ).\nFirst though, let's review the components of the K drama formula which you'll soon encounter once you become a regular : TWO GUYS pursuing ONE GIRL, though guy is never totally viable. LEAD MALE is rich & LEAD GIRL is not, with girl introducing guy to the simple pleasures he missed out on. FIRST MEETING OF MAIN COUPLE is angry awkward. LOTS OF ACCIDENTAL occasions early on for main duo to touch hug ( Aaargh ! VERY ANNOYING, by the way ! ). AT LEAST ONE PARENT of main duo is dead. AT LEAST  MAJOR CRISIS for main duo before inevitable happy ending. Yep, sounds like a recipe for boredom but it isn't if you care about the characters.\nSo, there are some exceptions, though this show sticks to most of the template. Formula aside, it's the other stuff that makes a good K Drama, like the story script, emotional connection & quality of the cast. Like a few other under rated K dramas, this one delivers in all areas.\nCentral couple are vital, obviously, & Hwang Jung Eum as the girl & Nam Goong Min as the guy have great chemistry in my opinion. She has some detractors on the VIKI forums which seriously baffles me. The support cast are also good, with Coach Yang a deserved fan fave.\nThe story ? The motley crew of the VIKI title ( as the main duo team up to get them dates ) are consistently entertaining, with the last third of the show being especially effective in that regard. And that shockI referred to in my heading, well, I love being surprised and a quarter of the way in, HJE does something which was exciting and brave, considering the general prudish conservatism of K Drama.

It's another poor girl meets rich boy Korean melodrama. Korean television will tell this same story over and over again until the end of time, and, lord knows I've seen a crap ton of these shows to say the least. Summary Verdict: this one's not bad.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Ha Ji won plays Gil Ra im; a poor & humble stunt woman trying to make ends meet working in the movie industry. Hyun Bin plays Kim Joo won; a wealthy & arrogant heir to an upscale department store chain. Joo won mistakes Ra im as an actress his famous brother once dated, and as a result, they subsequently meet & spend some time together by accident. Need I even bother expounding?...comedy, romance, drama ensue. You know the format: she's the pretty but tough tomboyish type with no time for nonsense in her life, he's the straight laced rich guy who works hard but has plenty of time for whatever nonsense he wishes. The two meet and he begins to soon fall for her. She's less than impressed with him though, so he's got his work cut out for him. The tried and true staple of K drama loves stories is on full display here; he's constantly presented with a series of arranged dates to meet a future wife from the same ilk as his own family, but he's not interested in this and wants to find his own love. His stature and eligibility means he pursued by an endless supply of suitable beauties, so his ego is a bit unchecked in regards to what a great catch he thinks he is. As such, he is somewhat baffled by the fact that this lower class girl doesn't jump at the chance to be with him, couldn't care less about his standing, and won't give him the time of day. He's also never met any woman quite like this before in his life, and she's pretty easy to look at, so he's more than intrigued smitten determined etc. He therefore decides to use his power and wealth to intrude in her life in order to win her over, which initially backfires of course, until perhaps the  can eventually find some common ground to stand on if this relationship was meant to be.We're rolling right along with the standard fare for this genre over the first half dozen episodes or so; it's workable and kept fairly tight for the most part as the two leads come together bit by bit. It's all pretty much par for the course, then, BAM (SPOILERS); on a mountain biking date one day, the  stray off course and stumble upon a strange old shop & restaurant in the middle of nowhere. While there, they imbibe a magical potion which causes their souls to switch bodies. As such, a whole new layer to the proceedings then comes into play in this series.While this wacky out of nowhere plot aspect of the show may seem absurd (and it is, of course), it does actually work, and, it works quite well. It both helps to break up the status quo for a typical K drama, and, also serves to further benefit the story as well as a whole. These two characters were having a hard time developing a common ground & relationship the old fashioned way, so perhaps they will find love via this mystical method instead. Accordingly, the two opposites come to understand and appreciate each other more by spending time in each other's body life.The twist provides for a great deal of comedy to be mined here, as the CEO dude now has to lead the life of the poor tough girl, and stunt woman girl has to run a company and be subjected to high society pressures. While they've switched bodies, they also each take the opportunity to investigate the other, turn away the other's potential love interests, see each other's friends and siblings half naked, etc. It's all pretty cute. This is not without problems though, as each time it rains, the bodies are switched back and forth; so, there's a chance he might get caught in her body while trying to perform a risky stunt that he's ill prepared for, or she does something unknowingly that puts him in danger due to his health problems, etc.Eventually, the two leads get down to the business of trying to figure out how to stop switching bodies all the time, so they can get back to their normal lives before somebody finds out or something goes horribly wrong. With some help from their friends and family, and with a little luck, perhaps all will work out in the end, and maybe the two leads will be able to find love along the way. The cast all put in acceptable to solid work, and just about all characters are likable enough. Perhaps the best role is that of the CEO's brother; a K pop star known as Oska, who leads a mostly carefree life of luxury when he's not lamenting the loss of his true love that got away. The stunt woman has a huge fan crush on him that comically belies her no nonsense tough girl persona, to the point of her being elated with scoring concert tickets, sleeping in Oska themed socks, etc. And, though Oska competes with his brother to some degree, he mostly serves as an intermediary for the two leads while they work on their budding romance.All in all, this show is pretty solid. It doesn't go on forever (though it could have been trimmed a little), and it's kept pretty lighthearted for the most part; it's mostly a charming comedy romance drama, with little heavy handed evil plot villain schemes. Be prepared for a melodramatic final act though, as this is Korean melodrama after all.Bottom Line:   out of  stars. I'll give it an !", "I am so happy to come across this show. I was so bored of sex, violence and drama and then, I found Secret Garden. This show gives you love in its purest form as possible. When I watch it, I can feel butterflies flying in my stomach one minute , then the tears roll down on my cheeks and a broad smile occupy my face at the end of each show. Characters are well put, funny and deep. You can feel and understand what they are going through. Story line is enhanced with side stories and never boring. The cinematography is breath taking, like most of far eastern movies the scenery brings forth the emotions. To sum up, please give this show a try, I am sure you ll be hooked :)", "I really didn't think I would like this drama. I watched Boys Over Flowers and ended up really disliking the whole series because I couldn't get over how unlikeable some of the characters were. When I started Secret Garden, I thought Oh great another story about a bratty rich guy who traumatizes his girlfriend into liking him... I bet the female lead looks like she's strong and then becomes a blubbering wimp or insensitive ice queen. I could have not been MORE WRONG. OK some may watch episode one and say...well sure looks like it to me! ...but it's not. This is how BoF should have tackled the rich boy poor girl love story.OK to be fair I was not a big Joo Won fan for most of the series (His character alone made me question the series as a whole). Surprisingly the one who enchanted me was Gil Ra Im, and the adorable Oska! < I stuck with the series because it was refreshing to see the leading lady bite back when Joo Won was being a jerk. When he hurt her she would tell him, and she never gave in to his sharp remarks, and eventually Joo Won realized the power of his own words and slowly opened himself to loving her. When you fall in love and root for a character you once disliked, that's the power of great story telling. What is more amazing about this drama, even though it followed some typical Kdrama conventions it did so in a way that you were surprised and shocked that they worked in some big revelations. It brought out the true meaning of 'destiny' and it made the series as a whole more heartfelt and touching.The switching bodies theme...I thought eeeeeeh this will be needless and over the top but it was really well done! At first it took some getting used to, but it actually made for some of the more touching moments in the story, and the funniest. Joo Won swooning over Oska made me laugh to tears. Lastly, I find one of the biggest faults with many dramas is the story always feels like it tapered off without thought at the very end. I loved that Secret Garden tied up all the loose ends in the most touching of ways. It felt complete to me, and it made me feel like the love experienced in the stories was true and sincere.Overall, those of you who watch the first couple of episodes and are not impressed, I say stick with it! You'll be glad you did. All the characters are wonderful to watch and develop into three dimensional people that you'll root for and cheer on! It's a fantastic love story that makes you want to find your soulmate. :D", "Every time I watch a show from Korea, I am never disappointed. This one is no different. An emotional roller coaster show with fantastic characters, beautiful cinematography and amazing soundtrack. You will fall in love with the show and its characters. The script is well written and the actors and actresses have such chemistry.You will find yourself laughing, crying, smiling and being angry right along with them.A word of caution though. You will find yourself wanting to start the next episode once you reach the end of the one you are watching because it is that good and addicting. I was sad that I got to the last episode and it ended. So, I started watching from the first episode again. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.", "The title head pretty much described it all, with such unique story line of modern fairy tale and the harsh reality, it was sure hardcore for everyone who watched the whole series. They have deviated from the usual KDrama style, plot and conflicts. It is fantasy by the way, but the great thing is that it was not greatly emphasized in the early episodes (the switching part). They did not spend most of the time in different bodies, in contrast to what others would have expected. Sure it was fun to watch the actors played so well but in the latter part it played a big role in story development and made the story what it is: destiny, love, magic and everything else in between.More on the deviating from usual KDrama trend, let's go to love triangles. Pretty much empty, for the first part again I expected Oska and Yoon Seul to be big third parties in the rel. of the main characters (just like in Full House) but again wasn't interesting anymore. Another thing is the conflict between Joo Won's mother. I thought it would be another main conflict but the theme of the story prevailed : Love conquers all! I would also like to commend the writer for such great plot. I love that she did not revealed everything in the first parts, opposed to many KDramas that tells the social status of both protagonists, family background and conflicts at the start of the story. If it had been like that, it would not make the story interesting (I was really guessing what could have happened to Ra Im's father, or Joo Won's life changing accident, nor how the Oska Yoon Seul bitterly ended) .It was obviously not a character driven plot, it was more on what's going to happen to Gil Ra Im and Joo Won next that would help clarify the past.There were many metaphors, symbols and recurring themes (eg little mermaid) and if you had not appreciated this series, I say you missed it. Clearly, it was a work of a genius to think of such great script and plot.Another common mistakes of Kdramas is that you would end up loving the actors because of empty reasons. Secret Garden got me so hooked up to Gil Ra Im and Joo Won that i did not bother searching their names in Google when i was watching the series (I only did that after finishing the series). Their undeniable chemistry would sure fire up the intensity of the key plots, making them effective actors. BOTTOMLINE: I fell in love with the characters! Not with the actors !The ending was absolutely perfect. It wasn't a fairy tale like ending. Ra Im did not turn into Cinderella, nor Joo Won into Prince Charming. In the end, it was their love that prevailed amidst imperfections in their relationship and differences. Finishing the story with the lines, We still don't have a single wedding picture, but we fall in love every single day, like living a magical life. That's what I true magic brings into our lives: blissful love beyond imperfectionsThe story itself was well written, plot was well thought, the casting and the chemistry of the actors have pretty much set the tone for the success of the series. This may sound biased but overall i say this is the BEST KOREAN Drama i have seen in years, and I would be sure there won't be any KDRAMAS that will be as good as this in the coming years."], "Sentiment Score": 0.860625}, "823": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["Yes it is.He has lost his job and takes care of the household and the baby. She is a director at an English language school and has an affair with her first lover. It's a linear story with an inevitable ending, told with eye for detail and with humour. Although the story and setting are not new, it has a surprising ending, which is emphasized by the words 'happy end'.", "Happy End is a South Korean film about a woman who's having an affair while her husband is unemployed.It stars Choi Min sik, Jeon Do yeon and Ju Jin mo.It was written and directed by Jung Ji woo.In the movie,Bora is a successful career woman who becomes involved with her destructive ex lover, Kim. Bora's home life is a snore: she's mother to an infant child and her husband, Seo has lost his job, leaving Bora as the family's sole breadwinner. The jobless Seo hasn't been just wandering around parks and reading romance novels as first thought.One day, Min ki accidentally stumbles upon a key, that belongs to his wife, and is unfamiliar that realizes that something is going on, and he's collecting evidence.Happy End centers namely Bora,Kim and Min ki.They are imperfect people but not despicable human beings. They are all very much human in every way that matters. As a result of all of these humanly needs and wants, Bora is unable to stop going back to Kim even though she seems physically and emotionally damaged by their continued affair. Kim has realized that he is hooked on her, and is very aware of his (jealously  driven) actions toward her and her family. Without each other, they have no passion in their life, and so they must keep going back to each other.While Min ki is depressed with his inability to find a job and stuck who so called feminine chores like grocery shopping, cooking, and doing the laundry.Unfortunately,this is a big letdown especially in a patriarchal Korean society.Aside from that,it also damages his confidence that his wife has lost interest in him.The movie tries to bring these people to the viewers and the humanity of these characters.Also,it brings about how these people are susceptible to wrong doings and immoral acts brought about by their weaknesses and their situations in life.The film has explicit sex scenes and violent acts.But overall,it was an exploration of human behavior in the three main characters presented in it.What makes this film effective as well is the brilliant acting of the actors and actress involved which makes it absorbing from beginning to end.I definitely would recommend this to anyone who loves great films.", "I believe this is the fourth or fifth film I've watched starring Min Sik Choi, who is quite an accomplished actor. The DVD cover proclaims Happy End to be one of the most controversial Korean films ever made! It's not difficult to imagine why this film might cause controversy. On the one hand, shortly after the film begins, a semi explicit sex scene takes place that seems to go on for a gratuitously long time. But nothing is shown during the sex scenes that wasn't shown in the much less controversial, more traditional Korean period piece, Chunhyang. Perhaps it is the nature of the sex taking place, that of illicit extramarital liaisons, that contributed to its controversy. But I believe the bulk of the film's controversy is due to what ultimately emerges as the film's theme.This film could be viewed as a sadistic wet dream pandering to certain men who are disgruntled by what they feel is an emasculating and increasingly common situation of this modern age: that of the unemployed, stay at home husband. Except that when this unemployed husband is home, he spends most of his time watching soap operas, only occasionally lifting a finger to help with the baby. Instead of looking for work, he kills time each day crouched in the used book store, reading romance novels, to the chagrin of the store owner, whose policy regarding such patrons is less welcoming than that of Barnes & Noble. The husband is mopey, and never expresses affection towards or sexual attraction to his wife. Since he barely helps out around the house, when his wife gets home from work she ends up having to do the cleaning and the chores on top of her job, even though he has much more free time and is home much more than she is. As a companion, he is ineffectual and impotent. At one point during the final third of the film, as she's alone at home on her hands and knees scrubbing the floor, she tells herself that she has to end it. It's unclear at the time whether she's talking about her relationship with her husband, or with her co worker Il bum. For the most part, she endures the imbalance in her relationship with her husband without much complaint, perhaps contritely due to a sense of guilt she possesses over the fact that she is engaged in an affair.It's revealed that Il Bum is actually baby Yun's father, and that they were a couple before her current husband came into her life and married her. Why would she leave her former lover to be with such a pathetic, and ultimately deranged and lethal man? There is an indication that at one time he was successful and financially more secure. But her past and present boyfriend is more attractive, more passionate, and more considerate. For reasons that aren't fully explained, she reacts negatively to his small, caring gestures. When he buys a toothbrush that she can use when she's over at his place, she lashes out. She does the same when she discovers toys that he's bought for the baby. She seems conflicted by emotions of desire, guilt, and annoyance with both the men in her life and her situation in general. There is also at least one major plot hole in this film that I could not overlook. At one point near the end of the film, she mixes a bit of sleeping medication into her baby's formula, so that she can leave her in the apartment to go confront her lover and break off their relationship. But her husband could come home at any minute, and yet she apparently doesn't stop to consider that. Perhaps the simple, though inadequate answer to the questions raised by her acts is that she just isn't a very sensible woman. But nor is she portrayed as being mentally slow. Distracted, certainly.Inevitably, her husband comes home to find the baby there alone, and eventually discovers that he's being cheated on. He premeditates a vicious revenge, in which he terrifies her before committing brutal murder, bludgeoning her over and over with her lover's knife which he stole from the former's home, gradually slowing to pause and stare at the body for a couple moments in between stabs. He then uses the weapon to frame her lover for the murder he's committed. The last time we see Il Bum is in custody, being pressured into giving up his right to remain silent without a lawyer. We're only left to imagine what becomes of him.There's a misanthropic sense of self satisfaction in the supposedly clever irony of the film's title. Not knowing what the filmmaker's intentions were, I'm led to wonder after watching this film if those who wrote and directed it consider the end which befell Bora and her child's true father to be a happy one. The superior tone of one of the previous comments here glibly indicates with a wink and a nod that she deserved to be horribly and brutally slayed by her baby's touching motherly daddy because SHE'D gone too far. How alarmingly vile.", "I am into korean cinema. They have been giving me some of the deepest experiences with recent years cinema. From the current crop of (at least) competent korean filmmakers, we have Wook Park and Kim Ki Duk. Both of them have added value to my life with some of their films. Apart from them i found lots of competence and thrill in other films from there.Now i saw this. It's impressive, not powerful and life altering like Oldboy or Bin jip but still worthy.Let me remark on how this is built. The film begins and (practically) ends with  really exaggerated and intense scenes: it starts with a visceral obsessed sex scene and ends with a brutal killing. Both are enhanced beyond what was need to make a statement and both go a little bit beyond what we would normally tolerate in such scenes. In the middle of these scenes, we are given scenes of common, even dull daily routine. Cooking, nursering, reading, working, eating. Just that. So, the scenes are extreme moments of ordinary lives. It's what the film is about. The killing is an exaggerated, violent and uncommon reaction to a relatively ordinary situation of adultery. The film visually corresponds to this, so we have a case of great adequation between what we see and what we are told. That is good enough to please me.This is flawed in the way it purely relies on the effect these scenes should have on you. The risks are minimized to those two scenes and controversy they might (and did) cause. Well, i think the film works relatively well, but the scenes didn't shock me so much (the last  years gave us films like Irreversible). Still, what stays is good experience, because the whole film is about making us numb and unreactive, and than shake us and suddenly wake us up. It's relatively thin but it works, and most of all, it does it cinematically, it does it in the eye.The artistic work is great. The cinematography is perfectly aware of colours, saturations, and composition elements. It's beautiful, and something we see over and over in every korean film, even the worst ones. Visually, korean cinema doesn't seem to be as depurated and abstract as Japanese imagery, instead it is a pleasant relaxed depiction of beauty, with western concepts and influences and, yet, very rooted in an eastern society. I suppose it corresponds to where South Korea stands culturally these days.My opinion:  ", "An excellently performed movie about our age of the equality of the genders.

It's worth checking out if you're into this sort of thing.SPOILERS AHEAD!This show is similarly themed to Le Femme Nikita, Leon the Professional, etc. So, you basically know what you're getting here (i.e. young discarded girl trains to become a killer). There's nothing really new or groundbreaking involved, but it is executed & paced quite well, and is packed with lots of typical South Korean cinematic goodness.The lead character (Yeon Jin) is played by Han Groo. She is more than capable enough throughout the show in accomplishing what's asked of her (which is quite a lot actually). She plays a cute & likable, albeit tough, high school girl who lives alone with her single mother. She can't seem to stay out of trouble though, and one day she gets tossed into a series of events that culminate in her & her friends being sought after by some very bad people. Eventually, she gets tracked down by the bad guys and as result, her mother and many of her friends are killed, and she is left for dead.She miraculously survives the onslaught however, and is taken in by an older female assassin who nurses her back to life and then trains her as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Yeon Jin looks to her newfound mentor as somewhat of a surrogate mother that can provide her both guidance and direction in life, and with her back ground in martial arts and desire to seek vengeance, Yeon Jin eagerly & quickly absorbs all the killing knowledge & training she can from this woman.After recovering from her near death experience, and receiving her combat assassin training, Yeon Jin sets out on the most difficult task imaginable; going back to high school as a new transfer student. I found this part of the show to be highly amusing; it's not meant to be funny per se, but the juxtaposition of the two opposite worlds she now inhabits and has to juggle is sufficiently entertaining. During the course of the school day, she reluctantly becomes more and more concerned with fitting in at school, making new girl friends, experiences angst over her feelings for a boy classmate that likes her, etc (i.e. typical high school girl stuff). And, at lunch, she's on the roof of a building with a high powered rifle trying to assassinate someone per her mentor's orders.Everything is moving along swimmingly to begin with, but Yeon Jin eventually discovers that her mentor is not quite who she appears to be and has ulterior motives that simply can't be abided. Even though Yeon Jin has long since become a cold hearted killer, she still knows right from wrong, and is soon pitted against her mentor and the evil organization she belongs to in a fight to death.This show is a little bit unusual in the way it continually tries to straddle the line from sometimes being a simple & cute high school girl drama, and then at the flick of a switch, suddenly devolves into a remorseless & seedy bloodbath. For what is essentially a made for TV Korean melodrama, this show is often INCREDIBLY VIOLENT; you'll find more violent stuff in various movies of course, but I can't recall any previously made Korean TV show that is as delightfully & frequently vicious as this show often is. The producers and director of this show obviously have no problem letting the blood flow here at will, and there's a fair amount of nudity as well if I recall correctly (but not from any of the lead characters). For a TV show that essentially revolves around the dramatic life of a high school girl, it's as down & dirty as can possibly be.Now, this show is only  episodes long, but I don't know why this is; I can't imagine this show was canceled in such a short time for lack of ratings, and the story seems to be purposely made to be completed at the end of the rd episode. Three episodes is very short and highly unusual for KTV, and I can't help but wonder why this wasn't just cut down to a  hour movie format, or wasn't fleshed out into a longer TV show. I'm not even sure if the short run time is actually a benefit or detriment to this show though; on the one hand, everything is tightly paced & compacted by the sheer nature of needing to get everything wrapped up within the  episodes. On the other hand, I enjoyed it quite a bit; so much so, that I would have most certainly watched some more episodes if there were any to be had. This show ultimately ended with a scene that left open the opportunity for some type of follow up show series, or what have you, but I've not heard of anything that might indicate as much as of the writing of this review.As is the case with any action drama TV show, Little Girl K can get a tad over the top and a slight bit corny at times, but it doesn't do so very often. And, with such a short run time, you can easily forgive & forget any such flaws you might find with it in contrast with the overall scheme of things.Bottom Line: I enjoyed this show, A LOT!...If you're looking for a quick fix to quench some blood thirst, and satisfy your need for Korean action melodrama, then this might be right up your alley. And if it turns out not to be your thing once it concludes, at least you didn't have to devote weeks upon weeks of your life watching it. out of  stars!", "Pretty good Korean version of La Femme Nikita. It has the same basic plot line.

Cinderella's Sister (aka Cinderella's Stepsister) is a melodramatic cryathon that aired on Korean TV a year or two ago. For anybody who's not familiar with this genre, it's basically just a soap opera with a set run time and (hopefully) an end goal. There are loads of Korean dramas like this, and, well my Korean girlfriend (God bless her) really likes this stuff and wants me to watch with her, so yeah, I watched this whole series!SPOILERS AHEAD!Your basic story: Widowed winery owner with young carefree princess daughter meets unprivileged widow with standoffish evil stepsister daughter. Widower and widow soon get married. Widow is more or less just looking to cease going from one loser relationship to another, and she succeeds in accomplishing this by wedding the winery owner. As a result, their daughters are thrust together and are mostly left to get along as newly anointed sisters.For the first  episodes or so, the story focuses on the  families getting together, at which time the daughters are  year old high school girls. The daughters clash from the beginning, even though the widower's daughter tries her best to welcome her new step sister with open arms. The widower's daughter is bubbly, sheltered, and a little annoying, but she's kind and doesn't mean any harm. On the other hand, the widow's daughter is an abrasive ass; yeah, she's had a tough life to date, but the amount of undeserved vitriol she spews on her newfound sister makes you not want to like her character at all. Both girls have a crush on some older dude who's working at the winery. Eventually, this dude falls in love with the widow's daughter, but ends up leaving the winery before love can blossom between the two. He doesn't really want to leave his new love though, so he does so via perhaps the most unmanly and idiotic scapegoat way possible; instead of just telling the girl he loves her and wants to be with her, he sneaks off to board a train without any notice, and gives a letter (written in Spanish no less) to the widower's daughter to pass along to her sister, which basically begs the widow's daughter to come stop him from leaving if she loves him. And, he does this knowing the two stepsisters hate each other at this point, and that the widower's daughter is still in love with him, and not to mention the fact the widow's daughter is just learning Spanish. WTF???...This is our hero???...If I tried this nonsense in real life, I'd either get laughed at or ignored, and probably both.The series then skips forward to when the daughters are in their early twenties, and, goes forward from there as all the main characters eventually re converge. Dude who took the train out of town shows back up in the sisters lives, and they all have to eventually work together to save the winery. Dude is still upset that widow's daughter didn't stop him from leaving when they were younger. Perhaps he should have been more direct or used a better method years ago, or maybe tried to call or write his love sometime during the  years he was away. Idiot!The rest of the series pretty much goes as follows: love work family related problems crop up, the characters cry yell do something absurd, melodramatic happy romantic music ensues, issues are resolved, then repeat until the story arc is completed. In the meantime, everyone stares off into the distance, and reminisces A LOT! There's also many misunderstandings and wild changes in character's demeanors as events unfold, people faint or die upon hearing bad shocking news, there's about a billion instances of someone grabbing another person's arm as they're about to walk away, buckets of tears are shed, and of course, there's always some evil person(s) company behind the scenes, and (perhaps) ulterior motives among all the main characters, etc.This show really tested my limits I rolled my eyes often at the heavy formulaic melodrama involved here (my GF was not pleased with this!). That being disclosed, I did kinda like this show overall in some strange sort of way, and there's a good bit to like here; both lead actresses gave solid performances throughout, although I could barely tolerate the stepsister character most of the time. The widower was perhaps those most fair and stand up character I've ever seen in any Korean melodrama. And, it was good to see the  sisters grow some over time and eventually come to an understanding, which led to a nice touching moment in the finale. Also, I generally felt bad for the widower's daughter who mostly got crapped on by just about everybody throughout the entire series.As for the male leads, Chun Jung Myung did what he was asked quite well, but his character was not very likable either, although it should be noted that he and the often unlikeable stepsister seemed a perfect match for one another. As for Taecyeon; he has a nice body for the ladies to drool over, but his acting is questionable at best. In his defense though, he's given nothing to do other than follow the stepsister around like a sickly puppy or overhear random conversations for the sake of advancing plot points.I may have liked this story if it were streamlined into a shorter miniseries format and it cut down on the nonsense some. But, if drawn out to a longer format (with no end in sight), I might have faked my own death in order to avoid watching it. However, I do like this KTV method of airing shows for a specific number of episodes, then moving on to the next show. This particular show, while not without faults, works well enough to recommend ONLY if you're a fan of familiar with K dramas. If not, it's borderline excruciating. out of  stars.", "You really should watch this series , I wish if they make another season of this series because it's really emotional , thrilling , and dramatic story.

Starring the rather lovely Song Hye kyo, playing an internet novelist and the curiously monikered Rain as a wildly popular young movie star, on the one hand it's a good example of the quirky mix of slapstick comedy interspersed with rather sobering moments of heartbreak and frustration experienced by the characters. The surprising fact is that the first episode follows a similar plot line to House of Sand and Fog, which certainly wasn't a comedy and was absolutely full of despair. Girl inherits lovely house on the coast from parents, struggles financially, circumstances lead to her losing most of her possessions and having her home sold off underneath her feet, new owner has little sympathy at first. That's fortunately where the comparison ends! Plenty of moments of Song Hye kyo screwing her face up in disgust by some awkward thing she's said or done, and Rain (wearing his rather strange low cut male cleavage shirts) glancing into the ether whilst biting his lip do eventually lead to a building relationship between a very odd couple.

And wow, was i ever impressed.The story is essentially simple in its premise but has been made interesting by adding a mix of wit, slapstick humour and a great cast. I am not particularly a Rain fan and have never seen Song Hye Kyo in anything previous to watching this show, but i was greatly impressed with their acting and the chemistry they shared.I found myself from being completely non plussed by the whole drama to start off with, to constantly giggling and squeeing at the television; a reaction that has rarely happened in all the years i've been watching TV dramas.The only thing holding me back from giving it a   is the horrid wardrobe Yeong Jae sports. I can't remember how many times i balked at the screen because he walked into the scene wearing yet another low cut, cleavage revealing top and ridiculously mismatched pants, but i'm sure i would have made myself thoroughly hammered if i'd made a drinking game out of it ;D Rain's man cleavage aside, this is a wonderful drama to watch; i'd definitely recommend it :)", "This is a great starter for those who are interested in K drama, or looking for a light, romance comedy drama.. It's about this girl, Ji Eun, an aspiring script writer, who inherited this house named Full House(also the title of the drama) from her parents.

During her vacation she met this superstar, Young Jae who coincidently the one whom Ji Eun's friends sold her house to. It'll later get all complicated and leads to a marriage contract between them. Ji Eun will then falls for Young Jae who's in love with his childhood friend, Hae Won who is in love with their other friend, Min Hyuk who likes Ji Eun. It looks kinda complicated, but it's quite easy to understand, really... A two thumbs up for this K drama, mainly because of the chemistry between the two main leads, Rain and Song Hye Kyo as Young Jae and Ji Eun. A word of caution to those who are new to k dramas... This will definitely hook you to other k dramas, and you'll be left to wanting more k dramas.. You have been warned....

Full House (as well as other Korean TV series) became a hit in our country a few years back. I didn't mind it because I already have a big respect and fondness for its film industry.What got me interested was the young pop idol Rain. After watching his documentary on Discovery channel, and being interested in his skills as a performer (not to mention he's so cute), I started looking for his first TV series because of the good reviews. So I got the complete  episodes of Full House. What started off as an interesting journey became marked with sleepless nights (trying to finish at least   episodes a day), laughter and giggles, sentimental sniffles, excitement, anxiety, you name it.The story revolves around four main characters. A crazy but beautiful writer girl who owns a house and nothing more, and was duped by friends who sold her house without her knowledge; a movie actor (Rain) who buys the house and treats her like a maid in exchange for a place to stay; a fashion designer who is the superstar's best friend and secret love; and a rich, handsome producer who is interested in the writer girl. Eventually, the first two couple engage in a business marriage contract for publicity, while the last two tries to break them apart.Granted, the show has its flaws in the script. Sometimes, actions tend to be exaggerated. I'd get confused and frustrated with the leading lady's inability to leave Rain when she is totally mistreated. The fashion designer lacks the charm to sweep both men off their feet and is portrayed as a weak character despite her successful career. The other leading man is totally gorgeous and I sometimes wish the writer ends up with him instead. The superstar is quite a bit infuriating with his childish, sneaky ways, his tantrums, his inability to acknowledge love, and his stubborn, rude ways. But when you see him shed a tear in pain, arrrgh. There goes my heart. I believe that's what the writer girl felt too. We just couldn't leave him alone.Other flaws in the script? There are no violent kissing scenes. Not that I am complaining. From the very start, the show sweeps you off your feet with the development of each character, from the moment they all meet and weave in and out of each others' lives, and eventually becoming more involved with one another. It was one hell of a ride in the senses, to the very end when you would have wanted them to be more passionate physically.Add to that other characters: the writer's two scheming friends who conned her; the superstar's mom, dad, grandma and levelheaded boss...all have interesting quirks that add to the spice of this romantic comedy.I may be harping too much about this and leave you disappointed if you watch it. Well, if you're Asian like me, you will most likely relate to it more than the Westerners, who will see this as a bore (staying together in a house with such an explosive chemistry and nothing is ever happening will most likely raise your brows).I do like the show, though, and it's two thumbs up for me, simply because it draws so much emotion from me (just as it did My Sassy Girl where the odd couple really made me laugh and cry in ways I didn't expect), and it leaves me wanting more. Well, I also did want it to end soon and happily.I still hesitate to watch another Korean TV series (it drains the hell out of me trying to complete the show in one viewing). I will still prefer watching the movies. But for once, Full House has left me happy and dreaming, and craving for the innocent romance of younger days."], "Sentiment Score": 0.7935}, "511": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Negative", "Reviews": ["I recommend you to watch it , it's comedy , dramatic, romantic , all characters acting is very good !

This doctor soon realizes Shi Ohn's autism allows him to absorb and retain all sorts of medical knowledge that a normal person couldn't. Shi Ohn is encouraged to learn and study everything he can until he grows to adulthood, wherein he's given an internship at a children's hospital to see if he can put his extraordinary mind to use in real world practice.Unfortunately, the autism that makes Shi Ohn so knowledgeable in the first place, also makes it difficult for him to communicate with people and grasp the nuances of social interaction in an imperfect society. He can't express his emotions properly, has trouble understanding his own feelings, and can't comprehend why people act and do the things they do (much less understand lies, jokes, ulterior motives, etc). Since he's both incredibly book smart and socially awkward, he's as equally resented as he is feared by his contemporaries; his genius might be able to solve problems they cannot, but he also might do something incredibly stupid that would put lives and careers at risk. Thus, a tentative relationship is born between Shi Ohn and everyone that now surrounds him to see if he can begin to fit in to society and be of help to the hospital and its patients.This is a little bit of an unusual show for a K drama. It's more of a straight forward drama about the growth of an autistic man, and those around him, more than anything else. It does retain many familiar elements of this genre; there's some melodrama, antagonists, character growth, a little humor, and somewhat of a romantic angle, but if you're looking for some juicy or outrageous or angst ridden makjang drama, this ain't the show for you.Joo Won is the star of the show in his portrayal of Shi Ohn. This could not have been an easy part to play, but Joo Won is up to the task and remarkably believable throughout. He's got all the autistic mannerisms and ticks down pat, but more impressive is the way he's able to convey his emotions in such an effective manner without breaking character. He has to deal with a lot; being bullied, reconciling with his estranged parents, sorting out his first feelings of love, living on his own, making friends, handling disappointment, and overcoming his disability, all while he's trying to prove himself as a capable doctor and basically just get by in life. Joo Won really drives this show with his performance, and the more things progress, the more you can almost sense what he's thinking & feeling without him even uttering a word. Nicely done, Joo Won!Joo Sang Wook & Moon Chae Won fill the other  most prominent parts; Joo Sang Wook plays the head doc in charge of the children's ward, and Moon Chae Won plays the prominent young female doc in the wing. Both of them were quite efficient at portraying opposite ends of the spectrum that help Shi Ohn in their own way. He's demanding and won't approve of Shi Ohn until he's satisfied, and she's kindly and supportive of Shi Ohn at almost every turn. The rest of the cast is rounded out by some hospital trustee upper management types, the kids in the sick ward, and the rest of interns & docs & nurses; they were all effective enough in their roles portraying an antagonist or benefactor or side story character or what have you.Writing, direction, and production were solid. The story is relatively well told, and it does make its way from start to finish rather well without ever getting too bogged down. And, of course, it all looks great on screen; this is modern day HD KTV after all, so that's almost a given with any show that's provided at least a modest budget.If I have any complaints to level against this show, it would be the attempt to (SPOILERS) incorporate a love angle between Moon Chae Won's character and Shi Ohn; this show probably would have better off without that aspect, and, instead just stuck to its overall motif of overcoming adversity and character growth. I suppose I could complain some about some of the annoying young hospital kids, and the standard drive by method of giving short shrift to various medical terms & disorders, but young kids usually can't act very well anyway, and, you can't expect the writers & cast to be experts in the medical field when considering the inherent time constraints involved with airing these shows.Summary: It isn't going to work for everybody, but I must admit that I quite enjoyed this show for the most part. The story is better than decent, there are several good performances (Joo Won, in particular, is outstanding), and, I thought everything was fairly well executed overall. It's ultimately a fairly sweet K drama tale about a disadvantaged man coping with life, and, the realization that he's not really any better or worse at accomplishing this than any normal person trying to do the same. I actually found this to be a somewhat unique & rather heartwarming show (and, I'm saying this as a jaded, long time viewer of KTV melodramas).Bottom Line: Well Recommended!  out of  stars on the KTV Drama Scale!", "I just came to know about this show from the remake.

Chae Won Moon also deserves a special mention too. Her interplay with the other characters really helped bring the show alive, and the fact that she lights up the screen whenever she's on it makes it very pleasant watching.

JEON Tae il is one of Korea's two leading martyrs in the creation of labor unions in Korea.  A poor young tailor, who was appalled at the abuses of the workers (mainly young girls) in sewing sweat shops    and struggled through legal code (written in old fashioned Chinese characters, rather than in the alphabet most Koreans learned to read) to find the provisions that guarded the rights of such workers.  He (with his friends) succeeded in getting the press to pay attention (briefly) to both the abuses of employers and governmental neglect of its regulatory duty.  But once the press got bored, scornful labor department officials told them they were unpatriotic for complaining and the employers simply cracked down harder.  To try to get greater attention, JEON set his copy of the legal code, and himself, on fire    and ran through the streets of downtown Seoul shouting We are not machines, enforce the labor code.  His death apparently mobilized other young workers, leading to the creation of unions powerful enough to get a hearing on the issue of workers' rights.None of the above should be viewed as a spoiler.

That and some other little parts. The story is pretty good, as it wasn't the typical romantic comedy. It was rather thrilling to watch how the story developed till the final episode. However, in the end, many things were left unanswered. Like, the romance never got to be finalized and left you thinking if they were actually attracted to each other or not. Or the murderer case, as everyone seemed fine with it. I mean, they were kind of all calm about the whole situation even from the island, where none panicked over the fact that a serial killer was among them. And there is the whole Yeol case. I'm not a fan of the idol, but I did wait to see if they found him or not, as his body was never discovered. At least, it would have been nice if there was some closure to that one.

Uncontrollably Fond certainly does not revolutionise the art in this respect, however this most certainly shouldn't discourage you, as what it does do is deliver an incredibly polished representation of the genre, from start to finish.From the beginning the stereotypical dynamics appear to immediately emerge. Bae Suzy is the classic underdog female lead, whose father is run over by the opposing female main, and lives with the weight of injustice at the hands of a corrupt social divide. Kim Woo Bin plays the handsome, rich and cocky star who has had lingering, yet vague, feelings for our beleaguered heroine since their high school days. There is also the obligatory love rival, while the aforementioned opposing female main completes the love rectangle. However, while these formulas are all too familiar, there are just enough atypical elements and twists introduced to keep the storyline fresh and engaging.. As soon as the story begins, Woo Bin's character is diagnosed with terminal cancer, and this represents the main driving force of the narrative, and the execution of this plot line throughout covers over other rehashed elements, almost seeming as if you are watching something entirely fresh and new.Of course, you are not  and there are some typical criticisms. Viewers will have to suspend their disbelief somewhat in the female lead's underdog status, given she is one of the most beautiful women in Korea, however since she naturally possesses a girl next door vibe, and they manage to compensate by downplaying her wardrobe considerably compared to the typical k drama lead  it's no big obstacle.. In fact this arguably plays into favour  her wardrobe is more realistic to the character, and adds to the down to earth effect that you really can believe would make her a unique person to the hearts of the male leads, not to mention male audience members watching. There are also some bridges to be made in certain character motivations at some points, as is again typical, but viewers willing to accept a certain degree of this is inevitable will be rewarded.The pacing of the story from the start is near perfect, and the story seamlessly transitions from phase to phase at most of the correct timings. Personally, I had a huge gripe with the pacing elements in Kim Woo Bin's previous drama hit The Heirs, as I felt the push pull love triangle phase of that story was dragged out far too long, and to the point where it grew stale and repetitive  Uncontrollably Fond has no such issues, and makes significant advances in plot, if not in every episode then certainly within  . The acting is similarly fantastic in my book  Bae Suzy was previously criticised by many for her lack of range in Architecture , yet shows off the complete spectrum here with talented subtlety. Kim Woo Bin too produces the performance of someone who has mastered their craft, especially with certain story elements that would have been difficult to execute technically as you will see.In fact, that encapsulates this production and why I was willing to give it a . We may not be breaking any ground here, but most elements ring of having been produced by people using the weight of accumulated experience to produce a well rounded and complete article. This drama knows what it is doing  Uncontrollably Fond will toy with your emotions, pulling them this way and that  having you crying one minute and grinning like an idiot the next before the tears can even dry. As the subject matter suggests, it is primarily a melodrama, and a very successful one at that. By the end you can expect to feel hollow and empty inside, with a bittersweet nostalgia to the lives of these fictional characters, as the hallmark of a k drama's job well done.So don't forget the tissues ready.", "Uncontrollably fond made me cry, I admit it (and there are very few dramas or movies that can make me sad enough to make me teary!). The story is about a girl who's dad had been killed by a hit and run and she is now struggling to pay off her dept, and a guy, who's a celebrity but used to bully her. Now the guy is dying by an incurable illness, and he wants to set things right for the girl. The first episode wasn't that good and I've even thought of giving up on the series. But the second one was great, and the drama kept going till the very last episode, keeping the interest high till the very end. The flash backs were beautifully presented and the characters' stories create a web, as they are all connected with one another. The story is quite interesting and the love story nice enough, but the main point for me wasn't the romance, but the whole justice  paid back was more entertaining. The performances were really good and helped the story to climax. So,  out .", "The most wonderful and convincing drama.

Kim Woo Bin is especially good in some very emotional sequences as he battles illness.It has that odd mix of high drama and very broad comedy so typical of Korean television and film.Our hero Shin Joon young is a hot KPop KDrama star and No Eul a tv producer wanting to do a documentary about his life. Of course they go through the normal hate you hate you love you romance with numerous plot twists and complications so typical of romantic dramedies but with the added punch that Shin Joon young is dying.Seven boxes of tissues later it is all resolved.

The very high level of self parody done well that is lauded to the hilt in western efforts like the TV series Chuck is derided unappreciatively as shallow simpering, career trademark of Jim Carrey. Most of all, the production quality, in particular the substantially superior picture resolution & camera work, gets no mention. Again & again, I've been left agape at the beauty of just the picture or scene setting or camera staging in Chinese & Korean production that is so evidently a quantum level above even the best of what I see come out of Hollywood. Much of that seems to utilize the : aspect ratio with a panoramic sensibility missing altogether in western cinema weaned on the : TV screen so cripplingly dependent on the close up of faces.

It's another poor girl meets rich boy Korean melodrama. Korean television will tell this same story over and over again until the end of time, and, lord knows I've seen a crap ton of these shows to say the least. Summary Verdict: this one's not bad.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Ha Ji won plays Gil Ra im; a poor & humble stunt woman trying to make ends meet working in the movie industry. Hyun Bin plays Kim Joo won; a wealthy & arrogant heir to an upscale department store chain. Joo won mistakes Ra im as an actress his famous brother once dated, and as a result, they subsequently meet & spend some time together by accident. Need I even bother expounding?...comedy, romance, drama ensue. You know the format: she's the pretty but tough tomboyish type with no time for nonsense in her life, he's the straight laced rich guy who works hard but has plenty of time for whatever nonsense he wishes. The two meet and he begins to soon fall for her. She's less than impressed with him though, so he's got his work cut out for him. The tried and true staple of K drama loves stories is on full display here; he's constantly presented with a series of arranged dates to meet a future wife from the same ilk as his own family, but he's not interested in this and wants to find his own love. His stature and eligibility means he pursued by an endless supply of suitable beauties, so his ego is a bit unchecked in regards to what a great catch he thinks he is. As such, he is somewhat baffled by the fact that this lower class girl doesn't jump at the chance to be with him, couldn't care less about his standing, and won't give him the time of day. He's also never met any woman quite like this before in his life, and she's pretty easy to look at, so he's more than intrigued smitten determined etc. He therefore decides to use his power and wealth to intrude in her life in order to win her over, which initially backfires of course, until perhaps the  can eventually find some common ground to stand on if this relationship was meant to be.We're rolling right along with the standard fare for this genre over the first half dozen episodes or so; it's workable and kept fairly tight for the most part as the two leads come together bit by bit. It's all pretty much par for the course, then, BAM (SPOILERS); on a mountain biking date one day, the  stray off course and stumble upon a strange old shop & restaurant in the middle of nowhere. While there, they imbibe a magical potion which causes their souls to switch bodies. As such, a whole new layer to the proceedings then comes into play in this series.While this wacky out of nowhere plot aspect of the show may seem absurd (and it is, of course), it does actually work, and, it works quite well. It both helps to break up the status quo for a typical K drama, and, also serves to further benefit the story as well as a whole. These two characters were having a hard time developing a common ground & relationship the old fashioned way, so perhaps they will find love via this mystical method instead. Accordingly, the two opposites come to understand and appreciate each other more by spending time in each other's body life.The twist provides for a great deal of comedy to be mined here, as the CEO dude now has to lead the life of the poor tough girl, and stunt woman girl has to run a company and be subjected to high society pressures. While they've switched bodies, they also each take the opportunity to investigate the other, turn away the other's potential love interests, see each other's friends and siblings half naked, etc. It's all pretty cute. This is not without problems though, as each time it rains, the bodies are switched back and forth; so, there's a chance he might get caught in her body while trying to perform a risky stunt that he's ill prepared for, or she does something unknowingly that puts him in danger due to his health problems, etc.Eventually, the two leads get down to the business of trying to figure out how to stop switching bodies all the time, so they can get back to their normal lives before somebody finds out or something goes horribly wrong. With some help from their friends and family, and with a little luck, perhaps all will work out in the end, and maybe the two leads will be able to find love along the way. The cast all put in acceptable to solid work, and just about all characters are likable enough. Perhaps the best role is that of the CEO's brother; a K pop star known as Oska, who leads a mostly carefree life of luxury when he's not lamenting the loss of his true love that got away. The stunt woman has a huge fan crush on him that comically belies her no nonsense tough girl persona, to the point of her being elated with scoring concert tickets, sleeping in Oska themed socks, etc. And, though Oska competes with his brother to some degree, he mostly serves as an intermediary for the two leads while they work on their budding romance.All in all, this show is pretty solid. It doesn't go on forever (though it could have been trimmed a little), and it's kept pretty lighthearted for the most part; it's mostly a charming comedy romance drama, with little heavy handed evil plot villain schemes. Be prepared for a melodramatic final act though, as this is Korean melodrama after all.Bottom Line:   out of  stars. I'll give it an !", "I am so happy to come across this show. I was so bored of sex, violence and drama and then, I found Secret Garden. This show gives you love in its purest form as possible. When I watch it, I can feel butterflies flying in my stomach one minute , then the tears roll down on my cheeks and a broad smile occupy my face at the end of each show. Characters are well put, funny and deep. You can feel and understand what they are going through. Story line is enhanced with side stories and never boring. The cinematography is breath taking, like most of far eastern movies the scenery brings forth the emotions. To sum up, please give this show a try, I am sure you ll be hooked :)", "I really didn't think I would like this drama. I watched Boys Over Flowers and ended up really disliking the whole series because I couldn't get over how unlikeable some of the characters were. When I started Secret Garden, I thought Oh great another story about a bratty rich guy who traumatizes his girlfriend into liking him... I bet the female lead looks like she's strong and then becomes a blubbering wimp or insensitive ice queen. I could have not been MORE WRONG. OK some may watch episode one and say...well sure looks like it to me! ...but it's not. This is how BoF should have tackled the rich boy poor girl love story.OK to be fair I was not a big Joo Won fan for most of the series (His character alone made me question the series as a whole). Surprisingly the one who enchanted me was Gil Ra Im, and the adorable Oska! < I stuck with the series because it was refreshing to see the leading lady bite back when Joo Won was being a jerk. When he hurt her she would tell him, and she never gave in to his sharp remarks, and eventually Joo Won realized the power of his own words and slowly opened himself to loving her. When you fall in love and root for a character you once disliked, that's the power of great story telling. What is more amazing about this drama, even though it followed some typical Kdrama conventions it did so in a way that you were surprised and shocked that they worked in some big revelations. It brought out the true meaning of 'destiny' and it made the series as a whole more heartfelt and touching.The switching bodies theme...I thought eeeeeeh this will be needless and over the top but it was really well done! At first it took some getting used to, but it actually made for some of the more touching moments in the story, and the funniest. Joo Won swooning over Oska made me laugh to tears. Lastly, I find one of the biggest faults with many dramas is the story always feels like it tapered off without thought at the very end. I loved that Secret Garden tied up all the loose ends in the most touching of ways. It felt complete to me, and it made me feel like the love experienced in the stories was true and sincere.Overall, those of you who watch the first couple of episodes and are not impressed, I say stick with it! You'll be glad you did. All the characters are wonderful to watch and develop into three dimensional people that you'll root for and cheer on! It's a fantastic love story that makes you want to find your soulmate. :D", "Every time I watch a show from Korea, I am never disappointed. This one is no different. An emotional roller coaster show with fantastic characters, beautiful cinematography and amazing soundtrack. You will fall in love with the show and its characters. The script is well written and the actors and actresses have such chemistry.You will find yourself laughing, crying, smiling and being angry right along with them.A word of caution though. You will find yourself wanting to start the next episode once you reach the end of the one you are watching because it is that good and addicting. I was sad that I got to the last episode and it ended. So, I started watching from the first episode again. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.", "The title head pretty much described it all, with such unique story line of modern fairy tale and the harsh reality, it was sure hardcore for everyone who watched the whole series. They have deviated from the usual KDrama style, plot and conflicts. It is fantasy by the way, but the great thing is that it was not greatly emphasized in the early episodes (the switching part). They did not spend most of the time in different bodies, in contrast to what others would have expected. Sure it was fun to watch the actors played so well but in the latter part it played a big role in story development and made the story what it is: destiny, love, magic and everything else in between.More on the deviating from usual KDrama trend, let's go to love triangles. Pretty much empty, for the first part again I expected Oska and Yoon Seul to be big third parties in the rel. of the main characters (just like in Full House) but again wasn't interesting anymore. Another thing is the conflict between Joo Won's mother. I thought it would be another main conflict but the theme of the story prevailed : Love conquers all! I would also like to commend the writer for such great plot. I love that she did not revealed everything in the first parts, opposed to many KDramas that tells the social status of both protagonists, family background and conflicts at the start of the story. If it had been like that, it would not make the story interesting (I was really guessing what could have happened to Ra Im's father, or Joo Won's life changing accident, nor how the Oska Yoon Seul bitterly ended) .It was obviously not a character driven plot, it was more on what's going to happen to Gil Ra Im and Joo Won next that would help clarify the past.There were many metaphors, symbols and recurring themes (eg little mermaid) and if you had not appreciated this series, I say you missed it. Clearly, it was a work of a genius to think of such great script and plot.Another common mistakes of Kdramas is that you would end up loving the actors because of empty reasons. Secret Garden got me so hooked up to Gil Ra Im and Joo Won that i did not bother searching their names in Google when i was watching the series (I only did that after finishing the series). Their undeniable chemistry would sure fire up the intensity of the key plots, making them effective actors. BOTTOMLINE: I fell in love with the characters! Not with the actors !The ending was absolutely perfect. It wasn't a fairy tale like ending. Ra Im did not turn into Cinderella, nor Joo Won into Prince Charming.

Ever since I became an EXO L, I heard about how bad this show is, but truly, I think it has charms. Sure, it's not one of the best dramas ever to be made, it's not a   rating all over the board and it's not winning any Oscars or awards of that calibre. However, I think there is some real charm within this. The first few episodes are definitely quite cringy, and I definitely considered dropping it after the first  , however, the middle of the series isn't too bad. If you can make it to around episode , then you can pretty much finish this off without it being too cringe. The last couple of episodes   the last one in particular   were extremely well done. I felt like there could have been more added to the storyline per se, it was all a bit give and take, I think. There was a lot where EXO could have done more with their acting, there was a lot where Gayoung could have toned down Inchul Gal a lot more as well. I don't know where the line was drawn between being way too much and way too little. This isn't to knock the acting at all, don't get me wrong   I think all actors and actresses did really well with what they were given for the show, I think the script and character writing could have just balanced it out a bit more. I keep saying this does have a bit of a cringe factor, and truth is, if the characters had been toned down a notch or toned up a notch then I think that wouldn't have occurred   this is my own personal opinion, I know quite a few people who love it how it is.This is a show that definitely has charms. When I say it has a potential rewatch factor, there are some episodes I will definitely watch again, namely the last three. I wouldn't watch the entire season again, it's too much   especially the first few episodes. The storyline was well written, but again, it all came down to the characters themselves on why I wasn't too keen on this. Incheon Gal was way too over the top; I know she was supposed to be but it did quite get on my nerves.All in all, I think at least every EXO L should give this a try. My bias list is in tatters, I laughed and cried my way through it and   surprisingly   a member of EXO doesn't die in this one! A rarity!", "A sort drama (only ten to fifteen minutes per episode) staring the boy band EXO and even though someone would expect it to be just a badly covered advertisement for the band and maybe some products as well, it surprisingly isn't. The story is nice and funny as well: four members of the band move next door to a girl's house. The girl is forced to become their cleaning lady by her mother. All the while, Chanyeol is trying to find a locket that his grandfather had left to change his bad luck and D.O. falls for her. Okay, the main thing that bothered me was the girl's face. When she liked a guy or got embarrassed it turned red...well more like hot pink alien like. That was simply too weird and silly. Plus, the locket thing was really silly as well. But you can't expect much from a drama like this one, so you should just overlook those faults and just enjoy the drama. And sure enough, it is a funny drama and it can be watched from a non fan as well as fans (I'm not a fan and I enjoyed it and my friend who's an exo L also liked it so I think it goes both ways...). Plus, the romance was good, with the love triangle nice enough, and the band drama was convincing enough.

I was pretty much blown away by this series, why? Firstly acting here is superb, Ji Sung (or Ji Seong) in main role plays orphan who wants to make his way up from scum to success and live a better life. I can't understand why isn't he amazingly popular actor already, his acting was really convincing and he is also good looking fellow, which probably ain't bad thing when it comes to becoming popular either. Also gotta mention Sung Yu Ri (or Seong Yoo ri), who also makes marvelous role here as a girl with a dream and is just damn beautiful too. Rest of the cast also does great job, if I'd had to mention someone else besides ones above, it gotta be Jun Kwang Ryul (or Jeon Gwang Ryeol), who makes great role as bitter and heartless old man. As story goes on motives and ambitions of characters change, so it isn't just some simple story about thug who isn't happy with his life and wants money and success.Secondly plot is really nice and complex and there's some action in it too, it's really not basic romance drama. Thirdly Characters are also likable, drama really kept me interested all ~ hours and music played in drama are also just brilliant. TRAX + Air really has made awesome job with two of their songs that played during series. So why not   then?

Words cannot describe how impressed I am towards this Korean historical drama. The reason why I did not rate this drama as a perfect , is because it has a rushed and messy ending. However, I am still incredibly amazed and blown away by this drama. The drama is based on a novel of the same title, which centers around the life of real life historical painter Shin Yun Bok(portrayed by Moon Geun Young). There is a twist in the novel drama: Shin Yun Bok is actually a girl in disguise as a boy in order to enter the Royal Painting bureau. Moon Geun Young has done an impeccable job in portraying SYB. If I had not known that Moon Geun Young is actually an actress, I would have mistaken her for an actor!!!!! Her acting is top notch; she delivered every speech and action perfectly. She gave the character SYB life and the character remains alive in my heart even until now. Therefore, Moon Geun Young has become one of my favorite actresses in no time. The chemistry between the cast is good, however, I reckon that Moon Geun Young and actress Moon Chae Won(who portrayed Jeong Hyang) had the BEST chemistry in the drama. Being confused with her sexuality, Shin Yun Bok fell in love with the musically gifted Gisaeng Jeong  Hyang. Whenever both characters appear on screen together, their intense chemistry is apparent. When both characters have eye contact, it is as if a thousand sparks had exchanged between their eyes. Their interactions were incredibly precious and unique. I had hoped that they would have more interactions in the drama. Besides the acting, the cinematography and writing are fantastic. The writer, together with the director, masterfully incorporated the famous paintings of painter Shin Yun Bok into the plot. The paintings came to life, literally. Being a lover of paintings, I am absolutely in love with how paintings were woven into the storyline of the drama and how the paintings were drawn from scratch(professional painters were hired in the drama to replicate the paintings). I am incredibly mind blown by the beautiful cinematography skills. The plot is very exciting and I had to watch episodes back to back. The plot twists never failed to surprise me, leaving me in a state of awe and disbelief. There were some awesome scenes which were unique to the drama, which I adored greatly. I found the drama very heartwarming, some parts were heartbreaking, even. Ah, the amazing and lovely soundtracks that were played throughout the drama had complemented every scene perfectly. I was hugely impacted by the songs and I adore them immensely. I could not stop humming the songs to myself even after completing the drama. Memories of the drama never fail to flood back into my mind whenever I hear the soundtracks, leaving me feeling poignant. The soundtracks of Painter of the Wind remain as one of my favorite Korean drama soundtracks. Therefore, Painter of the Wind is an enjoyable drama to watch. It showcases many aspects of the Arts as well as relationships between people. The drama is just BEAUTIFUL."], "Sentiment Score": 1.0}, "435": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "214": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "560": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "216": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "956": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "781": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["The South Korean show Vampire Prosecutor is definitely odd. In many ways, it reminds me of the TV shows Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, CSI as well as Hannibal! The show has an ensemble cast that investigate murders and it's led by Min Tae yeon\u2014a prosecutor AND vampire! I have no idea if lawyers actually investigate cases line Min in South Korea, but he certainly does. When he visits the crime scenes he's able to smell or taste the blood and see in his mind how the murders occurred\u2014a bit like how Will is able to channel the murders on Hannibal. In addition to him, the team is also made up of three others\u2014the detective Hwang Soon bum, rookie prosecutor Yoo Jung in and an intern, Choi Dong  man. These folks are a nice addition and the ensemble cast reminds me so much of the Law & Order franchise\u2014as does the way the cases are investigated and prosecuted. And, the heavy use of forensics in the show is like seeing an installment of CSI.Now you'd THINK that the show might be a bit like Twilight or Dracula but it's really like neither. This vampire does NOT sleep in coffins nor does he attack folks nor does he avoid the daylight like 'ol Drac but he also is NOT a sparkly, angst ridden guy \u00e0 la Twilight! He's unique and quite professional\u2014a lawyer through and through. Plus, now that I think about it, how different are vampires from lawyers anyways? They both are blood suckers!If all this isn't enough, the show is very well made. It's incredibly stylish, well written and kept my interest.

But even in the portrayal of the story we see elements we don't often see in Kdramas; little things like consistently appropriate music, superior lighting for the scenery that makes it look higher production, and a very cool opening title sequence (not that they're usually boring, but they aren't often this cool). Perhaps most unusual was a lack of love story subplots.If you liked Vampire Prosecutor and appreciated these elements, you'll like Vampire Prosecutor . Only six episodes have aired so far and we see *SPOILER* that a love story might brew up after all *END SPOILER* but I'm very much okay with that. Just do it well and I'll eat it up.In all, it has few flaws and again I have to throw in the word unique to describe it. Tired of typical crime mystery dramas?

Cause maybe the first few minutes I started focusing on how horrible the camera man was. The scenes had too many close ups, it changed scenes like every five minutes, and the camera couldn't hold still. So I stopped watching it until I caught my friend watching it and so she told me to watch it instead since she was going to take a shower, (I couldn't find the remote to click it off) So I ended up watching it, only this time I focused more on the plot. By the end of episode , I was hooked. Deeply. The plot was very well made! The main character Min Tae Yeon, was very well made, as well were other characters' descriptions. Unfortunately, there were times when the acting was a bit of a cringe, but the well made plot made it disappeared. The main female lead... I didn't like her personality tbh. She was rude when it was unnecessary and she seemed really nosy in others businesses when she tells others not to get in her own. Her character was very smart, I'll give her that. Although, I thought she had a bit of a reason to behave the way she did, but that shouldn't mean to be rude when uncalled for. The nd male lead, his character was funny because he was a bit of a mess, but that has never stopped him. In fact, sometimes he used it to his advantage. He was actually trustworthy and very useful at times. And just to make him more human, he was a bit of a pervert. But more like a common guy liking women alot in that way. Sadly, he doesn't get anyone. The rd male lead is my second favorite next to the main character.

Such a pitiful excuse.So, what started as let just watch this because I don't have anything else to watch turn into a binge watching show time. I finish the  seasons in  days. What fair Vampire Prosecutor from other vampire storyline is that it is Asian flavored. Instead of diving into a whole lot of historical existence, the story go its own way.Since every episode deal with a different case, the story managed to be different every time.

This cotton candy show features an amusing foursome that have been friends since high school.

When the show focused on their friendship, it delivered with upfront and sometimes amusing slices of issues of the modern man. The show had charm, and the actors were willing to look silly when the script called for it. Each episode began with a shared experience from their past as friends. It was amusing watching these  something actors pretend to be in high school in some of these flashbacks.Our four friends:a. Do jin was a confidence character that was surprised by love and love that he had to work to earn as his lady of choice initially cared about another of the foursome. There was a great romantic moment when he gave the woman he loved a fabulous pair of shoes and told her to wear them when she was ready to accept him and his love.b. Tae san was the chauvinist, dominating guy who bossed around his sister and lady love but had a sweet side too. His willingness to accept his feisty lady love's priority of her career over marriage showed he did want her happiness.c. Choi Yoon played by Kim Min jong was the widower that was hotly pursued by Tae san's sister  years his junior. His unwillingness to engage in romance with her is understandable though he eventually decides he is ready for love.d. Jung rok was the fluff character of the bunch. Spoiled, womanizing, but with charm and love for his wife. Getting her to believe that he loved her and would stop his womanizing ways was a tough sell.I was less enamored of the women in their lives:. Yi soo was a high school teacher that loved her students and was honest and forthright. She took her time falling for Do jin. I felt the actress over acted sometimes but it was consistent throughout the series, perhaps she was directed to deliver that performance. The character's acceptance of his surprise son from a youthful relationship was good, though this was not horrible in my mind but it was portrayed as a negative and shameful.. Se ra was prickly, viewed other women as rivals not friends, and focused on her golfing career. Initially this character was off putting but grew on me throughout the series.. Min sook was the brittle, tough wife of Jung rok who was mistrustful of her husband due to his past dalliances. This character was tough but caring. I was a fan of this character at the end of the series.. Meari was difficult to watch. Over emoting, tons of ugly crying, and no character growth at all.

The show revolves around the inner workings of pharmaceutical conglomerate and the people working within it.SPOILERS AHEAD!This show has all your usual story lines that come with these melodramas, but, it gets off to a bit of an unusually odd and lighthearted start. A good portion of the first half dozen episodes or so are handled with a good bit of comedic touch, sometimes hysterically so. It seems to almost border on being more of a parody at times, and I really was digging the fact this show was perfectly willing to not to take itself too seriously. From the off the wall show trailers & previews, to the theme music utilized, to the crazy homage's to other films & shows that seemingly come out of nowhere. It all makes for quite an amusing intro. Your basic story finds our young hero, played by Lee Boem Soo (Lifting King Kong, Over My Dead Body), doing whatever he needs to raise money to provide for his sickly mother. He plays the earnest everyman who volunteers to enter an anti aging clinical drug trial program as a test subject in order to earn some quick cash. He soon gets swept up in series of schemes presented to him that eventually leads to him work for the company that produces the drug he's the guinea pig for. While there, he meets the female lead; the outrageously obnoxious & bitchy granddaughter of the company president, played by Jung Ryeo Won (Castaway on the Moon). She's terrific as the entitled, high maintenance, heiress who curses like a drunken sailor and leaves a trail of chaos in her wake with anyone and anything she encounters.Our two main leads, who are polar opposites, get thrown together as a result of various circumstances. They bond, and she comes to have more respect & understanding for how things work in the real world.Your other two young leads are played by Hong Soo Hyun and Jung Gyu Woon. The former is the lead research scientist turned secretary for the company, and, she is your resident gorgeous babe on the show; if scientists actually looked like her in real life, I would have majored in the subject. The latter is your obligatory KTV hunk that plays the up and coming corporate ladder climber with a hidden agenda. Both of them do a nice job in their roles, and together, they provide for a good bit of the comedic undertone that runs throughout the show.These  young protagonists are brought together time and again under various personal and business relationships. From there, it's just a matter of time to see who will be with whom, what happens to the company, who's good and who's not, etc. In the meantime, the rest of the cast is busy plotting, undermining, and backstabbing each other via increasingly preposterous means.Everything is moving along swimmingly from the start, then, this show slowly & surely starts to move away from what made it pretty enjoyable to begin with. What started off as a unique and interesting balance between humor and drama, soon became nothing more than a standard heavy dose of KTV melodrama fare! Eventually, the melodramatic back & forth stories become more and more ludicrous as the series progresses until it all just about spins out of control. It's a shame really!This show is not awful, and there are several things to like here, but I can't help but think this was a wasted opportunity to be so much more than it was. I feel it would have been far better served if it stuck to its somewhat clever initial tone throughout the entire series. Bottom Line:  out of  stars! Not without merits, and I liked a bunch of its parts, but the sum of its parts is lacking overall IMO. Ultimately, it just falls in step with so many other familiar premises that I've seen over and over again in this genre, and, it doesn't do this all that well either. Also, the BIG FINALE was as an absurd and anti climatic an ending as I've ever seen.Watchable, but, feel free to skip it if you have other stuff to check out on the horizon that you feel is more promising."], "Sentiment Score": 1.0}, "1261": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["A true heartfelt comedy. We see a connection between a mentally ill father and his lovingly adorable daughter. A really close one. Although mentally unfit, the emotion and love of the father is undeniable.

Behind that, there is a tragically engaging story    The kind hearted father, as innocent as he is, accused of murder and rape. The prison scenes act as an icing to the story. A place so feared and somber, is in fact where most of the comedy takes place. It shows the positive side of a prison life, and that not all prisoners are gangsters or bad. Everyone has a heart, a good one that is. They have made their prison cell a very bearable place. So much that even Ye Seung, the daughter can hide in it and stay with them.All characters play very important roles to construct the whole movie. It's fun to watch the prison inmates, all having their very own personality. Ryoo Seung Yong portrayed the character of the mentally handicapped father very convincingly. And the child actor, Kal So Won is so cute and sweet and suited her role so much. Even the adult version of the girl turns out to be a real sweetheart and has a very captivating performance. The movie shows us that you can be someone as high up as a Police Commissioner, but a disgusting personality. Or someone as simple minded as the father in this story, but with a good heart. Rankings and positions really does not determine a person. Sometimes things are more delightful when it's not complicated, as long as we know to appreciate and cherish all that we have.This is definitely one of the best Korean movies.

A mentally disabled man is torn apart from his little daughter as he is wrongfully accused of a unspeakable crime. He is mistreated by police and prison authorities. In jail he is bullied. But slowly he changes the mind of people around him and hatred turns into care. His daughter is smuggled into the prison and it is there father and daughter can meet again. Comic and enjoyable moments take place within the prison walls. The scenes alternate between being very serious and being comic. Both part is very well done. Its is pulled off by excellent acting. Ye sung is adorable and acting is outstanding for her age. Yong gu is the child like father whose only concern is welbeing of Ye sung.The movie is not flawless. If you really want to, you really can find some of the events and story illogical or impractical. For example how can he be allowed to be the guardian of this daughter in the st place? Surely he is not mature enough to raise a child but it seems neighbors, welfare or school must not be ignorant about it.I found similarity with the movies Life is Beautiful and Green Mile. Life is Beautiful was a story about a child like father and his son and was a comedy set on a very depressing world. In Green Mile the prisoner has a child like innocence and wins the trust of all the guards. Usually I don't think it is good idea to mix up very polarized genres. Particularly I don't think its a good idea to mix up something very depressing and dark with comedy. Comedy best works standalone or when mixed with Action or Romance. Hence the genres rom com or action comedy. I think when you are watching something depressing and when you are presented with a comic moment its not natural to immediately switch to a laughter mode, and the scene is wasted, and hence its not a great idea to do it in the st place.

One look at those soft, ideally feminine Asian facial features and one moment of listening to her alluring female voice was all it took to melt me. I'm glad that one of the local Korean language cable TV channels here in my part of the Eastern United States decided to broadcast this series, for I may never have discovered her otherwise. The drama itself is probably average or somewhat above average    it revolves around a love triangle involving Shim Hye won (Miss Son), a young woman who received a heart transplant and who struggles to emerge out of a sickly childhood to live a normal life and experience the normal range of human experiences and emotions, such as true love. Someone get the tissue boxes ready, 'cause tears are gonna be a flowin' on both sides of the screen.What may set this drama apart is the beautiful rustic South Korean scenery in which some key scenes are set and the wide range of stunning appearances that Son Ye jin adopts throughout this drama. She's a pretty and energetic schoolgirl one minute, a sweet young maiden in conservative dress wandering in the woods the next, and a darling bride to be at yet another instance. The combination of breathtaking natural scenery and youthful smashing girl can indeed be a potent and poignant one from a cinematographic point of view. The musical score of the series is somewhat impressive, I must say, and merges harmoniously with the theme of the drama and the scenes in which the music is played. Even when the action in the series becomes dull, redundant, and excessively emotional, the mere chance to gaze at Miss Son washes away all other concerns about the drama.

After her recovery, her personality begins to change, and she develops a passion for life and an optimism that was denied her prior to the operation. She is involved with a young man, Jung jae, who has been her sweetheart since high school, and things are looking good for her.A young man, Min woo, loses the love of his life, Eun hye, in a car accident on what appears to be his wedding day. Unable to get over her, he leaves the country to study architecture in Italy. A couple of years later, he returns to Seoul to try and pick up the threads of his life.Fate intervenes. The two have a chance meeting on a nearby island when Hye won, there to photograph wild flowers (she is a florist) is injured in a fall, and Min woo hears her calls for help. Because she cannot walk properly, the two end up stranded there by approaching night and bad weather. They are forced to spend the night in a hut. They find they have a lot in common, a situation further exacerbated by the fact that Hye won is strikingly similar to his dead girlfriend, from the words she uses when speaking, to her tastes and even the thoughts she expresses. Min woo is both freaked out by and drawn to her. Hye won in turn feels her heart beat painfully just by being near him.You can just about guess the rest. Of course, they fall in love. And of course, Hye won's donor turns out to be Eun hye. Therein lies the drama: neither party knows the history of the other, but it is discovered bit by bit, and exploited and used as leverage by Jung jae, and also Jung jae's sister, who has a wild and unreciprocated crush on Min woo.Several themes are explored. And explored. And explored. To whit: Is the change in Hye won's personality the result of her having a new lease on life after the transplant, or is it because she has taken on the traits of the donor? Does Min woo love her for herself, or because she reminds him so much of someone he loved and lost? Does she, Hye won, love him, or is it Eun hye loving him through her, and she's just the body? Is her will her own, and does she even have a 'self' any more? And what of the long time boyfriend who wants to marry her and will not give her up no matter what? And the sister who schemes to break them up? Stretched over twenty episodes, it becomes at times woefully repetitive. Supporting characters have little more to do than eat, connive and advance the plot. So why watch it? Two reasons: Son Ye jin as Shim Hye won, and Song Seung heon as Yoo Min woo. They are a match made in TV drama heaven. She is meltingly lovely and he is impossibly handsome. They bring a surprising depth to characters that could've been unbearable in lesser hands. Watching Song Seung heon's eyes run the gamut from disbelief to fear to unbearable longing as he hears Hye won speaking words he has heard before but coming from a different mouth, is a marvel of subtlety and beauty.

There's really no other way to describe it.If you've spent some time watching Korean television (as I have), you know their dramas tend to be overly melodramatic; that's OK if you don't lay it on too thick, however this series takes the melodrama factor to a level of absurdity I've rarely ever seen. The only reason I kept watching this train wreck is because the ludicrous story line and plot twists are just unbelievably hilarious.SPOILERS AHEAD!This show revolves around an orphaned boy who grows up seeking vengeance on the men who murdered his parents. While growing up, he becomes super rich and super skilled at all methods of mortal combat in order to get the revenge he deserves. As an adult, he goes by  different names; let's just call him 'God' shall we. He's supposed to be the super suave and smart man that can do no wrong, has it all, makes all the ladies swoon, etc. The only problem with this is the guy that plays him (don't know what his name is and don't care), well, he sucks as an actor (at least based on this show). He's supposed to be the strong and silent type of leading man, but instead comes across as a dim witted lunatic who often can't form complete sentences.God is also a legendary international assassin. How he has time to do this, while plotting revenge, training in deadly arts, pleasing the ladies, and running a billion dollar corporation, is beyond me, particularly so when it's obvious he spends most of his time styling his ridiculous hairdos. And, what is the international code name of this legendary killer? Of course, it's Peter Pan!...Brilliant!...I would have been reluctantly OK with this if it were just a throw away nickname, but, everybody in this series references it constantly'God' is Peter Pan?...Peter Pan is coming to get me?...Peter Pan is doing what?, etc. It's simultaneously irritating and comical.The rest of the plot is an absolute mess; there are  girls in love with 'God' (despite the fact that he's a douche and a mass murderer with a severe multiple personality disorder). One of these girls is first loyal to 'God', then disloyal, then repeat. The second girl is irrelevant to the plot and is purely there for eye candy (she does have really nice legs though). The third girl is some wide eyed reporter who gets in the way of the revenge plot, and becomes the main love interest throughout this show; her and 'God somehow fall in love (which is absurd because they have absolutely nothing in common and zero chemistry). Her character is as dumb as a rock, and became more useless and annoying as this series dragged on.The best storyline involves the girl who wants to catch 'God'. She's a detective that was raised by a single father. Unbeknownst to her, she's also adopted, and is 'God's' younger sister. Her father was actually the henchman who worked for the dudes that murdered 'God's' parents years ago. The father was supposed to kill 'God's' entire family, but decided to save young 'God', and his sister, at the last second. Young 'God' was sent to an orphanage, and the father took 'God's' sister to replace his own dying daughter. 'God's' sister (who 'God' thought was dead), eventually grows up to be the detective who's hunting 'God'. The father considers revealing the truth years later, but he can't cause the main dude hunting 'God' glued his lips shut, killed him, and framed 'God' for the murder, so the detective ('God's' sister) would hunt and kill 'God'.This detective sister plot is absurd enough as it is, but why stop there?...The illegitimate daughter of one of the evil dudes 'God' is chasing happens to be the same dingbat reporter that 'God' loves, which technically makes the eye candy girl her biological sister. The main dude hunting 'God' (it should be noted that he's an even worse actor than the lead character, if that's possible) is the son of one of the other evil dudes who's bound to a wheelchair, and he also happens to be in love with the reporter. The brother of the eye candy girl is in love with loyal disloyal girl, who's still in love with 'God', etc. This type of nonsense literally never ends!This show is breathtakingly out of control. I'm continually amazed at how many outrageous things this show can come up with; need a contract killer of the week?...bring in the guy that fights with a whip and poisonous add on nails, or the Geisha ninja, or the secretary self defense expert, or Pascal from Vegas (don't ask). Need the main love interest to reminisce about being with 'God'?...let's film her longingly looking at still production photos during their happy times together (nobody will notice that she couldn't possibly have these photos unless they were actually provided to her by the production team). Also, every main character involved with this show has endless chances to easily accomplish their goals, but they can't because they over complicate everything, make really bad decisions, and are just too stupid in general. And, on and on it goes! This show is so bad that I wouldn't have been surprised if the wheelchair bound dude stood up at some point to prance around a board meeting like a deranged Jiminy Cricket...Oh wait, that actually happens!Bottom Line: this show is unbelievably BAD! But, it's almost worth watching to see how bad it is. Almost! On a scale of  to , it gets  point to start with (because everything is worth something),  point for the abundant pretty ladies, and  point for the comically unintentional absurdity of it all.

The fights, reasoning, effects, etc. are a little low when compared with Western dramas. And, I did have to get past the braided mullet that the protagonist wears for most of the show, maybe a thing in Korea in ?I thought the ending was weak, which is very common for Asian dramas. Poor endings make it look like the writers and cast were suddenly told they had one episode left to wrap everything up with half the normal budget. Often, there is never a denouement following the climax.Overall I enjoyed it more than most Asian dramas, which I generally find a slow moving.

With minimal resources and no clue what they're doing, they have little chance to succeed, but with a lot of fighting spirit and some good fortune, perhaps they can pull it off (and thus, pay off their debts, save the company, realize their dreams, etc).Full disclosure: I wasn't really planning on watching this show. But, as I often do, I'll give just about any KTV show I can a quick courtesy test look by checking out an episode or two. If it appears to be any good or something I might like, I'll either keep viewing until it stinks or until I've seen too many episodes to not go ahead and finish it out. This particular show did appeal to me fairly quickly, so I stuck with it to the end.Before going any further, let's get one thing out of the way right off the bat: If you're looking for a K drama for no other reason than its jammed packed full of pretty young Korean girls, than this is the show for you! One would figure there would have to be at least a few cuties on hand since it's a story about winning a beauty pageant, but, there's probably a good  of 'em or so available at any given moment (and they are frequently put to use). This doesn't get racy or overly exhibitionist per se; the story takes place in  Korea (so, it's fairly tame by today's standards), however, there is a clear and consistent effort to get these girls on screen whenever possible.Looking past all the hotties running around in bathing suits and the like, there's a decent underdog drama story to be had here. The primary players are all down on their luck and they need to figure out how to simply survive while trying to maintain their dignity as best as possible. They have a lot of individual differences and personal agendas, but they eventually start bonding little by little. Standing in the way of them is a host of slime ball investor boss politician types, some gangsters, and a bevy of backstabbing bitches.The titular Miss Korea is played by Lee Yeon hee; I've seen her in several previous projects, and while certainly attractive, she's yet to impress me with her acting ability. She really deserves some credit for her performance here though. Whether this is just the result that comes from her own experiences & maturity, a perfectly suitable role, the light switch finally going on, hard work, or whatever, she's quite effective and impressive throughout this show.There's a bit of late ''s nostalgia involved with this show (some occasional big hair, gigantic computer monitors, songs from that era, etc...), but it could otherwise easily be mistaken for a drama that takes place in the present day. I'd even argue that this show's theme is just as relevant now as it was back in '; there's a significant focus on just trying to make a living during a crappy global economy, along with the enormous amount of pressure & sacrifices relating to succeeding within any form of the Korean entertainment industry. There's also the semi historical rehash of IMF support for that era, along with the introduction of the legendary BB cream, etc. This all serves to benefit & augment the primary story fairly well.One of the better aspects of this show is its eclectic group of supporting characters and how they're dealt with; these characters are focused on as needed and many of them shine when called upon. The elevator girl's uncle, father, and extended family have their infrequent moments, and, the actress who portrays the Godmother of the Miss Korea pageant gives a mesmerizing performance in an important side role. The budding relationship between the aging gangster and cosmetic scientist really takes the cake though; it's such an oddly awkward romance that is really hard not to like in the long run.If this show has one fatal flaw, it's this: Where is the eye candy for the female viewers?...A typical K drama will usually have a fairly equal mix of attractive male & female cast members (i.e. for every super sexy Woman, there is usually a smoking hot Man, and for every cute young Girl, there is usually a pretty flower Boy, and so on). Not here though; this is the most disproportionate Korean show I've ever seen in regards to the F M attractiveness ratio. Lee Sun kyun is your male lead and he's good looking, but his role calls for him to primarily portray a desperate guy with a consistently pained & nervous demeanor (thus reducing his attractiveness ratio). There's a tall investor type dude who also likes elevator girl, but he's not utilized much and is more of a side character than a romantic interest.

Finished watching it last night and I am still reeling from the depth of the show. The detail they went into, how much they inter weaved the plot was nothing short of masterful.The more I think about the show the more I realised just how well they did everything. For example most of the characters are introduced negatively, there is always something about them to give you reason to either hate or look down on them slightly. Such as the main character starting out by always being sick and feeling pathetic but with every one of them they make them feel human. They grow on you to change into what feels like people you can understand and its done so insanely well.

I guess if you don't speak korean, the only chance you'll have to see this film is to grab a Koreanair flight... Unfortunately ! If recently in France, Asian cinema is getting stronger, it is more the japanese and chinese HK Taiwanese cinema that are getting the lion's share. Nothing much for the korean... It is the story about a guy who became partially amnesiac after a car accident. No big deal (except some embarassing gaffes) but he makes strange dreams about a girl he loved and whom he doesn't remember. His doctor tells him that this is a way for the memory to reconstruct itself, it means that this is an important fact, and that he should try to remember it. So our hero, who's weather man on TV, starts an investigation : who was that girl (whose face we don't see of course). So the movie is about this investigation. The guy is reconstructing his past, his college's years, but since he was kind of a secret guy, his pals, guys and girls, never knew whom he was really in love with... Obsessed with finding the girl he once loved to reconstruct his memory, he starts to see things differently at work and he doesn't notice he's slowly but surely falling in love again with a real girl, not a dream. And when he does notice that, he wants to give up his quest because that mystery girl doesn't mean anything anymore. Will he be able to embark in a new story and finding out why and by whom he was so obsessed in his past ?... As you guessed, it is a nice little romantic movie, but so far from the Meg Ryan's... Everything is done subtly and you enjoy being carried away in that story because it doesn't explain things like you're  and not knowing anything about human relationships. And people do not act like they are stupid teenagers who don't dare giving a kiss... It is not corny mainly because most of the movie is about reconstructing a past love just to know the ID of that girl, nothing more. And the present love slowly emerges from that, and when we become aware of that, other problems rise... Overall, if it is not very surprising (still a little bit), it is still very pleasant because the way it is done and very charming mostly because of the actors I must admit. Charming enough to fight the sleepiness caused by the jetlag... How many movies can do that for you ?", "This movie is adorable! I normally wouldn't see a Korean film since I don't understand Korean.BUT a friend showed this to me and I loved it!!! It is such a cute love story, sort of like a Korean Sleepless In Seattle or While you are Sleeping. It is a story of a man who loses some of his memory and tries to piece it all together. While this is happening, there are flashbacks to the past. It is very intricate and you want to immediately watch it again after the first time just to see all the clues you missed in the first time. I'm normally NOT attracted to Asian men BUT the leading man gets MORE AND MORE adorable as the movie continues.The only reason I didn't give it a  is because nothing is perfect.", "Very interesting movie about a weatherman who is slowly regaining bits and pieces of his memory after an accident, and the pieces are leading him on a quest to find a college sweetheart known only by him as Rainbow. But he just cannot remember who Rainbow is. He was always secretive in school, so none of his college friends know the lady's identity. This is a mystery romance, well acted and well made. The rainbow mystery in a way reminds of the rosebud mystery in the movie Citizen Kane. (This review is in regard to the dvd version with English subtitles.) The Korean film industry has another winner in Over The Rainbow.", "This is one of those films that leave you with a pleasant feeling inside. It is a mystery and love story all in one. The way the film unfolds is so delightful. You find yourself wondering and hoping at the same time. There is nothing dramatic in the story, but the drama nevertheless is there... in the ordinary unfolding of daily life.The two actors play their parts well. It is easy to act dramatic parts dramatically, but it is very difficult to bring out drama in everyday events in life. The actors succeed in bringing out the drama through the course of things that we do every day and yet take for granted.

At the time, it was a bit refreshing for a K drama, both for its unusual premise and excellent incorporation of manga drawings and anime scenes throughout the series.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Hana is a talented but reclusive Japanese manga artist who takes an interest in the lives of an elderly neighbor lady and the elderly gentleman who hand sweeps the street outside her home every morning at  am. One day, the gentleman passes away, and Hana's family is tasked by the community to take care of his estate and remains since he has no family. The lady soon shows up however to abscond with the ashes of the gentleman who forever swept her street. Fascinated by these  people, Hana sets off to find out more about their relationship. During her journey, she uncovers a  year love story between the lady and gentleman. She then tries to tell their love story in the form of her new manga series with the help of some other characters that show up along the way.This series started off exceptionally well, and, I was quickly taken in by its subtle and unique method of storytelling. Unfortunately, it hits a wall HARD during the middle to latter half of its run time, as it falls back on so many tired clich\u00e9 driven subplots and typical overly forced melodrama. I really wanted to skull punch the people in charge for practically ruining it all. I sometimes wish I had some all encompassing authority or magical ability to edit these shows as I see fit before they air; this is absurd of course, and, I do realize the nature of, and time constraints involved with, airing KTV shows which must fulfill a certain number of predetermined episodes. I'm rambling on here, but the basic problem with this show is that it is an excellent story that is stretched out way longer than it should be.There is a lot to like about this series though: The epic love story mystery at the core is interesting, and the efforts of Hana and her cohorts to bring this story to life while dealing with their own love interests and problems along the way is often entertaining. Also, the drawings and animation utilized throughout the series are superbly implemented, and, the  main leads stars are all quite good actors actresses. I really liked the soundtrack too; the title song and the dramatically cued love song are both still stuck in my head after all these years, and that's saying something! I also did very much like the final episode and how the series ended overall.The main problem with this series is that it's simply too long. As a result, the forced melodramatic nonsense gets out of hand as the series progresses, before it finally gets back on track. All of the characters are quite likable to begin with, but their melodramatic de evolution makes you end up not wanting to like any of them. Here's a breakdown of the  main characters:. Hana. She's shy, introverted, and doesn't like people or believe in love. She avoids interacting with the world and finds solace only in her drawings. She supposed to slowly start to emerge from her shell as the series progresses, and she does, but she also spends a lot of time just being cold and sullen, before the show finds its footing again.. Hana's love interest. This guy is a handsome young resourceful dude who has a knack for storytelling and interacting with people. He helps Hana come out of her shell as they both work towards completing the new manga, and, they begin to fall in love with each other along the way. Unfortunately, he also spends a good number of episodes throwing violent temper tantrums and whining a lot. At one point, he literally spends   full episodes as a drunkard who does nothing but cry nonstop.. The doctor psychiatrist. He's a very successful and good looking MD, and a highly reasonable man. He happens to be a huge closet manga fan, and, he possesses a gigantic stash of same that's hidden in an awesome secret room which he escapes to in order to relax with his hobby. He's a big fan of Hana's work as well, and, he soon becomes smitten with her when they meet face to face due to a series of events. His love for Hana is clearly misplaced, which would be OK if he didn't end up coming across as more of an obsessed and creepy stalker more than anything else. . The woman who produces the manga series (probably my favorite character). She's an attractive single woman that is focused on her career as an independent producer. She's hard working, and very good at what she does, and she's a perfect match for the doc referenced above that she has a crush on. It's perfectly clear that she and the doc should be together, but he's obsessed with Hana at this point, and there's no reasoning with him. So, she reacts accordingly and spends a lot of time just being a manipulative woman who pulls whatever strings she needs to in order to get what she wants (both professionally and personally).This synthetic melodrama really drives me crazy! Why are the writers and director intentionally trying to make us hate these characters?...NEWS FLASH: This does not make the show any better or more watchable, and it actually does the exact opposite. I'm perfectly fine if the melodrama flows naturally, but if not, DON'T FORCE IT! You've practically ruined what could have been an excellent show because of your mistaken belief that more melodrama ALWAYS equals better series. IT DOES NOT!If you're going to watch this show, I recommend skipping over episodes   or thereabouts; you'll be glad if you do.So, . . out of  stars.

Not that the actor did a bad job with his performance. But the character was only presented as a man who hated his currant condition and was in love with the leading lady. So, that and the ending too. Too many stories were left open, questions were left unaswered and the final scene wasn't satisfying."], "Sentiment Score": 0.98}, "1252": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "4": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1033": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "473": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "309": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "364": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "573": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1275": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "633": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["Bride of the Century aka Hundred Year Bride is a episode KTV drama from early . It was billed as a fantasy romance melodrama with a supposed horror element to it. It is not very good, mainly because it's too generic (despite its supernatural theme) and it's too hard to overlook its oft incoherent storytelling.SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: A generational curse haunts a family where the eldest son's first wife will be killed on their wedding night. This family is rich, and another family wants to marry their daughter into it to consolidate their power base, however they too know about the curse. The daughter to be married off doesn't want to die, so her mom and her concoct a plan to find an identical looking woman to pretend to be the first wife so she'll get killed instead, and thus the original daughter and mom can swoop in and marry into the money & power they seek.The girl they get to play the stand in to the bride to be looks exactly the same, but the  girls are total opposites in personality. Forget all the supernatural stuff; this show is the same story these K dramas tell all the time, i.e. poor girl meets rich guy, rich guy can't stand her at first, poor girl eventually wins everybody over with her kindness and spirit, rich guy falls for poor girl, they're in love but can't be together, rich guy sulks, poor girl cries, everything works out in the end because they were fated to be together. It's an endlessly rehashed tale that only works well if you put some actual thought into the story and writing, and this show does neither of those things very well.This story is also severely lacking in any creativity...Dual secondary love interests?: Check! A half dozen characters faint or have heart attacks at some point?: Check! Rich manipulative evil people?: Check! Everything is destiny?: Check! Everybody's family is endlessly intertwined with everybody else's?..Check! Check! Check! I've seen it all a hundred times before, and seen it done better many, many times. The supernatural aspect really adds nothing to this show of any benefit. In fact (SPOILERS), there is no family curse at all, but nobody knows this at first. There is a ghost though, who wants revenge or peace and or something depending on the daily script re writes. As for the overall storytelling and writing, it's hard to forgive the numerous instances of how nonsensical it is at times. I can accept many flaws in logic with fantasy themed K dramas, but I have to draw the line somewhere. Consider these simple questions that pretty much make the writers look like fools should anyone bother to ask them:) Why doesn't the one family just move out of the haunted house? ) Why doesn't the bride to be just simply not marry into the cursed family? ) How does the mom and daughter plan to pull this charade off when there will be an identical dead body leftover to deal with?...What about marriage license, ID's, fingerprints, the fact that they've committed conspiracy and fraud, etc? The show either tries to answer these questions (and others like them) with only basic curt explanations which make little to no sense, or it doesn't even bother trying to answer them at all. There are gaping plot holes everywhere, and none of the writers seem to even care. There is no effort spent in explaining why the poor girl would even fall for the rich guy; he's basically an ass towards her, then all of sudden she's in love with him so much that she's willing to die just to be with him for one night? Really? And, in the writers' haste to give everyone the growth and resolution treatment at the end of the show, they seem to have conveniently forgotten the fact that several of these characters were perfectly willing to kill our heroine on several occasions. What are they thinking trying to generate any pathos for these characters ? The writing and storytelling is so illogical that it's utterly laughable at times.Obviously, I don't have a whole lot of positive things to say about this show. I will however say that it's shot and produced well, and it smartly keeps to a minimum run time. I did mostly like the  leads as well:Lee Hong gi gets the role of chaebol heir bachelor. I liked him OK here, though he is given a typical part I can't stand on these shows, i.e. he goes from smug to angry to sad to in love, with little to no room in between. Star struck teenage girls might find these roles appealing, but they are extremely limited. Fortunately, Hong gi's character does get the opportunity to eventually show some more range, and he's not bad when given the chance.Yang Jin sung plays the female lead in a dual role as greedy construction company daughter and poor girl who plays her sacrificial double. Actually, she plays several other parts on this show as well in historical flashbacks. This is the first time I've seen her in a lead role, and I thought she performed rather well considering all the varying personalities she had to portray.Summary: I cannot recommend this show at all. The plot is as equally clich\u00e9d as it is absurd and the writers seem convinced it's a good idea to shoehorn every mood and genre theme into this show to cover as many bases as possible. Unfortunately, they are in no way creative or intelligent enough to pull this off successfully. If you're going to make a crazy murderous supernatural love story, then stick to your guns and go for it. Don't vacillate between that and a formulaic growth heal love story where even murderers deserve love in the end, because you'll just end up with slop like this show.

I watched The kingdom of the Winds (I am sure the title sounded better in its original language) on Drama Fever recently. Drama Fever brings top TV shows from around the world but mainly ones that are translated from Korean or Spanish. There are tons of gems on there and this is one of them. Korean TV has a huge and growing fan base around the world and with good reason, it's awesome!The Kingdom of the Winds follows the story of one of the great kings from one of the countries in what eventually became Korea. It starts from when he was abandoned as a baby (because of a dire prophecy about what he would do when he grew up), to when he had finally overcome the considerable odds to become a great king and takes over a bunch of other countries.Many of the shows that focus on early Korean history, are about the desire of the king to unify all of Korea. Like many countries, Korea used to be made up of a bunch of smaller kingdoms, which meant they all lived with the threat of being taken over by one of the other countries. The king who eventually unifies the country, would be remembered for a thousand years and let his people live in safety. A nice idea, except they all had that idea, so they seemed to live in perpetual war. This show is set in the early part of Korean history, fairly close to the time when the Romans were nailing a bloke called Jesus to wooden cross elsewhere in the world. This is a time when wars were waged with swords and arrows, which makes for great action sequences and fun TV.For the first half of the series, the shows star doesn't even know he is a prince, which gives him the opportunity to join the army as a regular soldier, learn to be a ninja and pick up loads of loyal lowly friends, who go on to become his loyal subjects when the truth about his identity is discovered. Slight rewind, yes, I said ninja. That term we use for men wearing cool suits, with martial arts skills we envy, doing secret nighttime missions in black masks. It seems that Koreans have their own version, as it is not the first Korean show I have seen which features them. In this show, they don't specifically refer to them as ninjas, but they look and act like them. Their secret group is called the black shadows, which sounds like the name of a ninja clan too. They are trained to posses super human fighting skills and they conduct missions at night wearing all black, with face masks. This ninja like group features heavily all the way through the series. They belong to an enemy country and the star of the show is captured by them. After they have tortured him for a while, he ends up joining them for a bit. In fact, just long enough to learn their fighting skills, before seeing the error of his ways and taking his new skills back home. His ninja skills makes him a compelling option to become crown prince in his home country. The perfect hero of the people   a royal prince, but one who is in touch with the common man, has experienced battle from the front line and has led a hard life, which gives him a level of resolve that eludes his girlie little brother. At first, his dad (the current king), doesn't know who he is. When his identity is discovered, he won't accept him (due to the prophecy about his future). Eventually, he wins him and everyone else over with his valiant acts and is proclaimed crown prince. Once the star has become king, the enemy continues to send its ninja like black shadows to try an assassinate him or kidnap his girlfriend (who happens to be an enemy princess). Having a history of being a black shadow himself, who better than our king to come up with a strategy to stop them? Like most of the Korean dramas I have watched, this show is great because of the variety of interesting characters, their complicated love interests, friendships and betrayals etc. They really take the time to develop each roll to the point where you feel like you know them.I have tried to be a little vague on the story as I don't want to ruin it for anyone and I don't like reviews where people try to write the book of the movie. All we really want to know from a review, is, should I watch it or not? The answer here is yes, for fans of actions movies, anything to do with martial arts or ninjas and fans of drama or history. It is also a good one to watch with the Mrs, as it satisfies our craving for action, and gives them the drama and love story that they need to stay interested. The action sequences are cool but not too gruesome, Now, for those of you who are afraid of subtitles and say things like I can't be bothered to read now, I just want to relax, stop being lazy! You are missing out on loads of amazing shows. You get used to subtitles after a while and it is really no problem. Haven't you ever read a book and found it relaxing?", "a marvelous mini series (if that's the correct term)which enthralls right from the start and never lets go. In it's  or so hours, it seldom puts a foot wrong. The performances from some of the actors including female are hard to gauge in particular the two leading men, and the leading actresses ie Oh Yoon Ah as hye ap, who i nominate as the sexiest female character I've seen in a long time, and we never even get to see her legs. Then there is Choi Jung Won as Princess Yeon, who is full of grace and serenity. But I have no doubt that the best performance comes from Jung Jin Young as king yuri. plaudits also to among others Kim Hye Ri as as Lady Mi Yoo (Yeo Jin's mother), and Han Jin Hee as King Daeso. yes, there are faults. There is plenty of fighting, but very little blood. At one stage, i thought a character who was being executed had survived. it looked like the executioners blade had missed him. but no, he had been killed. when one of the main characters is killed in a rather inhumane way, and his friend has the opportunity to treat the instigator in like manner, he doesn't. perhaps it's to do with Korean TV restrictions. the two leading male and female characters are not without fault. At one stage, she poisons someone, and he has a tendency at times to kill people who are no threat to him. perhaps it was just one person, i can't remember. i see those as positive aspects of the series. When one of the lead characters dies, my heart broke. and i cried like anything. That is one of the great strengths of Korean movies and TV dramas; the emotion they can get from you, and also how they involve you in the stories. highly recommended without reservations"], "Sentiment Score": 1.0}, "1157": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1017": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1421": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["*** Does contain spoilers. ***If THE LONG VACATION is Japanese TV's calling card to the international TV market, then ROOFTOP ROOM CAT or ROOFTOP CAT or ATTIC CAT must be South Korea's standard bearer.ROOFTOP ROOM CAT involves a rich lost in life college boy who wants the sexy rich girl who wants the successful business man who wants the poor but responsible girl who wants the rich lost in life college boy.It is a great love quad angle with lots of forceful parents and grandparents adding to the drama.

He saves Kim Taehee the princess in this drama from her medically induced coma. The villain is Jo Hyun Jae the evil greedy corporate brother and they are also in a medical setting with decent supporting cast. It's fast, fun and fearless. The only thing that bothered me was how the story starts to sink when the evil brother dies. The show should have ended with the death of the evil brother. Instead you get couple of episodes at the end which fills like a filler. Of course Joo Won has been in a medical drama before Good Doctor where he shone as the doctor with autism. He is brilliant here very brilliant, he is part doctor stuntman hustler and what not. Joo Won is very good here. Kim Taehee is competent in her role but not brilliant here. The only surprising thing about this show is the career turning move and the breakout performance of Jo Hyun Jae who plays the evil brother. This is really the first time he has played a villain of course he played a smirky sneaky adman in Ad Genius Lee Tae Baek, but this is a full on villain role. Jo Hyun Jae is that actor that has always played the sweet baby faced hero prince in countless Korean dramas. Here, he is menacing, intelligent, cold, heartless, articulate and passionate. Who knew he had that inside of him? The scene of the dinner party is a standout scene for Jo Hyun Jae. This is a revelation not to be taken lightly.

This drama is more focusing on Han Yoe Jin's survival with Yong pal Kim Tae Hyun's help throughout eps while the title yong pal means gang doctor doesn't really right for the whole story, also inserting their love story. I really enjoy this drama because of Kim Tae Hee's incredible acting. I'm not really a big fan of her, her dramas which I watched are stairway to heaven, love story in harvard, iris, jang OK jung not really appealing for me and her acting felt so so but in My princess and yong pal she really did a good job. Here she was acting great portraying a hurtful, loving, and cruel person at the same time and when she did cruel things instead of hating her I felt sympathy to her since we the audiences could understand her reasons and her pains for doing so. Not just a pretty face but this woman really can act. It's hard to gain audiences' sympathy nowadays since audiences' become smarter each time.However Joo Woon really disappointing while I was his fan at first but now I have to change that. Watching him first time since Baker king followed by Good doctor and Nodame cantabile (Korean version) feel that yong pal is his most degrading acting. He really didn't have many expressions either receiving bad and sad news, even felt disappointed he showed nothing very lack of affection towards his wive while he claimed he loves his wive so much nearing the end of the eps.This drama should have ended at  but the producer decided to extend it to  eps since they wanted the main couple to have a happy ending which I find unnecessarily. The story is perfect ending at  where Han yoe jin and kim tae hyun saying good bye to each other due to the difference thought of life, she is a leader of multi national companies in her hand lies thousands of people life depending on her good and cruel leadership while he is a naive doctor who is not thinking bright of humans' mind and rather stupid of business's world helping her evil brother just like betraying his own wive but he did not realize that. Both characters are too different to each other to live together unless she can let go of her company or he let go of his naive thoughts and what he called a kindness if not he'll be continued being used as a tool to hurt her. The writer of this drama at first making yong pal's character really good and bright he understood how the society works but nearing the end the writer wanted to make a conflict between a lover hence creating the naivety of yong pal who was being raised as a poor child and had already felt the cool and the cruel reality of the world which rather not make sense, I blame the writer and the producer who was trying to change the original concept of this drama to their own mellow dramatized version.Yes it's a happy and short ending.", "There are lots of good kdramas, but only perhaps a dozen or so which really stand out as better than the rest.

In many ways, it often feels much more like a Japanese life lessons drama for teens, or an older American type after school special, than it does a modern Korean melodrama (except, it goes on a crazy revenge tale bender for a while in the middle of things).Here's your story: Choi Ji Woo stars as the titular character, and she is one strange housekeeper to say the least. She's hired by a recently widowed husband with a family of  young kids to be maid nanny cook of the household. The Housekeeper is essentially a mirror image of Mary Poppins; she can do everything and anything and even comes with a magic bag from which to pull whatever is needed for any given circumstance. She's also very precise, never smiles, and is completely devoid of emotion. As such, at first blush, it would almost appear she must be some type of sentient android or ghostly reincarnation or what have you.After a rocky start between them, the kids eventually take a cautious liking to their new housekeeper while their dad is busy trying to get his sh*t together; the dad is primarily portrayed as a cowardly man & absentee father for much of the early part of this show. Thus, the kids start to rely on the housekeeper more and more, and since she obeys EVERY order requested of her, they quickly find she can be quite useful. Being kids though, they frequently make some awfully rash requests that entail killing, sex, & or general mayhem. SPOILERS NOTE: there is no actual killing or sex involved, since the kids come to their senses & or chicken out before any real damage can be done.Over time, the housekeeper helps the kids learn & heal & grow via some often unconventional methods; the kids then slowly come to think of her as more of a mom than a housekeeper, and they eventually want her to join their family to replace the mom they just lost. First though, they need to figure out what happened in her past to make her so emotionless and help her become more a loving human being once again. Along about this time, a maniacal businessman is introduced into the story; the housekeeper is convinced this is the person responsible for ruining her life, and she sets out to make him pay for his perceived sins. This amounts to a very strange interlude to the tone of the original story, but it nevertheless serves as the means to uncovering the housekeeper's history and having her heal her own past wounds.That's basically it. Otherwise, it's just a matter of following along to see if kids & dad can grow closer and move on with life, see if housekeeper can resolve her past & present issues with the mysterious businessman (if she doesn't outright kill him), and to see if housekeeper is willing & ready to become part of a new family.Choi Ji Woo is rather good as the housekeeper, but this is such an unusual role; she's afforded few opportunities to break from her rigid character, though she is quite effective while acting within it. Lee Sung Jae adequately portrays the flawed man that tries to become a better dad & person over time. The businessman guy and love interest girl do their jobs well enough. There are a couple of other side characters as well: the clutzy aunt, the father in law & the housekeeper agency boss with their own relationship,and some neighbors, that are primarily on hand for some filler and buffoonery. Then, there are the kids, and, well, Yikes!The kids are focused on considerably throughout (particularly the  girls); each of the kids get their own story line, and the eldest daughter gets her own recurring sub story as a member of the lamest group in the history of KPop. The purpose of this story line isn't really focused on their music, but they are laughably bad performers nonetheless; however, the young actress that played this role did give a very nice performance overall throughout this show. The rest of the kids get progressively younger though, and they often have some difficulty handling the subject material in a satisfactory manner. I'm not going to sit here and bash a bunch of child actors actresses, but it's awfully hard to expect what looks like a  year old girl to keep up with the manic shooting pace of a KTV drama, let alone sufficiently pretend to comprehend and deal with her mom's suicide, a crappy dad, and all the other adult themes swirling around her; this poor little girl can barely even read her lines, yet she's practically THE central figure in trying to build a familial relationship with the robotic housekeeper, and this obviously creates some considerable problems during some of the more dramatic scenes involving the two of them.All in all, I didn't think this show was all that great, though it does have its moments here and there. It's such an unusual mix of flavors, tones, & story that I'm not even sure who the target audience for this thing is supposed to be; it's often too mature for kids, likely not flashy or sexy enough overall for late teens & young adults to identify with, and, it's somewhat unsuited for more seasoned K drama viewers looking for a traditional melodrama fix. In addition, I think this probably would have been a far better show if the housekeeper businessman relationship was completely omitted in lieu of focusing solely on the life lesson family value personal healing aspect that serves as its foundation.Bottom Line: . out of  stars.", "Here we have Ji Woo Choi (Winter Sonata, Stairway To Heaven) giving a MAGNIFICENT performance as an unsmiling housekeeper to a family who just lost their mother to suicide.

It goes by a few other names as well: Damo; The Undercover Detective, Female Detective Damo, etc.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: It's Joseon era Korea, and various law enforcement factions throughout Korea are looking to rid the country from crime and corruption. This story focuses on the daily inner workings of one of the state police sections, which include  of the  primary characters of this series. One of these characters is the handsome, young, righteous police commander played by Lee Seo jin. The other character is the Damo, who is played by Ha Ji won.A Damo is a low level police servant, who is usually from a less than stellar upbringing and is of poor social status. However, this particular Damo has become a highly skilled, smart, ambitious, loyal, likable, ass kicking, beauty. As such, she soon rises from a nobody to a trusted & respected member of the police force. She's done all she can in life to get ahead on her own, but, much of her accrued knowledge, abilities, and current status are due specifically to her section commander, who took her under his wing when she was a young orphan, and helped her become who she is in the present.Ha Ji won is soon sent undercover to infiltrate a band of thieves; there she meets their leader who's the rd primary character involved in the story (played by Kim Min joon). Like the police commander, he's also a handsome, righteous, young man, except he operates on the opposite side of the law. He's not a bad guy per se however; he's more of a Robin Hood type who fights for the people, and helps the poor and sick from being marginalized and mistreated by the powers that be.Being a Korean melodrama, the  male leads fight for what they believe is right, while they compete for the affection of the female lead in some fashion or another. There's also the sibling angle at play here as, unbeknownst to everyone, the Damo is actually (SPOILERS) the long lost sister of the leader of the thieves. In addition, the police commander is sort of a surrogate brother to the Damo, as they've spent much of their lives growing up and living & working together. From there, it's just a matter of which of the two leads will win out, and which man the Damo will choose to side with in the end. I liked this show pretty well overall, and, it holds up surprisingly well even a decade after it aired. There's a fair amount of swordplay and wire fu involved on occasion, and although the budget couldn't have been too enormous, the action rarely looks overly silly. The  main leads all do a solid job, as do several other secondary cast members. And, the story is fairly interesting and quickly paced for the most part over its  episode run time.One of the better aspects of this show is that the  main male leads are both treated fairly equally. These are both mostly honorable men, and this makes it difficult for the Damo to decide which side she wants to be on. The story, smartly & effectively, never lets you clearly delineate which side (& man) is right and which side (& man) is wrong.One of the more odd aspects of this story, is that it occasionally tends to want to be a romantic love story. The police commander begins to fall in love with the Damo, but she is somewhat of an adopted little sister to him. The Damo begins to fall in love with the leader of the thieves, but he is her actual brother. I guess one could argue that's just the way it was in that era in regards to the commander Damo relationship, and since the Damo didn't initially know the thief was her actual brother, it provides an excuse for her to begin to fall for him. Nevertheless, I found this dual sibling vs love interest angle bordering on being a little creepy at times. One more thing, please stop with the female fighter disguising herself as a man in various Asian martial arts period pieces. You can cover up a girl's hair and rub dirt on her face all you want, but it is impossible to mistake any of the actresses they typically do this with (and Ha Ji won is no exception) as anything other than beautiful women, in any time period.This show has a few minor problems here and there, but what KTV melodrama doesn't?...All in all though, it is enjoyable and entertaining enough to recommend. It flows along pretty well throughout, it's written well enough to get the job done, and, it's not afraid to do what they wish (dramatically wise) to one or more of the characters you've invested in by the time it all wraps up.With all due respect to the other  IMDb reviewers of this show to date; A) this is not a  star watch by any means or rational, and, B) the other reviewer completely misunderstood how the Damo and her brother ultimately resolved their story line.It's plenty watchable though. A rock solid  out of  stars in my opinion!", "Damo is an excellent, well paced Korean drama set in ancient Korea. It has a great cast (some character roles are comically intense), over the top (if somewhat low budget) special effects, and plenty of emotion if you let the drama suck you into its world. The story is surprisingly violent in some scenes, so watching it with young children might not be advised. Also it should be noted that doing some research into ancient Korean culture might aid in explaining some of the cultural trends and rules present, as the drama might not always explain itself, however this doesn't detract from the story. It is not nearly as long as some of the dramas out there, so it can be finished in a reasonable amount of time, or you can cram it into an all night session if you can't get enough.", "Damo, a historical kdrama set in Chosun era, is centered around three compelling characters who are pigeon holed by society and strain to change society to allow a new paths to be taken to fulfill their dreams. Chae OK (central character), is a damo (servant) for the police and amazingly also a police investigator. How could she have this role in a society that valued her only as a possession? Hwangbo Yoon, the police captain, is her childhood friend protector and facilitates her investigator role. When the police are assigned to crack a counterfeit coin case, Chae OK volunteers to go undercover to investigate a gang of rebels. Here Chae OK meets Jang Sung baek, the rebel leader, who dreams of a society that is not ruled by class but equally by all the people. His dream draws Chae OK like a moth to a flame. Her struggle to choose between the two men plays out as the plot thickens and the woven web draws them to a fated climax. What I loved about this drama: ) Chae OK is smart, determined, fearless, and headstrong. She is one of the strongest women characters I've seen portrayed. ) Equally appealing male leads. A. Hwangbo Yoon was steadfast, honorable, and loyally loved only Chae  OK. But society would never allow Chae OK (a servant) to be in a sanctioned relationship with Hwangbo Yoon (a higher class). B. Jang Sung baek, was a visionary with a passion for a free society not ruled by class. His new world would provide Chae OK opportunities not possible in current society. ) Supporting characters that contributed. There were no dead weight characters in the supporting cast. I secretly loved Officer Lee with the dashing scar. ) Appropriate Ending. I agreed with the writer's choices, it could end no other way for these three characters. What I did not love: ) Wire work fighting style was over the top unrealistic and off putting. It literally defied gravity. I prefer a hand to hand sword fighting style (e.g. Chuno, Warrior Baek Dong Soo). ) Pacing was ponderously slow in many episodes. ) Why can't characters have a complete conversation? So much agony could be avoided if complete conversations took place. You can make this claim for many kdramas as misunderstandings are major plot drivers. ) Turns out that Chae OK's headstrong ways were selfish at times and the risks she took had a ripple effect of negative consequences for many other characters.", "Beautiful performance by Ha Ji won. But I was troubled by the following. () Why did the captain take so long to tell Jang, that Chai was his sister. Was it because he wanted him to kill him, so that he wouldn't have to kill the brother of the girl he was in love with. () Jang was too quick to believe that Chai would have been involved in the massacre of the lepers. He had spent enough time with her in the cave to know, that she wasn;t the type of person to do something like that. Even if he did believe it, it wasn't in his nature not to have looked in her eyes before he killed her. Obviously the idea was to make him believe he had killed her. but what happens if he ran into her afterwards. If it had been me, i think it would have been better to have threatened the life of the rebel girl. () When Jang finds that Jai is alive, after he was supposed to have killed her, he doesn't seem too surprised() The ending. It didn't get the tear ducts going. Maybe because, I knew that it was going to be tragic, But as far as I could see, she still stabs him, even after she finds out that he's her brother. Okay. maybe, she was just too blinded with the idea of revenge against the man who killed the captain.Anyway, here's my ending. The captain is not dead. He finds out that Jai has gone to kill her brother. As she delivers the death blow, he (the captain)cries out that he's her brother. But it's too late. She cries in anguish, and finally kills herself.Oh, one other thing. The wuxia element. Exciting enough to watch. But in relation to Jai, because I can only think about in relation to her. Sometimes she used it, and sometimes she didn't. Was it only effective in certain hours of the day or what? :)"], "Sentiment Score": 0.5275}, "66": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["Maybe I was expecting too much out of this one. However, I picked up a star on the road didn't deliver for me.That said, the start was good, with some suspence vibes and thriller scenes. The characters were odd and the situations even wierder.

However, the rest of the story just didn't fit that fresh mold that the drama promised. The plot started getting predictable.And then, there were the characters.

's I am Happy didn't make me happy. I wasn't really glad with how the South Korean film turn out. Loosely inspired by author Lee Cheong Jonn's short novel 'Mr. Cho, Man deuk'; which tells the story of two people living life at a Korean psychiatric ward. This movie directed & written by Yoon Jong Chan slightly change the novel's story plot to something else; which in return, cause this film to end up, more like a mess than a masterpiece. The movie tells the story of two people; Cho Man su (Hyun Bin) a patient suffering from a mental illness & his nurse, Soo kyung (Lee Bo young). Both are painfully going through some issues, due to the fact, that other people dependent on them. In Cho Man Su's case, he was deeply mistreat by his mother suffering from dementia and his brother addicted to gambling to the point, that he turned crazy. For Soo Kyung, the stress of her work, added to the pressure of taking care of her serious ill, father is causing her to go into a deep depression. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I really didn't like how this movie was market in the United States, as romantic comedy when it clearly not. There is barely any sign of romance in the film at all, between the two main characters. I don't think the main guy even develops a crush on the girl at all. The same with the woman. I never saw the relationship being more than Nurse Patient relationship. So, it was odd to see it, market as more than that. If you're looking for Hyun Bin to be the handsome leading man in a romantic comedy like his 's TV show 'My Lovely Sam Soon' or 's 'The Secret Garden', then you will be sorely disappointed by 'I am Happy'. There isn't even any really funny moments for him to shine in. In truth, there isn't anything, but heartbreaking moments. It was very misleading. That's false advertising, big time! I don't know, why they had to lie, to make audiences want to see it. The movie was still somewhat compelling to watch, with its psychological melodrama. If, there is anything good, about it, the acting wasn't that bad. Yes, the movie has a lot more slow and dull moments, where the actors does nothing, but stare like mindless zombies, but at least, there are some instants, where each of their character can really stand out and shine. Sadly, those intense emotional moments are far too little. Most of the movie is endless amount of talking scenes; which had dialogue that was mostly boring. The pacing for this film is also horrible. It really talks forever to tell, the story of these two. Hardly any action going on. Added to the pressure, is weird way, the film intercuts flashbacks. It's so confusing; one minute, Cho Man Su in the hospital, the next minute, he's running a car repair shop, another second, he's getting out of the hospital. The movie is full of odd place scenes like that. There is no sense of story structure. The movie is also missing a lot of exposition scenes as well. I can see the extent to which a brother with a gambling addiction and mother with dementia could send him over the edge, however, honestly, I still don't know, how Cho Man Su came under the delusion that he was a Swiss Millionaire. It seem like he had no idea, where Switzerland, was before this, nor did he shown any interest in being a millionaire, before then. So where did he get the idea? I also don't get, how his story, relations to the nurse's story. Yes, both people are dealing with illness, but dealing with mental illness is way difference than physical illness. There is hardly any connection with the two story concept. The movie even lose focus at times. One scene, has Man Su trying to stand up against shock therapy as if he is Randle McMurphy from 's One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. This over sense of rebellion, seem a little too out of character for him, even as a crazy guy. It really comes out of nowhere. Also, the sense that he's happy with his craziness is not really established, well. I didn't sense that he was happy with all the blank staring at walls. So I don't get it. Overall: This film is so poorly written that it just end up being uber confusing and way too long and depressing to enjoy. Not a great watch.

All the highs and lows of love are here and presented through visually emotional camera work as well low key yet powerful acting. When I'd finished watching, there was a gut wrenching feeling in me that lingered for days. There is little dialogue in this film. Yet it speaks volumes because of the performances of Lee Young Ae and Yu Ji Tae. Each look, each gesture, each simple touch said more than a thousand words. If you want a genuine portrayal of a love affair from its beginning to its end, then watch this.", "This isn't a film about plot, so I'll concentrate on describing the main characters. Sang Woo is a single sound engineer living with his family. Eun su is a radio show host who lives about  hours away, by herself in a small, somewhat messy apartment. They meet to record the sound of wind in a bamboo forest for her radio show, and a relationship develops between them. The film observes them over the course of the changing seasons in Korea, starting in the Spring both in terms of the calendar and their relationship.The pace is deliberate, and the characters don't really change much, but the film is beautiful and, not surprisingly, lovely to listen to, and it's definitely worth seeing. I think that the male lead (Ji tae Yu) is particularly good in his role. My understanding is that the film won the top prize at Korea's equivalent to the Academy Awards.I saw this at the San Francisco International Film Festival on   , where an earlier showing was the U.S. premiere. The director was present to answer questions, through an interpreter, and one of his responses indicated that viewers who are more experienced in love tend to identify with the female lead, while those less experienced see themselves in the male character.", "Although Alfred Lord Tennyson said, Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all, anyone who has endured the breakup of an intense relationship would not necessarily agree. Certainly not Lee Sang woo, the young sound engineer from Seoul, Korea in Hur Jin ho's exquisite second feature One Fine Spring Day (literally Spring day goes). In the film of quiet power, two young people meet, fall in love, then gradually pull back and withdraw, but the film is not about their circumstances, but about the impermanence of life and how we must learn to ride the roller coaster. Like Hur's  film Christmas in August, it is a realistic and intimate work, filled with a touching lyricism that never succumbs to manipulative devices.Working to record sounds of nature for a radio station, Sang woo and radio disc jockey Han Eun su meet at a bus station in a most unusual way. Unable to wake her from a bench in the waiting room, he calls her on his cell phone even though she is sitting right next to him. As they work together, their relationship develops slowly. She has recently been divorced and he lives at home with his father, aunt, and grandmother. The joy of discovering a new relationship is conveyed against a background of nature \u0096 its mountains, forests, and streams and, as we listen to the two recording the sound of the wind against the bamboo and the wheat fields, we are struck by the mood of serenity created by the cinematography of Kim Hyeong gyu and the original music of Jo Sung woo, based on the French ballad, Plaisir D'amour.Impermanence is a constant theme in the film and the seasons represent various stages in the character's relationship. To underscore the fleeting nature of love, Sang woo's grandmother denies that her deceased husband was ever unfaithful to her and, barely in touch with reality, goes to the train station everyday to wait for him. Though Eun su lives in the provinces, she and Sang woo begin to meet each other after work and spend some nights together. On the surface, they are an attractive couple   warm, sensitive, and very cute together. But Hur drops hints that each, in their own way is eager to pull away from what looks like it might become a lasting relationship. Though the reason for their growing coolness toward each other is not specifically defined, she may be reacting to the fallout from her last marriage or may be put off by his tendency to cling. In his first real relationship, he may be having thoughts that it is too soon to close off other possibilities in life.Neither, however, communicates their fears and, like a flower that is not being nurtured, their relationship is allowed to wither. As she withdraws, he pursues her even more, giving her the upper hand and placing her in a controlling position and Sang woo is run by his expectations and disappointment, drinking and hiding out when things start to turn sour. In One Fine Spring Day, we learn that, as in the Buddhist tradition, life has the characteristics of instantaneity, impermanence, and decay and that the three realms are deceptive and illusory in nature. We share Sang woo's discovery of the joy of love and also its confusion and pain. Literally, not too much happens in the film, and, on paper it sounds ordinary, but, like the poetry of Walt Whitman, if we look beneath the surface we can easily see the divine in the commonplace.", "This is another very quiet film by Hur about the relationship between two people.  Like Christmas in August the direction is such that excessive dialogue is unnecessary.  We know what the two people involved are thinking at all times through their eyes, the way the look (or don't look) at each other.It's a story that anyone who has had any experience in love will immediately recognize and get that I have been there feeling.  The film doesn't sympathize with one person or the other but you probably will empathize with one of them based on your own experiences in love and loss.  Two people fall in love, one of them falls out of love (or does she?), is anyone to blame?", "Although I didn't like April Snow, I have to admit that I got curious about it's clinical, meditative, and almost Ozu like approach to start searching out its director's previous films. One Fine Spring Day is Hur Jin Ho's second feature film. Surprisingly though, the film feels like it's been crafted by a master who's been making films for decades. One Fine Spring Day evokes a certain sense of maturity and control that deflects the low points of its spare plot. Sang woo (Yu Ji tae) is a sound engineer who lives with his father and his senile grandmother. He gets a job to record certain sounds of nature with beautiful radio DJ Eun su (Lee Young ae). Sang woo, who seems to be an extrovert and Eun su, who is more outgoing and openminded, get along very well and start a relationship. Their relationship, however, is not the type that would last forever as both characters are very different and both have issues that need to be resolved. Those seeking something that will provide for a fuzzy joyous romantic feeling would easily get disappointed with One Fine Spring Day. One Fine Spring Day, despite its rather light atmosphere, holds a bittersweet conclusion that feels all too real for comfort. It matches the joys of falling in love with the pangs of an unexplained break up. The beauty of the film doesn't emanate from the plot, or the characterizations, or even the technical merits, but from Hur's surehanded direction that never seems to stray from its melancholic tone. Hur doesn't waste time in dealing with heartwarming moments or scenes of melodramatic intensity. He satisfies himself with sincere moments of silence that somehow evoke great emotional weight. One Fine Spring Day is a lovely film. I loved the fact that it never breaks into serious drama or comedy. It stays right there, comfortable in the middle, chronicling in a very sure manner the failing relationship of the couple. It's very different from April Snow which I thought tried too hard to build up its setup with a more ominous atmosphere that bogs down whatever talent and effort Hur and the rest of his crew put in entirely."], "Sentiment Score": 0.8842857142857143}, "780": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["An extremely impressive drama, very well executed by all the actors who portrayed their characters well.

There is so much to say but it's all hard to put into words ... it is simply a wonderful drama, a must see.", "I have watched all the episodes  times already.\nNothing more to recommend.\nWatch it and feel it.\nEverything is excellent from Directing, Writing, Acting and all OSTs.", "On Friday, April , , I have finished watching EP of My Mister. This TV serial is indeed worth watching.On the whole, this TV series is highly fascinating and very attractive. The picture of this TV drama gives an excellent sense and quality feel. The OST is another main attraction. The actors' emotional performances are also in place. The makeup and costumes of the various characters are an important part of the plot development of this TV series. For example, the close ups of her bare ankles and thin, dirty shoes appearing in various parts of the play, plus the fact which Lee Ji an has been wearing shabby clothes, indicate that she is very poor and short of money. The dark eye sockets and swollen eyes also illustrate that the life of Lee Ji an is miserable and depressed.\nIn terms of actor's lines, this TV series is still very excellent. For instance, facing a rogue property owner in EP, Park Dong hoon took advantage of his professional knowledge of the building structural engineer to speak out excellent lines, including the story of prison break. Finally, he performed practical actions to make this rascal property owner to apologize to his mother and brother. In EP , Park Dong hoon is a building structural engineer with solid basic construction knowledge and strong structural technical skills. When he was on his way home with her, Park Dong hoon told Lee Ji an not only about the contents of the work of the building structural engineer, but also described the relationship between internal forces and external forces in the construction structure. Thus, he derived the philosophy of life from the content of the knowledge of architectural structure. The lines are as follows:Lee Ji an: \nWhen everyone knows that you are an architect in future, you must be asked to provide help everywhere.Park Dong hoon: \nNot an architect, but a building Structural Engineer.\nAfter working here for so long, you don't even know what the company is running.Lee Ji an: \nAren't they all the same?Park Dong hoon: \nNot the same.\nThe architect is responsible for the design.\nBut building structural engineer have to think: if you want to construct the new building according to the design drawing blueprint, what kind of material you should use and how to do to make it safe. It is the person who performs calculation over and over again.\nAs literally speaking, it is the person who creates the structure.\nAll buildings are the struggle between external forces and internal forces.\nThe wind, the load, the vibration.\nCalculate all the possible external forces.\nThen design the internal force stronger than the external force.\nThe apartment should be designed to bear kg per square meter.\nA crowded schools or lecture halls requires to be designed a much higher load.\nOnly one level of dining room needs to be designed different loads for different places where people sit and where the weight apparatus are laid up.\nIt has always been necessary to design internal forces more strongly than external forces.\nLife is also the same.\nMaybe it is the war between internal forces and external forces.\nNo matter what happens,\nas long as you have internal force, you can hold on.\nThe characters of this TV series can represent various kinds people in today's society.Park Dong hoon represents a class of people: It is a part of the middle aged middle class that is under a lot of great pressure, but still struggling to live. In the plot of this TV series, he is a kind and considerate person who always wants to take care of his family and loved ones (not just his wife alone). He didn't want to tell his wife and other family members about unfavorable things what he encountered at work. Without no income problems, he still suffered from other sources from mental stress, causing him to live like a walking dead in daily life. The reasons for the above problems are:a. Park Dong hoon had to provide for his elder brother and younger brother in need because they had a very poor life at that time.b. His marriage was under strain at the moment.c. His mother eagerly hoped that he would prove to be an elite in the family.d. In the power struggle within the company, Park Dong hoon was marginalized by Do Joon young who is a high   ranking officer, his college juniors and his wife's secret lover. The above points indicate that many problems can not be solved by money. These are the frustration of a part of the middle class. Looking at this type of crowd on the surface, the conclusion is not bad for all aspects, such as good work, good family and adequate leisure time. Even if they work diligently and conscientiously every working day, the troubles or misery of life given to this type of people are endless, so they cannot live a relaxed life.\nLee Ji an represents a class of people: the bottom class of the society. In this TV series,Lee Ji an is a very hard to reach young man with a callous face all day long, which is due to her heavy burden of life. Many time during working hours, she deliberately made the sound of the photocopier so loud that she irritated her office colleagues because of certain problem with the photocopier. Her colleagues asked her to take an A  paper, but she opened the drawer with her feet and asked her colleague to bend over to pick it up by himself. Close to the end of the working day,she stole the free coffee powder from the tea room in the office unobtrusively with the purpose of serving as a part of dinner. At night she also continued to work part time in the restaurant. While washing the dishes, she stole the leftovers and then took them home to eat. Even worse at the age of , she killed a loan shark who abused and assaulted her and her grandmother due to usurious loan. Today, Lee Gwang il, who had inherited his father's debt collection as the loan shark, not only asked Lee Ji an to pay back the money like an evil landlord, but also often beat her like a demon and even vowed to torture her forever. To fight against the harsh circumstances, she had the maturation that was not commensurate with her age and owned her inborn instinct wisdom. At the starry night when the moon is clear, Lee Ji an smuggled her paralyzed and deaf grandmother out with the bed because she could not afford the cost of the sanatorium. In order to survive and because of the distrust of this society, she can basically ignore the corresponding rules when at works, but her heart is yearning for kindness. With the development of the drama caused by the merchandise coupon which was worth  million Korean Won, the contact between Lee Ji an and Park Dong hoon had increased gradually. Lee Ji an understood Park Dong hoon's kindness, tolerance and love for his family. Park Dong hoon also knew Lee Ji an's goodness and strength. For example, Park Dong hoon said to Lee Ji an, you are really kind. Besides, Lee Ji an told Park Dong hoon because he scolds you and because you hate him. They were guarding each other in their own way with mutual sympathy but without any trace of comfort. It seems that two people who are about to freeze could gather together to warm themselves up. In EP, when Park Dong hoon fought with Lee Gwang il who was the loan shark due to Lee Ji an's debt problem, Lee Ji an eavesdropped on this scene through his mobile phone, and then squatted on the side of the road and cried. The plot of  My Mister finally ushered in the first climax. For people like Lee Ji an in the lower classes, survival has been the greatest victory and the rest things are luxuries.Wait for me to update", "Started watching this drama with no expectation, thinking it is just another slice of life drama. I have to say at the beginning like at least  episodes it did somehow feel as such, a drama that totally people in general able to relate to and even a bit slow, boring with the many conversations in between characters and with the focus on office politics. However if you stay on and immerse yourself into any of these characters as they move along with the story plot, I guarantee you will feel rewarded on the experience of what relationships between humans really are and how we are all just surviving and thriving (or failing) in the act of being in relationships with one another. This drama stays true to its theme on exploring and unfolding human relationships   love (also self love and care), belongingness, betrayal, forgiveness, acceptance, letting go, and I can go on and on because I'm amazed by the writer nim's ability to pack so many things in  episodes and yet it all fits accordingly and not overwhelming the story plot at all!The existence of the male MC, Park Dong Hoon in this story and the way it is being written really carried all the other characters so well throughout the plot   he is really just an ordinary genuine ahjussi, at some point in your life, you wish you get to meet in real life or perhaps you have even met such a person before. He has his own shares of life frustration but always chose to do things that would determine the outcome of what already happened (staying in control) and not wallow in what already happened (e.g., blame or accept his 'destiny'). His attitude of if you see it as nothing then it will become nothing and life goes on, is really a good learning point in life. Try putting yourself in the shoes of the female MC, Lee Ji An, and experience the tough life she had to go through (someone who accepted her 'destiny') and understanding her reactions and actions as well as what made her blurred the line between gratitude and romance because in the end how do we, as human beings express of our love to someone whom we see as angel sent to us and telling us life is what we made of, instead of destiny. This drama not only developed strongly anchoring on these two characters but also the entire characters in the neighborhood detailed in the drama. I see it as every single characters revealed in this drama are as equally important to showcase how we all influence one another when we gather together in our lives. From relationships among family members (siblings, mother sons, grandparent grandchild) to brotherhoods who stay in same neighborhood (the extended society family) to the 'family' at work and to the point that even a monk character speak volume in this drama   all depicting the sense of belongingness in human beings that is so reflective of reality world. Their interactions in this drama are gems, teaching you the many perspectives of life.I am just so grateful and satisfied with this drama that lived up to its title and for the writer nim who preserve the beauty of the relationship between the two MCs without tainting it with the usual reciprocating romance theme. The most memorable thing from this drama for me, apart from the awesome casts' performances, is to slowly decipher and digest the meaningful conversations between the MCs especially with the constant illustration using metaphors. Oh and the music and bgm throughout the drama are like, prefect to the core. The whole wire tapping and listening to the audio along with Lee Ji An   every single sound was crisp clear and really made it feel as if the audience is transported into it. Also up until now there are still various vivid scenes from the drama that keep appearing to me visually, such as the walk home at the neighborhood between the MCs and the subway train ride.

Some situations were a little far stretched, like the good hearted reactions at certain times (you'll know when you watch episodes ten and on).

They eventually fall in love, but they are stuck into a vampire human war. After that, we move on to the last season (each season is about four episodes or so, as the drama has only  episodes!). In the rd season, we are back in the modern world, where the boy still can't remember the girl, who volunteers for a programme, where she has to reveal her vampire identity to the world and try to live along with the humans, who don't accept her. Okay, the concept was good. I particularly liked the second and the third season (well, half of it), as they were quite interesting. The first season felt too rushed, and, as I was ignorant to the fact that the drama was divided into three seasons, I was surprised that the story was concluded in episode ! An other thing that didn't work for me, was the band concept. I thought it was childish and too unrealistic, not that they weren't talented, but to get to be idols?? In addition, the performances were so so. The female lead wasn't good, especially in the first season, but got a little better towards the end.

His conservative party is all about maintaining the status quo for the ruling body and the nation's elite, and her tiny liberal party is all about reform and the betterment of the lives of the average citizen. Both representatives have fiery personalities and disagree on most everything from the start, but they soon begin to understand each other a little better and begrudgingly find some mutual common ground over time. They're both attractive and single as well, and a romance soon develops between them. From there, is just a matter of observing their push and pull relationship unfold, and, to see if these two can will eventually be together despite their ideological differences & personal circumstances.This show is primarily geared towards the thirty something aged viewer (though it is suitable & agreeable to both younger & older audiences). It does come with some typical melodrama of course, but I'm warning you right now that there's ultimately very little of that stuff here in comparison to most other K dramas. This show tilts heavily on the romantic side of the KTV drama scale, with some numerous comedic moments mixed in. It is generally very upbeat in tone, and I don't recall a single character in this show that was ever sick, dying, handicapped, etc. So if you're looking for a despair filled makjang drama with an all out abundance of angst, crying, and absurd situations, this is likely not the show for you!The oft employed  act play method of storytelling is utilized here, along with the typical two secondary love interests. As usual, the  secondary leads don't stand a chance to get the guy girl they want, and they basically serve as impediments to the central love story; these characters push the limits of being too antagonistic at times, but hold back just enough so they aren't totally unsympathetic...Park Hee Soon and Han Chae Ah fill these roles effectively enough as Min Jung's character's former step brother, and the spunky reporter girl, respectively.There's a bunch of supporting characters as well, and they all serve their purpose satisfactorily enough. Several veterans and a couple of younger actors are on hand to fill out the roles of various aides and party members; most of these parts are devoted to dispensing advice and or providing a good bit of side humor along the way, and most of this was done well enough...the semi incompetent ruling party spokesman (i.e. porn man) is particularly useful as the never ending butt of jokes throughout this show, and, many of these side characters (at least under a certain age) have their own little romantic relationships to deal with. There's only one child on the scene, and she's mostly hilarious in a limited role as the astute and acerbic niece of Min Jung's character.The behind the camera crew holds up their end quite well. The show is sharply written and well directed, and there's some effective use of post edit screen captions & effects along the way. The soundtrack is pretty solid too, and it evolves nicely over time to suit the nature of the unfolding story. In addition, the transition of the  acts is done rather seamlessly without wildly changing the overall feel of the show (which is a frequent problem with some of these shows).Basically, this show gets all the little things right for the most part, which brings us around to the performance of the two leads, and they are both fantastic. This is a real nice pairing of two stars that have excellent chemistry together, and neither of them disappoint. Shin Ha Kyun is a terrific actor who's starred in a number of big screen productions over the years (several of which are some of my all time favorite Korean films); he hasn't been in many TV dramas to my knowledge until just recently, but he obviously has no problem making the transition to this type of production. For her part, Lee Min Jung is outstanding in her role; she brings a nice mix to the table of everything you could possibly want in your female rom com lead. There are lots of talented and attractive Korean actresses working in this genre, but it's hard to imagine any of them doing a better job with this material than she did.This show is quite good for what it is, and the demographic it's aimed at. There's hardly anything to even grumble about. My only real complaint is the eventual incorporation of a hidden bloodline & secret family back story (which seemed a bit forced and unnecessary). For the life of me, I have no idea why Korean TV seemingly can't make a single show without invoking some type of melodramatic trope like this somewhere along the line; this show was perfectly fine as just a straightforward romantic comedy, and it would have been better served if it just stayed that way from start to finish. There is plenty of opportunity to include that type of melodramatic story line in any number of other shows.This is not the type of show that's likely going to pull in big Korean TV ratings numbers, because it really just doesn't fit the mold for a KTV melodrama that most fans & viewers of this genre are looking for. That being said (written), this show is very witty, and it's often both charming and amusing.

It actually started off pretty well   established the characters, the potential main conflict, romantic pairings   but then it became very draggy and slow as the first half of the series unfolded. I felt like nothing was truly happening, just back and forth running to the Vice President which in turn made the Top Team consistently volatile. I felt like the politics got a little too heavyhanded that it took away from any actual focus on the Top Team's functioning. I wanted to see more medical cases that involved the patients in the story without a myriad of extenuating complications brought about by the VP. I guess that was kind of the point, for the VP to keep pressuring the MTT, but it just got too tedious when every single episode that was the problem. The Top Team never even truly got running before it was immediately torn down, so in that regard I was disappointed.Large disappointments also arise with the plot (always meandering, never really focusing on and finishing each problem), but the character development was extra dismaying. We never got in depth backstories, no true insight to any of their intentions. No one really grew. The closest I'd say to have developed would be JJH's character Chief Han: we knew he has high ambitions primarily because he wants the approval of his father, we have the angst of his alcoholic single mother dying, we have him struggling with administration's expectations of him and his personal principles. KSW's character Park Tae Shin started off promising, but felt kind of forgotten in the second half of the series. Nothing really happened with his own mom angst, he was completely out of the MTT altogether so he mostly didn't fit in the main conflict anymore, which is quite confusing when he was billed to be the main lead? What I'm most mad about was JRW's character Seo Ju Young, though. Here was a potentially amazing female character: brilliant in her field, independent, ambitious, a prime example of a woman who's worked so hard to be strong so that she could excel even in a profession dominated by asshole men (mostly Chief Jang). I'm guessing they wanted her to kind of be like Cristina Yang from Grey's Anatomy in the way that she prioritizes her career and by doing so is seen as an emotionless robot. From her character introduction and initial episode appearances, they wanted her backstory to be something family related as well. What happened to that? Halfway through the series it was like she had no family at all. Nothing was really fueling her character by the end of the series. In the first half she at least had her ambition, but as the series closed her interest in keeping the Top Team running was entirely devoid of any reason. It was utterly disappointing to see considering she was my favorite character coming off the first few episodes. Romance wise, I was actually extremely pleased with how the lovelines turned out. I'm moreso saying this in terms of Chief Han and Seo Ju Young getting together as compared to Park Tae Shin and Choi Ah Jin (Oh Yeon Seo's character, who, as sad as I am to say it, was pretty much a useless character and only used as a prop. Like wth with that brain tumor nonsense at the end of the series? I will say they're cute, though, but thats mostly because Oh Yeon Seo is cute). In the beginning, I was seeing the connection between PTS and SJY   the cliche of upbeat man changes cold and standoffish girl   and was pretty okay with it. I didn't feel too invested, but I could see their potential. So I get it when people say that the turn of main lovelines from PTS SJY to Chief Han SJY was kind of confusing, because I also felt like midway through the series they just completely dropped developing the PTS SJY relationship   they barely interacted, and when they did it was just to discuss a case superficially. But I feel like HSJ SJY made the most sense to become the romantic endgame of the show   they have history, going all the way back to med school, that really propelled their relationship to me. Of course that shouldn't be the main criteria for a couple to end up together, but in terms of personality and work ethic, I think they were also perfectly matched. I see that people were saying that it didn't make sense because they always felt like SJY never showed any signs of reciprocating Chief Han's feelings, but in my opinion there were signs that she had a soft spot for him just as he had for her (his was just softer's, lol). You could see it when she smiled at seeing HSJ be happy about receiving praise from his father, which seems to imply that she knows how much he craves for that approval. She also seems to know the nature of his relationship with his mother (when she crashes their private dinner), and the issues he has with it, ergo asking him out to dinner to cheer him up. You could see how endeared she was to see him eat so sloppily too lol, as if it humanized him to her after so long of keeping up their professionalism. From my POV it wasn't that she lacked any feeling for him, it's just that she was always hesitant and, I feel, purposefully distant from him because she didn't want people to continue to think that the only reason for her success is because she's riding on his coattails and affections. That's one of the main conflicts with them so I think that's the reason for most of their emotional distance. I do like that she could be a pillar of strength for him by the end, especially with his mom dying, kind of turning the tables to the fact I've mentioned: it's not her that needs him, but the opposite. Chief Han's subtle proposal in the last episode was amazing, but mostly due to the fact thaf SJY was asleep while he was saying it haha! It was such a perfect way to close their story. As much as I liked their romance, I still came out of watching the series wishing that JJH and JRW would do another drama together with an actually good script, because they had great chemistry in MTT but was just failed by the writing.Overall, I'd say Medical Top Team was an okay watch. Not completely terrible, but definitely far from stellar. Watch it if you have a lot of free time, but if not, there's really not much you're missing out on (shallow moment, which I'm allowed to have at least once in a review!: besides Ju Ji HOON looking the best he's ever done, of course.)"], "Sentiment Score": 1.0}, "958": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["Fassbinder's Berlin Alexanderplatz () was a long movie   over  hours long. The Thornbirds, Roots and other early TV mini series were long movies broken into consecutive episodes. I love a mini series as a melodrama that tells a story in the long movie format, as opposed to those that tell different stories in the same setting (like Grey's Anatomy, Mad Men and to a lesser extent Damages, Breaking Bad, and Revenge that change the story at times while keeping to a general story). In this regard, I have discovered some gems in the South Korean TV mini series of recent years.The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back. This me recur in the same story. Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved. If personality dynamics are properly depicted in a valid manner, and if the production is skillful, powerful emotions can be evoked in the viewer. In this way we can live many lifetimes through movies, in our one lifetime   greatly enriching our incarnate experience.These South Korean productions (seen on Netflix streaming) are first class with excellent production and direction, some terrific casting and acting (particularly from some of the females who give some matchless world class performances), brilliant musical accompaniment, and staging. What makes these so good is the way they skillfully evoke deep emotion in the viewer. South Korean movie making is superb   world class.However, the following caveats must be considered by the USA viewer. They are subtitled and some people hate this. The South Korean cultural norms, values and sanctions may sometimes seems silly or old fashioned to the USA viewer. The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation unity   sometimes reminiscence of a old Frank Capra film.Most importantly, in order for the sometimes complicated sub plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing, and this leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people, that sometimes seem to be unlikely by USA cultural standards. The viewer may wonder at times why good but trusting people are so easily manipulated and deceived by bad and selfish people, but con artists do often succeed (just look at politicians for example). However this poetic license of improbability is needed to develop the story   just accept it as occurring even though unlikely at times. Taking these factors into account Will help you become involved and emotionally engrossed. It was hard t for me to quit watching at times so I binged watched.I would rank these as follows but tastes differ and your rankings might not agree:     (hard to say which is best)Shining InheritanceWhen a Man LovesThat Winter, The Wind BlowsSecret Garden. Five Fingers. The Scent of a Woman. The Great Queen Seondeok. A Hundred Years Inheritance. Lie To me. Roof Top Prince. Dr. Jin. The Great DoctorShining inheritance is about family, love, greed, deceit, manipulation, altruism, and other dynamics important in the pursuit of happiness. It is nicely paced over  episodes, in fully developing the story, but the viewer must stick with it at least halfway to get the full emotional impact of the story. Perhaps more coherent than other of the above mini series, it could be your favorite.", "Just finished watching this drama, although it's dated it's still worth a watch if you are watching Korean TV drama. I saw past reviews and it compared this show to current US drama. This is much different this show is warm, chilling and frightening at the same time. I can't believe that there are people in the world like this.This is s family drama unlike current shows on mainstream TV where coitus is in every sentence. This is different a family show that's is very emotional. Well acted, well written (a bit long). The first episode is a bit confusing as the characters are not clearly explained but stick with it, gets better with each episode.Even if you think you are not an emotional person, it's hard not to be with this show, even the music is touching and I don't even know the words. If you watch this show and don't feel sad along the way then If you are into Korean TV drama I would say that this rates very high among those I have watched, but I have a long list to get through. Although I would rate That Fool at the top of my list.As well the main actress is enough of a reason to watch the show, if you ever wanted to picture an angel she is it. I first saw her in a movie 'Cold Eyes' and I thought she was beautiful. But in this drama she is beyond that. A picture of an Angel with a smile that's warm and sincere.SPOILER ALERT: The show is a bit long seems as though that the writers wanted everyone (main cast) to have some hardship before the end, which is predictable happens. Although the end is a bit different than the other shows that I have watched (in other shows:everyone goes off on their own in the end). This show is different as it brings intertwines all the cast into situations that are semi realistic. But I thought that the witch and the witchette got of way too easy.

Going back to this drama, for me thought the way the step daughter was treated in the end was quite harsh, a bit of compassion wouldn't have come amiss. Mother was a nightmare so can understand the characters turning against her. Was disappointed the daughter didn't end up with the restaurant guy, he's so sweet and lovely. The grandson's character was not very attractive at all, in real life he'd be someone I wouldn't touch with a bargepole! Lol. Well acted by everyone.", "Shining Inheritance was a riches to rags to find yourself drama that was well written and acted. Our heroine is plucky, the stepmother   stepdaughter are quite the evil pair and our male leads, the rich heir (starts spoiled and evolves) and selfless friend, are both worthy of love. The Grandmother, who has the inheritance, shakes up her sheltered spoiled family when she strips them of money to teach them about life. What I liked about the show a) writer So Hyun kyung crafted  episodes of interwoven characters with surprises along the way. His evil characters had nuances. He also wrote the top notch intriguing  Days ( kdrama) that I rate as better than Shining Inheritance. b) male lead Lee Seung gi as heir Hwan, in his first male lead role, whose evolution from spoiled heir to caring person was a joy to watch. I also loved him as the male lead in 's My Girlfriend is Gumiho. c) Yeon Joon seok as autistic brother Go Eun woo was perfect and you rooted for him to be reunited with big sister. d) loved store Manager Lee who was terse but fair and put up with Hwan's initially hostile reluctance to do his job with patient dignity.What I did not like about the show a) this drama was extended by  episodes and you can feel the storyline stretch. I bet is difficult for a writer to revamp during production when a drama is extended because it is garnering great ratings. b) the evil stepmother, while nuanced, grated on me and I tended to skip her scenes to alleviate the irritation. c) multiple hairstyle challenged characters; female lead Go Eun sung mushroom cap pageboy hair bugged me. She looked so much better with the bangs off the face. The Grandmother character had a terrible helmet head gray wig and don't get me started on the factory worker with the gray pageboy wig.", "I enjoyed Brilliant Legacy aka Shining Inheritance very much. It's from  and features a great cast and interesting story. It is available to watch with English subtitles on Instant Netflix.The actor who plays the autistic teen brother was the highlight for me in this series. He was brilliant at showing the inner world of autism. If you have a family member with autism you will definitely be touched by his storyline.The music soundtrack is perfect for this series. I wish American television could produce something as inspiring and compelling as Shining Inheritance or other top notch K dramas I have watched, like I'm Sorry, I Love You,  Days, Autumn Sonata, etc. All we ever get are boring reality shows."], "Sentiment Score": 1.0}, "572": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "341": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["I have been watching Korean series from last  years and I have loved them.

The show has the usual elements of k drama: the rich, good looking chaebol; his cold, antagonistic family; the sassy girl; the love triangle; and the boy gets girl story after overcoming difficulties, but it managed to be so much more.The plot: Do Bong Soon (Park Bo Young) is a woman, who's born with superhuman strength. The Force runs through the female line in her family. It can only be used for good or she can lose her strength forever like her mother did. She loves her father who is a gentle warm character, and her twin brother, Do Bong Ki, who works as a doctor in a hospital. Bong Soon can't find a suitable job, but she wants to be a game developer. There are two other men in her life. One is her childhood friend, Guk Doo, a stern police detective played by Ji Soo. She has a secret crush on him. Also she hides her strength around him, since he claims to have a soft spot for tiny, fragile women, just like Bong Soo seems to be at first sight. The other man is Ahn Min Hyuk (Park Hyung Sik) the lanky, baby faced CEO of AIN SOFTware, a gaming company. One day he witnesses Bong Soon's superpowers against a group of gangsters, and he hires her to be his personal bodyguard to protect him against a mysterious caller, who has been making death threats against him. At the same time a serial kidnapper starts taking tiny, fragile women off the streets. Guk Doo wants to catch him, Bong Soon comes to his aid. Can she help both men to track down the culprits? The Good: this show is a wonderful blend of slapstick comedy, old fashioned romance and a refreshing look at gender roles. First there's a hidden message in the story, that loving a strong woman makes you a better man. It works that way for ages in the Matriarchy that is the Do Dynasty. Second there's a subplot about the young chaebol, who pretends to be gay. This image helps him with free publicity, protects him against unwanted female attention, and last but not least: keeps his lovely Peanut King Kong close by his side without alarming her. He even teases her with his supposed attraction to Guk Doo, saying he has a nice butt. His male secretary really seems to be gay, but not out of the closet yet, and the male office manager is openly gay trying to get his dear master into his nail painted clutches. Also the show makes fun of the Korean Patriarchy: the police office, the youth gang, the gangster mob in the neighborhood, and the patriarch of the chaebol's family, they are all absurdly dysfunctional. The Bad: there aren't many flaws IMO, but tastes differ. I find the romance very sweet, but it could be old fashioned and slow paced to others. The slapstick elements, and multiple use of sound effects, are not everyone's cup of tea, but I liked it. See for example the scene with a drunken Bong Soon urging her boss to 'log out', meaning 'to come out' with the sound effect of a computer logging out. Finally I don't like to see the women molester, but I can understand his impact in this drama.So I give Strong Woman Do Bong Soon a  out of , because I like the story lines, the action, and the actors are well matched.", "I really loved this drama from beginning to end < actors have very well played, we felt their emotions through them the scenario is very well written nothing to say except Bravo < a wonderful team. being an addict of the dramas that made me happy, it made me laugh and cry every time. so thanks to the actors, the director and the whole team.

From the perfect comic timing to mushy romantic scenes to the hints of thriller and suspense it has it all. The lead pair have crackling chemistry even though when the story is not cliche where you get a docile and submissive female lead. Park bo young is super cute and adorable that you certainly fall in love with her. I felt like crying whenever she cried and laughed when she was all happy go lucky. \nAbout the actor Park hyung sik I just loved him from the start to end. He is funny, cute,hot, emotional and have the power to make women dream about a man like him. The way he looks at Bong Soon and caresses her in romantic scenes are so gooey and dreamy that you will fall in love with him. His expressions and emotions whenever Bong soon shows affection towards him are just so so so good that you want to see him even more. I am appreciating it more also because most of the shows doesn't portray the emotions of the male leads so transparently but this show does that and I found it quite amusing.The one thing I did not liked about the show were the side stories and extra humor added by other characters. I had to skip those parts as I found it quite boring and they did not contribute much to the story. I guess the leads were good enough in adding the humor quotient to the show.

She was amazing and should be included as a main role herself.I can't recommend this one easily as it aims to break your heart and is the first korean drama I've seen with a devastatingly sad ending.

Although it's a horror film, Whispering Corridors seems to be a drama at heart. The school building is very atmospheric and eerie, and there's some spooky shots of long corridors and deserted classrooms. Along with that, we also explore the extremely competitive and harsh South Korean education system, identity and reputation, and the relationships between the four students and one teacher.After the suicide of Mrs Park (or 'Old Fox' as she's known amongst the pupils), rumours begin circulating around the school about what caused her death. Girls fall out, and come together; there's a ghost who apparently haunts the old, disused art room, and people aren't who they first appear to be...A thinking man's film indeed, this will have you scratching your head in some parts. Not a lot of blood, but some tense scenes of violence. A chilling atmosphere and setting endures throughout, the director certainly knows how to set a scene. He also gets the best of the cast, who are all exceptional. Mr Oh; aka Mad Dog, is a particular stand out as a vile, abusive teacher. Altogether a very character and theme driven story, with interesting social commentary. If you like slow burn, atmospheric, subtle horror, you'll like this. P.S. There's an intriguing quote towards the end, where a character says It didn't matter who I chose as long as I filled the seats. A comment on the emphasis upon status and reputation in the classroom, and thus, lack of identity? Or a jab at the thought that Asians look really similar? (At least to those from outside Asia.) Or both?", "The look of the murky and desolate school corridors where sunlight cannot reach during the afternoon lessons had always given me the creeps. This movie was on the silver screen while I was in Grade , in Turkey. My friends have gone to see it, yet they were so indisposed afterwards. However couple weeks before its screening, we've seen a Jennifer Love Hewitt flick I Still Know What You Did Last Summer that was when we had finished that horror movie with belly laughs and roll in the aisles. I was curious to see and to know what was not to laugh of somebody's frightening of ghosts. Somehow, even though my friends were irritated of it, Whispering Corridors made a good box office hit in Turkey. It must have inspired some serious masses, that in the first decade of s' Turkish Horror Suspense Fiction have used remarkable pieces from Whispering Corridors whether directly or indirectly. Then Taylan Brothers adapted a low quality copycat from this already adapted adaptation. Making double adaptation for a piece of art didn't make sense on the payoff and the viewer felt it thoroughly. No one ever liked this adaptation; and it remained as a pathetic Turkish version: Okul(). That failure of Turkish cinema made me search for its origin. Yet till yesterday I hadn't have a chance to see this psycho horror.Now watching it for the first time after  years of its release, it's clear to realize that Horror is no Horror if there is no Psycho in it. Whispering Corridors is para psychologically successful and realistic. People know in secret that these types of extra ordinary and super natural happenings do really occur in real life.The story takes place on a country side all girl private school in South Korea, the year . Presumably on a Sunday, the day before the new semester starts, the president of the teachers' committee of the school(Mrs.Parks) is getting killed right after the killer stole the  and  student yearbooks. We  the viewers  get  clues of the killer that she has the capitals P.C. from her desk, she commits her murders barefoot and she carefully leaves no evidence making the murders seem like suicides. After the semester starts, one of the male teachers of the school entrusts a class of girls with a task to hush up the rumours about the suicide among the students of the whole school. For this purpose, every week the committee of teachers choose the clerk for the week out of students of the same class. Meantime, there is a very strict racism storming in the air among the teachers for the student children of the Shaman families. A girl from the chosen class, whose mother is a Shaman priestess, begins getting affected while she used to call spirits to reveal the exam scores before they're announced or reveal whoever is virgin or not among her friends. That way, her friends always show respect to her, frightening of her but loving her at the same time. Soon, we get more clues about the murderer after she kills the night guard of the school. The murderer is very unpredictable, and the best thing is that each time when the mystery takes control on us trying to solve the murders; the murderer is getting killed. So, technically the spirits which curses the school and those students who are cursed each time a new student  were the actual offenders. One by one girls of the chosen class lose their minds and in order to kill their victims they must trade their souls in with the spirits, so that the spirits can manipulate them kill their victims.Technical aspects are very low due to the low budget. Even though the audio quality is considerable. To capture the actors' voices more clearly I don't think the film crew had a boom operator though. The tensioned atmosphere is the true accomplishment of the camera movements, some degree of lighting adjustments, camera locations and chosen angles. Storytelling is very ambitious that despite the editing is mediocre, still the film keeps its fluency. Only watch out for the last  minutes! It becomes a captivity of total paranoia.While I was staring empty minded at the closing credits, witnessed on how easy the deepest emotions of a human heart can destroy everything in one's life; I asked myself how in earth can someone make a movie like that so as to reveal what's unseen of the psychopathic murders. What a brave and hard job! What an amazing concept! If only it could have been produced more attractive to the viewer with a better screening quality, a better acting, a better screenplay, a better editing. The total commitment and self belief of the production crew carries its importance to the highest standards; there we are taught how important the pre production phase of a raw production material which was based on a very widely known and so told school rumour.If producers who are only looking for gaining box office receipts with a horror movie and they hesitate to scratch and scrabble the concept of the fear; then they cannot reflect the reality or it just remains unreasonable as a work of imagination. For Yeogo Goedam didn't fall into this trap, it's a must see cult horror.", "In the haunting opening sequence, we witness the mysterious death of a teacher at a South Korean all girls school. She is discovered by her pupils (her hanging body is a nightmarish image that will tattoo itself on your memory), and their abusive principal tells them it was a suicide. Before she died, she telephoned her young coworker and told her that Jin Ju is here. She's still alive! Baffled by this, the young teacher embarks on an investigation to figure out what exactly is going on at this school. She finds that the ultra competitive students are not what they seem on the surface.In its trailer, Whispering Corridors is credited as being the film that started the Asian Horror Explosion. I'm not so sure about that, as Ringu is far better known and appears to have been released first. However, this truly is an excellent supernatural story that deserves as much recognition. While the movie leans heavily on drama and mystery, the frightening scenes are very effective. Those that take place in the long ominous hallways in the empty school at night, as well as in the condemned art studio, are incredibly creepy and atmospheric.The performances by the entire cast, especially the young actresses, are excellent. Throughout the film, we are introduced to several of the repressed but competitive girls. There's the insecure nerdy girl who believes in magic, her best friend who is desperate to be popular and secretly wants to be an artist, the prettiest girl who is also at the top of the class, and the vicious eyed girl who is second in rank and never utters a word. As the body count increases, the viewer is given several hints as to why each of these girls (as well as the violent and lecherous principal) could be a suspect.The film culminates with a sappy sequence that will likely cause you to eyeroll through it is duration, but it is easy to forgive this melodrama after seeing the chilling final shot of the film. The chronology may be confusing for some (though it is much easier to follow than many Asian supernatural horrors!), but all the sideplots are nicely tied together in the final sequences. What makes Whispering Corridors especially interesting is its strong underlying message of solidarity above competition in young women. Not only was I surprised to find social commentary of this type successfully incorporated into a horror movie, but I was doubly astounded to find it in one from South Korea. Yet, the messages here are especially potent because they are universal. I wish this unique horror film could find a larger audience because it deserves to be seen by more people.My Rating:  ", "Whispering Corridors is a totally scary, and entertaining horror flick from Korea. It's easy to see why this was the first of an explosion of Asian Horror films like the Ring and the Grudge, because the director, Park Ki Hyung is definitely well versed in American horror and uses his understanding of the genre to make the movie really appealing to any American horror fan. Whispering Corridors is the first in a trilogy of films. The first death in the movie and all of the rest are really reminiscent of the slashers like Friday the th and other late 's early 's American horror which are the staples of the genre. If you like horror films and have seen the best ones, you'll immediately see why this one fits right in to that group. What's really cool about it, is that there's no CG (computer generated effects). All of the blood and deaths etc. are all done with real actors, and it's almost more believable than the over the top current American horror genre. There's something so tangible about the blood in the film. It's bright red, and creeps the viewer out in a way that CG children running around (like in the Grudge) could never fully achieve.The whole film takes place around an all girls school   and with girls in uniforms and mysterious murders, you've got the makings of a great horror narrative. The first  minutes really suck you into the story as Ki Hyung moves the camera much like 's DePalma or Hitchcock  It's seductive. The school building becomes horrifying in and of itself. The way Ki Hyung presents the school makes it like an evil edifice similar to the Overlook Hotel in Kubrick's The Shining.The tone is similar to Rosemary's Baby in that the girls are consistently trying to figure out what the problem is they want to get to the bottom of it, but the forces out of their control, i.e. the school teachers, get in their way, and they get in trouble. The grainy look of the film and the way the sound design score are used is totally an homage to the classic horror films of the 's. In the movie, the Korean school system is depicted as an evil force that represses the girls, abuses them, and ultimately is the motivating force that makes the one girl commit suicide and become the ghost who murders her enemies throughout the film. The performances by the girls are great. And the colors of the film are so dreary, that you can't help but feel like you're there. The end of the movie has a really amazing image of the two main girls alone in the classroom with blood pouring out of the walls and the ceiling. Overall, this film is really entertaining, and psychologically interesting, and will scare the crap out of you. The Tartan DVD release is pretty awesome. It has trailers for a lot of Asia Extreme films, . surround sound, photos, and English Spanish subtitles.", "I really didn't expect much going into this film. I think I'd been burned by too many mediocre horror movies featuring ghosties in the past, so to watch one of the grandmamas of the modern Asian ghost girl genre had me bracing for every trite conceit that could be thrown my way. Whispering Corridors surprised me. Rather than really being a flashy story about hauntings and killings, it turns out more to be an exploration of the impact of the brutal South Corean high school system on the youth that attend it, using the horror genre as the medium.First of all, I have to say that I wasn't frightened during this film. Not even for a brief moment. Rather than suspense and thrills, I was hooked into the mystery and dramatic elements that were at play. The way that the story is spun, there's no question as to who the ghost was or why it's doing the haunting, but rather, what the ghost's secret is. Now, astute viewers will pick up in the first few scenes of the film what we're looking for and I even managed to make the correct guess at it  although I really just had to watch to have my guess confirmed.Another interesting aspect of the story is that there are three stories going on. One about an artistic student trying to express herself in a system that cares little for her expression, another about a former student who returns as a teacher trying to make peace with her memories and the last about a student rivalry between a model student and the second rank peer. The strength of this approach is that we anticipate the collision of the separate story lines and are rewarded when they do collide. The weakness of the approach is that the story has to juggle three (well, really two  the third is a B story) protagonists and sometimes seems to suffer from a lack of focus.The film was clearly made in an era of Corean film making that hasn't yet reached its more modern proficiency and the equipment film stock used will have an almost grindhouse direct to video feel to it for those who are only used to modern American European cinema. Nevertheless, while the directing nor acting is spectacular, it is presented sufficiently as not to serve as a detraction from the story.All in all, this is actually a pretty decent film, even if it's not as much of a horror film as I was expecting. The interesting intertwined story lines and the use of horror to explore societal and personal burdens (and with some measure of tact) left me pleasantly surprised with Whispering Corridors. I can't recommend it to all viewers as the aesthetics might turn off those only looking for beautiful films and those looking for scary ghost or gorefests will be horribly disappointed. But this is an interesting look at the Corean high school experience as well as an intriguing mystery. So, recommended to those with open minds and a willingness to look past the genre for the story within.  ."], "Sentiment Score": 0.9780000000000001}, "1120": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "593": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "522": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["Hogu makes women and children feel safe and happy. \nAll men should be like Hogu. \nA man with a heart.

It was a really fresh idea to place zombies during the Korean middle ages(Joseon era) a direct contrast to most zombie films we see today, located at the modern urban landscape. The decision to do that breaths new life to the so far tired zombie genre.Moreover, what I found incredibly interesting is the subtle commentary on the extremely hierarchical korean society, which is the actual disease that has consumed the nation. Look no further than where the disease started (the king is patient ) and the way that the society tries to deal with their dead; seperating the bodies of the rich from those of the poor, giving proper burial to the rich whereas burning the poor. Instead of dealing with the actual situation they choose to focus on formalities even when those can endanger the living. Not only that but the Confucian principles of not harming the body(burning,cutting etc) are only to be applied to the rich. The society is so much plagued with an archaic system of principles and conduct that they fail to see it for what it actually is, the disease itself, in that sense not only the zombies are infected but everyone.Btw no guns and slow zombies in this one like the Walking Dead. Here zombies RUN, no time to waste and the living ones have to use whatever tools they find, mainly tools used in agriculture and farming!In terms of visual aestetics the series looks stunning!

Overall, if you want to see a great romantic comedy with mesmerizing leads this won't fail.", "It's an inspired Korean television production, with an enjoyable romantic plot, well written dialogue, good acting and adequate budget. As of April  it has been streamed more than . billion times and its Asian success is so huge that China's Ministry of Public Security posted an official (and threatening) statement to warn against the growing influence of Korean Dramas on Chinese youth.It's obviously for kids but it can be interesting for anyone willing to know how is it to live now in South Korea, what does it mean to be pretty, young and cool there.But besides that, the story is catching and well made, with pleasant moments, nice sceneries (a great part has been shot in Greece) and good attention for details. Interestingly, Authors felt the need to account for the age difference between the beautiful Song Hye kyo (born ) and the handsome Song Joong ki (born ), even though I wonder how many of us would have noticed\u0085 I'm liking it and I think that others from Western Countries will like it too.", "This drama has a little bit of everything in it: romance, action, adventure, drama, and comedy! I will definitely watch it again. Great storyline, awesome cast, beautiful soundtrack.\nIt couldn't have been more enjoyable!!! Definitely one of my favorites and a fine example for why I love watching Korean drama! Watch it. You won't be disappointed.", "One of the most well written and beautifully shot Korean dramas, amazing and fresh plot and we'll built characters and satisfying ending.one of the best shows and detailed writing work I ever seen in the WORLD.", "The title song was what I heard first, which made me search for 'Descendants of the Sun' and read the plot which didn't have much to offer apart from a usual romance story. The person who showed me the song was speaking very highly of the drama and was even generous enough to provide the episodes. Then I started watching in gratitude mostly and to be honest, I didn't regret that for a moment   but the opposite!'Tae yang eui hoo ye' belongs to the type of drama that carry a simple story but with its emotional scenes, heartwarming music and soft touches makes it remarkable and attaching to a viewer. It has powerful sub plots running alongside and the visuals including the cast as well as the venues are also an eye candy.What I liked the most in the story is not the main love story between Shi Jin 'big boss' and Mo Yeon   'the lady doctor' (although it is also emotionally appealing) but the power struggle and the demanding relationship between Dae Yong and Myeong Joo. I beleive the actors playing those two roles have done more justice to the roles compared to the main duo. But overall the story is empowered and flows nicely with typical lover quarrels and romantic moments placed perfectly between occasional humor and action. Yes you read right, Action ! \nI'm not talking about the Adrenalin rush you might have felt when Myeong Joo's recording was played on loudspeaker which was a much needed breakthrough that came with humor. But there were plenty of military scenes and rescue scenarios I was very happy to watch as a boy. One more reason to drop a star in the rating is the poor budget that the producers have got when they have such nice action scenes which are diluted with careless visual effects and props.But overall this drama is excellent as a love story because it has the perfect blend between pain joy, hope disappointment and expectations reality which is true in a real world love story as well. Yes, there are some over exaggerated moments of romance or maybe action, but it is essential for us to bond with the characters, hope them to do things that we want and to take pleasure in them getting what we want( and occasionally not getting it to break 'our' hearts). It is indeed an emotional roller coaster ride for a spectator and I really liked it. Anybody with a heart , anybody who have loved before can relate to at least one small incident that happens between the couples in the drama and indulge in their own memories   which can be eventually painful   but we embrace that pain with love.The only exceptional and unnatural character developments that I saw are of the rich kid doctor and the unearthly attractive tech mech doc guy. But that is tolerable ~ it's fun. It also had its emotional moments with bitter truths of life   like when the disaster struck power plant worker took a decision about his life, which is a nice touch additional to the romance, comedy and action in the story.So to sum up (+) typical but rich romantic scenes(+) humor that doesn't bore you(+) picturesque backgrounds ( I didn't know Urk was at Greece right till the end :  )(+) last but not the least ~ Awesome music( ) can be improved action scenes( ) a bit more less filler plotsmakes 'Descendants of the Sun' a nice story to watch and a pleasant gift to share.\nPersonally I enjoyed a lot watching the sweet romance and love struggles in a drama   which I thought I might never do again. So I would like to thank the person who shared this beautiful work of art with me for giving me the taste of a locked out world. :)"], "Sentiment Score": 0.9056000000000001}, "89": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "1318": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "456": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "768": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Neutral", "Reviews": "There are no reviews for this drama.", "Sentiment Score": 0.0}, "982": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["I am a huge fan of the Korean historical epics and this one is good but not as good as some of the others I have seen.If you haven't seen any of the others, don't make this your first. Check out Kingdom of wind, Chumong, warrior Baek dong Su and the tree with deep roots. If you have seen a bunch of them and are looking for more, this is worth the time.It tells the story of the rise of the most famous king of Baekje. Baekje was one of the three kingdoms of Korea around  years ago. He transformed them from a small state to a serious player as he attempted to subjugate his neighbors and unify his country. The show takes a long time to get going but once it does, it is enjoyable enough. The casting is a little off in my opinion. The main character is a short fat guy, not what you normally expect for the story's hero. Not that it is massively important but the attention to detail is a little off too. The soldiers armor has noticeable plastic clips a few thousand years before plastic and injection molding were invented. Still, this is better than any of the American made historical epics and any criticism is only because the other Korean shows set the bar so high. The American made Show Marco Polo, for example, was a disgrace in comparison to this. Check it out if you are a fan of this genre. Probably not one with universal appeal IMO."], "Sentiment Score": 1.0}, "243": {"Predicted Sentiment": "Positive", "Reviews": ["Queen for  Days is definitely one of my all time favorite Korean dramas. Everything was so on point: the plot, pace, acting, cinematography, soundtrack, everything! Each episode of this drama ended with a cliffhanger which make the audiences craving for more (until you reach the last episode). Even though this drama is based on the history, I could say that the writer is very genius to deliver the story beautifully. This drama is one of a piece which could not be easily forgotten. For those who are craving for beautiful sad love story, please watch this drama!", "What a beautiful ending!! The directing and acting are so moving. You feel the love that the king and queen have for each other until the last days of their lives together (but apart). The sacrifice the queen made to preserve their lives love and to help the king accomplish his duty as King of Joseon during the  th century. Expertly portrayed through these outstanding actors and actresses. This will be one of my all time favorite drama. Highly recommended it! Park Min Young and Male leads Yeon Woo Jin and Lee Dong Gun are wonderful actors. The chemistry between them is spot on! The writing and directing are phenomenal along with beautiful original sound tracks that will make you laugh, cry, and yearn for the happy ending. All the current scenes and flashbacks were cleverly done.", "I've just finished watching this non English drama and I must admit that It's always gonna be one of my favorite series. the fact that it was based on real story, make it more memorial and tangible to me. I liked the story and the best part was the acting of lead actors especially Dong Gun Lee which portrayed the role of king. I'm truly fascinated by him from first episode.
