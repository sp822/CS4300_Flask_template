Gong Pil officially adopts Ha Myung, now named Dal Po, and places him in the family register as his eldest son.

Dal Po, who is actually a genius, pretends to be dumb (like the real Dal Po) and gets all zeroes in his test scores. With his last place class standing and scruffy, country bumpkin hair, Dal Po is friendless at school while In Ha is the most popular girl. Dal Po secretly likes In Ha, and he is forced to join a televised quiz show at first to prevent an admirer from confessing to her on national TV, then later to protect her from losing a bet.

In reality, Ja Myung Go does not represent the drum but instead, is embodied by the KingÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢s daughter, Princess Ja Myung. Princess Ja Myung and Princess Nak-Rang are born on the same day and time to the same father but different mothers. It is predicted that one princess will become the nationÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢s savior while the other will bring the entire nation down. Using her familyÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢s powerful background, Princess Nak-RangÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢s mother successfully establishes her daughter as the savior princess while Princess Ja Myung, who is branded the princess of destruction, escapes death with the help of her mother and grows up among the common folk. When she learns of her true identity, Princess Ja Myung returns to her Kingdom, resulting in a new wave of internal politics and power struggles. Princess Ja Myung and Prince Hodong of the rival state of Goguryeo fall in love but fate has it that they cannot be together. Princess Nak-Rang, who is also in love with the Prince, willingly gives her nation up to him by destroying her KingdomÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢s mystical war drum.
