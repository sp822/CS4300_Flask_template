5,Pinocchio,"It is 2000, and Ki Ha Myung (Nam Da Reum) is leading a happy life with his parents and older brother Jae Myung (Yoon Kyun Sang), until his father Ki Ho Sang (Jung In Ki), the captain of the firefighting squad, dies in a factory explosion during a rescue attempt along with several of his men. When Ho sang’s body is initially missing, the media sensationalizes the case by scapegoating him. In a battle for ratings, cold and calculating MSC reporter Song Cha Ok (Jin Kyung) alleges that Ho Sang survived the blast, and is currently in hiding because he was responsible for the deaths of his men. This causes the Ki family to become outcasts in their neighborhood and objects of national scorn. Ha Myung’s mother attempts to kill herself and her younger son by jumping off a cliff, and Jae Myung blames their deaths on the media, particularly Cha Ok.But Ha Myung is alive, having been rescued from the water by Choi Gong Pil (Byun Hee Bong), a kindly elderly man who lives on Hyangri Island. Gong Pil, who may either have Alzheimer’s disease or trauma-induced memory loss, believes that Ha Myung is his older son Choi Dal Po, a simpleton who had died thirty years ago. Ha Myung, who has no one else in the world, embraces the deception and treats Gong Pil as his father. Gong Pil officially adopts Ha Myung, now named Dal Po, and places him in the family register as his eldest son. So five months later, when Gong Pil’s younger son Choi Dal Pyung (Shin Jung Geun) moves to the island with his daughter Choi In Ha (Noh Jung Ui), they are flabbergasted to be told by Gong Pil to address a mere boy as their “older brother” and “uncle,” respectively. In Ha has “Pinocchio syndrome,” which causes her to hiccup whenever she tells a lie. She idolizes her mother, and hates living on the island after her parents’ divorce. The fledgling friendship between Dal Po and In Ha is dashed, however, when he learns that In Ha’s mother is none other than Song Cha Ok.Five years later, Dal Po (Lee Jong Suk) and In Ha (Park Shin Hye) are high school seniors and classmates at their small town high school in 2005. Dal Po, who is actually a genius, pretends to be dumb (like the real Dal Po) and gets all zeroes in his test scores. With his last place class standing and scruffy, country bumpkin hair, Dal Po is friendless at school while In Ha is the most popular girl. Dal Po secretly likes In Ha, and he is forced to join a televised quiz show at first to prevent an admirer from confessing to her on national TV, then later to protect her from losing a bet. At the TV studio, he runs into the show producer Hwang Gyo Dong (Lee Pil Mo), who had been a YGN reporter and one of Cha Ok’s rivals, but changed careers after what happened to the Ki family. After seeing Dal Po on TV, and knowing that her Pinocchio syndrome limits her career choices, In Ha decides to become a journalist.In passionate pursuit of the truth, In Ha and Dal Po later become newbie reporters at a current affairs news desk. Among their colleagues are Seo Bum Jo (Kim Young Kwang), who comes from a rich chaebol family, and  Yoon Yoo Rae (Lee Yoo Bi), once an idol sasaeng fan who now uses those obsessive and determined traits in her new job.

6,My Love Eun Dong,"This drama is about a man who has it all, yet is unable to possess the love of a woman he is unable to forget, whom he has been loving for the past 20 years.In the current time of 2015. Top star Ji Eun Ho (Joo Jin Mo) announces one day that he wants to write his autobiography. When he is asked about a woman question, he says he wants to find a woman, his real love, whom he has not been able to forget for the past 20 years.20 years ago (1995), before the use of the artistic name Eun Ho, Park Hyun Soo (Jin Young) has lived an energetic and fiery adolescence. First met a 13 years old young girl who has no parents to take care of her, but was still full of life, joyful and without worries, with a pair of bright and crystal clear eyes – Eun Dong (Lee Ja In). When Hyun Soo looks at Eun Dong, he feels his heart pounding like ‘a mouse is jumping out of his chest’. Unfortunately, before both of them can get to know each other better, they separated.10 years later (2005), Hyun Soo (Baek Sung Hyun) aspires to be an actor but hears comments like ‘Although with good-looks, he has no talent in acting’. One day, he unexpectedly meets Eun Dong (Yoon So Hee) on the street. Having been apart for the past 10 years, without any sense of foreboding, the two of them fell deeply, ardently in love with each other. But once again,, without giving Hyun Soo any reason or warning, Eun Dong disappears without a trace.Another 10 years pass by, in the current time of 2015, Hyun Soo has become Korea’s elite actor using the stage name of Ji Eun Ho, with fortune and fame, and is a man who is envied by many. But, he is also a man who has a vacant and unfulfilled corner in his heart. He keeps thinking, if Eun Dong is living in Korea, there is no way that she has not heard of me, that she would not come and look for me. Perhaps she is already dead. Perhaps she thinks I am not looking for her. Hence, Hyun Soo who has now become Eun Ho, wants to write an autobiography, which will contain the memories of his short and limited time together with Eun Dong. But Eun Ho has never written a book, and never did try or want to write a book. Hence he has been asking the people around him for assistance, and a ghost-writer Jung Eun (Kim Sa Rang) is found. Eun Ho dictates his audio recollection and passes it on to Jung Eun. Jung Eun organizes Eun Ho’s  recordings and begins to write his autobiography. Through Eun Ho’s recordings, Jung Eun gets to hear the love story of Hyun Soo and Eun Dong, and feels as if she is listening to her own story, writing her own story.
