A complete MUST watch for any drama fan that wants some action, mixed in with romance and so much more! It is definitely something i wish i had on DVD to OWN... The acting and character development was actually rather well done albeit cheesy in a moment or two... At times it gave me a laugh, a tear of joy and sadness and a sense of excitement. All keeping me coming back for more and actually wanting to live in such a world.Now the music was pretty good and kept the flow of the story together rather well... but often music samples were overplayed during certain scenes, mainly during action sequences.ALL IN ALL, the series was a complete knockout! If you are looking for action, suspense, mystery, and a little dash of romance then WATCH THIS!!!!! I tend to watch only historical Korean dramas and this one did not disappoint. It relatively short compared to other historical dramas but there is no drag in the storyline. You will fall in love with all the characters and keep on waiting for the truth to be finally revealed.There's not a dull character in here. With the way that the interconnected story arcs are woven into what is ostensibly a pitch perfect action comedy drama trifecta that will hook and won't let go. You won't want to stop watching this one. So many great, colourful characters that are wonderfully acted, and well written. While it may start slow after an action packed first  minutes, the story will soon come to a rolling boil, as you can't wait for the next chapter of this series to watch. Expect some sleepless nights of just one more to quickly happen, should you jump into this series. It may cause some tired, red eyed mornings, but I'll guarantee, they're worth it. Iljimae is just that good.The ending is a bit confusing... but you needn't worry...so if you haven't seen all the drama yet, do not read this...because it will ruin the end, and the hole story! Its is really a awesome drama SBS so watch it ...after seeing it I had to reveal the ending... Iljimae wasn't killed, but in the end you will see that the assassin, stabbed Iljimae with Iljimae's sword, his sword had a dull blade ...remember his sunbae Kang kil had given him a dull blade on his sword and telling him it is not for killing...but to save lives...also no one was ever killed by that sword. The st scene in episode  is after his disappearance at the end of episode  was a fictional story told by the citizens as a way to preserve the history of Iljimae in there hearts, so the bow and arrow wasn't real (hence the invisible cloak he used to enter the building, come on in that day an age an invisible cloak). And if I am not wrong the child in the end of episode  is Dani's son she had with Seo Dol.PS: The Return of Iljimae played by the actor Joo Ji Hoon that broadcasted January  has nothing to do with this Iljimae.

Was a great show until then. Would have given it   if they hadn't made it so obvious that they want the guests to win", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Running Man is a long running Korean variety show that began in  and is still airing today as of this review. It has become extremely popular all across Asia over its roughly  episode run time to date, and, it doesn't take long to see its universal appeal once you start watching it.SPOILERS AHEAD!There's nothing to spoil here; there's no linear story or end goal. More or less, it's just a simple comedy reality variety entertainment game show that airs on a weekly basis. I can't think of any show being televised in the west that's quite like it. It's a bit similar to Amazing Race, but its closest comparison is to other past KTV variety shows; X Man, Family Outing, & Infinite Challenge come to mind for obvious reasons.Basic premise: Seven regular cast members get together with a few different guest stars each week to compete in various missions that result in the loser(s) being embarrassed & or the winner(s) being rewarded. There's a heavy chase tag element to the show, along with a varying array of games, role playing, puzzle solving, and daring challenges. The cast use their wits, bravery, and or intuition in order to come out on top. It's usually very simple and silly stuff, but it does serve as an effective mechanism to deliver some solid entertainment along the way.The cast members are outstanding in their designated roles; they originally consisted of  dudes who were slotted to play various personas within the bigger picture of entertaining viewers. In addition, there's one female cast member who hopped on board, and she is awesome. Other than a few early adjustments, the original cast has mostly remained intact, and they work very well together as whole In order to make this show work. They all have their own successful careers as MC's, actors, singers, rappers, etc., but they all dutifully clock in each Monday morning to play their parts on this show. They really seem to enjoy each other's company as well, and they collectively exude a clear bond as some sort of secondary working family. Search any of the regular cast members if you need more info regarding them and or their specific roles on this show.I've been watching this show regularly since the very first episode. It was raw and had a very limited budget in the beginning, but you could clearly see its potential; it soon found its footing, started ascending the coveted KTV ratings chart, and it has been off and running ever since. It has evolved & diversified over time, namely; several new concept themes were added, and the show has been taken out of its confined late night settings in favor of operating in broad daylight in full view of the public. Otherwise, its basic original premise has mostly remained unchanged.This show doesn't have a fixed script per se, but it is produced and directed in such a way to achieve a desired outcome, so it's not reality by any means. The cast is basically informed as to what needs to be accomplished, then they set out to get the job done while hamming it up in typical KTV variety fashion. If need be, the show is nudged back in the right direction or a new direction, according to what's best for any given episode; fortunately, this is all done with as minimal heavy handedness as possible, so as not to disrupt the overall free flowing feel of the show. There's also a unique balance & symmetry at play with these Korean variety reality shows between directors, cast, crew, guests, production teams, editing dept., etc...Everybody seems to be on the same page to try to achieve what is best for the overall good of the show.There is a lot to like here. The show is packed full of fantastic guest stars on a regular basis, and the way it engages itself with the general public is fascinating to watch play out; normal citizens going about their everyday lives could soon find themselves involved in helping out the cast members accomplish whatever silly mission is at hand for that day. It also serves as sort of a Korean tourism guide and cultural experience; if you were ever planning on visiting Korea, you could literally use this show as your travel itinerary as to where to go and what to do, see, eat, experience, etc.On the down side, the cast (who I dearly love) can be a tad annoying with their antics and clamoring for screen time (particularly the MC, who's otherwise very effective when not acting too much the clown), and it's sometimes hard to make all + minutes of a particular show entertaining when you only have + hours of footage to edit. The show has likely already peaked as well, and it's hard to imagine it getting any better or sustaining its pace; it's simply becoming increasingly difficult to keep the show fresh & I'm not sure how long everyone involved can keep this phenomenon going. Inevitably, all good things must come to an end, but if & or when they ever call it quits, or various cast and or crew members have to move on in life, etc., there is no doubt that this show will have had an incredibly successful run!Summary; this show has been consistently entertaining and often wildly hilarious throughout its duration. Once it finds its rhythm, there are very few episodes that have disappointed in delivering very family friendly fun and entertainment on a weekly basis. If you have not been watching Running Man, you have missed out on one of the best TV shows, from any country, in years.Bottom Line: Don't Walk, Run to watch this show before it's too late!... out of  stars!...

She was absolutely crazy about it at the time it aired, and it was hard not to be interested while listening to her talking about it.I suppose I should mention that I wasn't quite sure about the main leads at first. I watched Park Min Young in two dramas before (City Hunter and Sungkyunkwan Scandal), and although I didn't dislike her, I wouldn't plan to go out of my way to watch her. My first encounter with Ji Chang Wook was when he guested in Running Man, during which although he was handsome, he hardly appeared as attractive.Good for me, I tried to keep being open minded. Apart from letting myself be affected by my friend's suggestion, I also watched a cut from an episode to see the chemistry between the two main leads. It didn't completely convince me, but enough to sense a certain level of their chemistry together   which I actually liked.So at a certain point, I kind of felt it was time and gave it a go. I kept my pace of one episode a day at first, not quite know what to expect. The first struck of emotion for me was in episode , then it bloomed in episode , and from then on it was pretty much an one way street, I couldn't go back anymore. Some days I watched two, or even three episodes at a time. My friend said, Well, that sounds about right.The thing I liked the most about Healer, surprisingly or not at all, was the chemistry between Seo Jung Hoo Park Bong Soo (Ji Chang Wook) and Chae Young Shin (Park Min Young) in the drama. They gave me lots of feels. I forgot them in real life and immersed myself completely into that fantasy world. It was rare since I hadn't been able to totally get into the mood of any Korean dramas as of late, let alone feel the romance and believe it was real. This pair broke the stuffy and frustrating air I was feeling for the past  years about Korean dramas in general. It was lovely, adorable, light, trusting. When you see those two, you simply genuinely want them to be together, not because they went through a lot and they needed to be together just for the sake of it, but because they deserve each other. Whenever I saw them, it made me all light up inside. Fluttering. Happy.Apart from the OTP (one true pairing), it appeared to me that everyone who took part in the project was putting their all in it, and they worked so amazing in harmony together that it also reflected on screen. Both Ji Chang Wook and Park Min Young were passionate about their parts, they gave lots of suggestions and really tried to understand their characters. For Ji Chang Wook's character   Seo Jung Hoo Park Bong Soo, I think we're bound to love him. It was a guy who was strong and intelligent and brave, and at the same time had this dorky and awkward side to social interactions (especially to Young Shin's father) that was super duper cute. For Park Min Young's character   Chae Young Shin, she did this type of character before but for the first time ever, something was different. She had a certain depth and comfort that made it easy and pleasant to watch. It felt like something just clicked. I get annoyed easily with unnecessarily silly and naive characters, but this time I actually liked Chae Young Shin a lot, simply because it wasn't that type. It was true she needed to be protected, yet to me it seemed that you didn't need to be strong all the time. If something was out of your reach and ability, it would be better to leave it to people who could handle it instead of fighting blindly no matter what. What would be wrong with receiving help when needed? Young Shin was brave whenever the situation called for. It led me to believe that the script was written logically after much thought. I'm pretty sure many people will have withdrawal symptoms after watching Healer, so I would recommend you to find what the writer Song Ji Na as well as the assistant writers had to say about it, plus listen to dramabeans podcast about Healer too. Also for the first time since forever, Healer managed to get my brain working on the insights it provided. What a feast.Now when I listen to Healer main theme song, it makes me want to go run through the rooftops. And when the first line in Eternal Love by Michael Learns to Rock turns up, I can't help but agree, yes, It's a beautiful feeling..."}, "411": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1096": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "590": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1336": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "600": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "114": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "Life on Mars has a solid story, however it doesn't really deliver in the end, though the serial killer story was intense at the begining.

Sure, it's not one of the best dramas ever to be made, it's not a   rating all over the board and it's not winning any Oscars or awards of that calibre. However, I think there is some real charm within this. The first few episodes are definitely quite cringy, and I definitely considered dropping it after the first  , however, the middle of the series isn't too bad. If you can make it to around episode , then you can pretty much finish this off without it being too cringe. The last couple of episodes   the last one in particular   were extremely well done. I felt like there could have been more added to the storyline per se, it was all a bit give and take, I think. There was a lot where EXO could have done more with their acting, there was a lot where Gayoung could have toned down Inchul Gal a lot more as well. I don't know where the line was drawn between being way too much and way too little. This isn't to knock the acting at all, don't get me wrong   I think all actors and actresses did really well with what they were given for the show, I think the script and character writing could have just balanced it out a bit more. I keep saying this does have a bit of a cringe factor, and truth is, if the characters had been toned down a notch or toned up a notch then I think that wouldn't have occurred   this is my own personal opinion, I know quite a few people who love it how it is.This is a show that definitely has charms. When I say it has a potential rewatch factor, there are some episodes I will definitely watch again, namely the last three. I wouldn't watch the entire season again, it's too much   especially the first few episodes. The storyline was well written, but again, it all came down to the characters themselves on why I wasn't too keen on this.

This is one of those that carry heavy loads of emotions, which in the midst of doubt, became one of my favorites. Great story line. Very interesting yet frustrating plot.

It talks more about crime, conspiracy, political aspects, bureaucracy and the like with very minimal romance. Sure, there are specks of unintentionally hilarious scenes, but I have no idea about the practices and implementation of laws in S.Korea, so I can't pinpoint things out for discussion.

I expect that it will follow the familiar formula where the leads hate each other at first, are forced to work together despite their personal feelings, and over time learn to respect each other and eventually fall in love.\nThat's not to say that it can't still be a lot of fun; I mean, formulas are formulas because they work. What I like most about this drama at first glance is the casting, and the way all of the characters seem to be people who know who they are and don't try to be what they're not. Yoon yi puts on the stereotypical competent, loyal secretary mask while at work, but in her personal life she's messy, foul mouthed, and slightly annoying even to her friends. Chi won is, of course, her polar opposite: judgmental, overly cautious, rigid, and resistant to any social responsibilities. It's going to be entertaining to watch them clash, mostly because I think that Baek Jin hee and Daniel Choi are nailing their roles so far, fully committing themselves to their characters' wide extremes.\nYoon yi, who is a fun mix of organized and hot mess. I understand the need to be super organized in your work persona, leaving nothing left when it's time to go home. She seems like the kind of person who is good at her job because she's dedicated and driven, but she's also prone to bursts of inadvisable emotion, where she lets her feelings get the best of her and acts out in ways that could be harmful to herself and others. Kicking someone who's showing concern for you, even if you're in a terrible hurry, is pretty awful, and I don't blame Chi won for being disgusted when he witnesses her being insincere at the funeral, then turning around and demanding sincerity from him. Yoon yi may be a competent secretary, but she's driven by her instincts instead of what's right, which is something she's going to need to fix.\nChi won seems to have a very centered (if overly rigid) moral compass, making his lackadaisical attitude towards his job feel very out of character.\nThere's definitely some nepotism going on in this company, though I'm unsure yet exactly where everyone stands. Vice President Do's treatment of Chi won seemed very fatherly, and Yul is obviously not a managing director because he earned the position.

As with other K dramas I've watched, the psychological tensions between honoring one's (undeserving) parents and building an (imperfect) substitute family are at the core of the protagonist's inner conflict.

It has the brain (legal battles) and the brawn (physical fights) element, which is a promising combination if you are into action dramas. The promising plot and conflicts are able to keep the audience engaged through episodes, as they are intriguing enough. However, don't expect the fights to be that epic. There are twists, sure, but some are kind of predictable and forced. The twists are not the kind that could make you clap of awe. Then, as expected from Korean dramas, there is the romantic element. I was worried at first that this would ruin the cool prompt, but luckily, it doesn't, as it only serves as an additional sentimental watching experience. However, one thing does bother me: a clich\u00e9 couple conflict. The female lead character is at odd with the male lead, just because he keeps her in the dark for her own sake, while she instantly jumps into conclusion without considering other reasons behind his action. I'm sorry, but this is just too dumb for a so called lawyer, who is supposedly used to facts and logic. I also notice some details that don't add up, such as the female lead's inability to recognize her own mother when the mother is literally portrayed by the same actress with the only difference is the hair. Sure, the female lead was only a child when the mother left her, but there's a family picture in her father's photo studio, for God's sake! It's just too illogical, let alone since the female lead has always been longing for her mother, which normally would make her keep record of her mother's face. On top of the minor annoyance, the ending is not as epic as expected. It's all resolved just like that, making me question, That's it? Just like that?!\nThis drama is cool, honestly, but it doesn't last long, let alone until the very end. I think this could be mind blowing drama if the conflicts are prepared better.

Luckily, this show is the one that makes the public fall in love more and more after each of its episode.\nInstead of the serious, bleak, and depressing atmosphere that recent South Korean police or detective series such as Signal or Secret Forest, Live is very refreshing, heart warming, and realistic. Just as the title shows us, this series does not heavily focus on police corruption or the police force's long, troubled history of misconduct toward the community it exists to serve. Instead, it paints a vivid, detailed picture of the police's daily struggles and how they overcome those day to day difficulties to fulfill their missions and somehow make their lives less miserable. These cops have to live their lives right, so they can help others live right. Again, this show does contain very optimistic underlying messages.

It's another poor girl meets rich boy Korean melodrama. Korean television will tell this same story over and over again until the end of time, and, lord knows I've seen a crap ton of these shows to say the least. Summary Verdict: this one's not bad.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Ha Ji won plays Gil Ra im; a poor & humble stunt woman trying to make ends meet working in the movie industry. Hyun Bin plays Kim Joo won; a wealthy & arrogant heir to an upscale department store chain. Joo won mistakes Ra im as an actress his famous brother once dated, and as a result, they subsequently meet & spend some time together by accident. Need I even bother expounding?...comedy, romance, drama ensue. You know the format: she's the pretty but tough tomboyish type with no time for nonsense in her life, he's the straight laced rich guy who works hard but has plenty of time for whatever nonsense he wishes. The two meet and he begins to soon fall for her. She's less than impressed with him though, so he's got his work cut out for him. The tried and true staple of K drama loves stories is on full display here; he's constantly presented with a series of arranged dates to meet a future wife from the same ilk as his own family, but he's not interested in this and wants to find his own love. His stature and eligibility means he pursued by an endless supply of suitable beauties, so his ego is a bit unchecked in regards to what a great catch he thinks he is. As such, he is somewhat baffled by the fact that this lower class girl doesn't jump at the chance to be with him, couldn't care less about his standing, and won't give him the time of day. He's also never met any woman quite like this before in his life, and she's pretty easy to look at, so he's more than intrigued smitten determined etc. He therefore decides to use his power and wealth to intrude in her life in order to win her over, which initially backfires of course, until perhaps the  can eventually find some common ground to stand on if this relationship was meant to be.We're rolling right along with the standard fare for this genre over the first half dozen episodes or so; it's workable and kept fairly tight for the most part as the two leads come together bit by bit. It's all pretty much par for the course, then, BAM (SPOILERS); on a mountain biking date one day, the  stray off course and stumble upon a strange old shop & restaurant in the middle of nowhere. While there, they imbibe a magical potion which causes their souls to switch bodies. As such, a whole new layer to the proceedings then comes into play in this series.While this wacky out of nowhere plot aspect of the show may seem absurd (and it is, of course), it does actually work, and, it works quite well. It both helps to break up the status quo for a typical K drama, and, also serves to further benefit the story as well as a whole. These two characters were having a hard time developing a common ground & relationship the old fashioned way, so perhaps they will find love via this mystical method instead. Accordingly, the two opposites come to understand and appreciate each other more by spending time in each other's body life.The twist provides for a great deal of comedy to be mined here, as the CEO dude now has to lead the life of the poor tough girl, and stunt woman girl has to run a company and be subjected to high society pressures. While they've switched bodies, they also each take the opportunity to investigate the other, turn away the other's potential love interests, see each other's friends and siblings half naked, etc. It's all pretty cute. This is not without problems though, as each time it rains, the bodies are switched back and forth; so, there's a chance he might get caught in her body while trying to perform a risky stunt that he's ill prepared for, or she does something unknowingly that puts him in danger due to his health problems, etc.Eventually, the two leads get down to the business of trying to figure out how to stop switching bodies all the time, so they can get back to their normal lives before somebody finds out or something goes horribly wrong. With some help from their friends and family, and with a little luck, perhaps all will work out in the end, and maybe the two leads will be able to find love along the way. The cast all put in acceptable to solid work, and just about all characters are likable enough. Perhaps the best role is that of the CEO's brother; a K pop star known as Oska, who leads a mostly carefree life of luxury when he's not lamenting the loss of his true love that got away. The stunt woman has a huge fan crush on him that comically belies her no nonsense tough girl persona, to the point of her being elated with scoring concert tickets, sleeping in Oska themed socks, etc. And, though Oska competes with his brother to some degree, he mostly serves as an intermediary for the two leads while they work on their budding romance.All in all, this show is pretty solid. It doesn't go on forever (though it could have been trimmed a little), and it's kept pretty lighthearted for the most part; it's mostly a charming comedy romance drama, with little heavy handed evil plot villain schemes. Be prepared for a melodramatic final act though, as this is Korean melodrama after all.Bottom Line:   out of  stars.

Lee's character experiences a profound loss at the hands of Choi's character, and in the process of seeking revenge begins to resemble the man he so hates. The line between victim and aggressor becomes blurred between both characters. This is where the film shines. There is no black and white in I Saw the Devil; the viewer is left with shades of grey.As for the acting, it was all done very well. As I mentioned, Lee and Choi work well together, and all supporting cast members did an excellent job. Choi portrays his character in an incredibly convincing manner, shifting suddenly from calmness to manic anger, but never in a way that feels unnatural or forced. Lee's character is quiet and much less expressive, but he does very well in showing immense amounts of emotion through just his eyes or subtle movements of his body. A memorable performance from them both.As for flaws, the only thing I can think of is the strange, perhaps unrealistic behaviour of the police. Lee is a member of the NIS, and is very skilled when it comes to remaining hidden, but that shouldn't make him untouchable when directly provoking police officers or driving on the wrong side of the street. Still, though, it's a very trivial complaint that isn't worth a deducted point.A confident   from me. If you are comfortable seeing serial murder portrayed realistically, and are able to appreciate more than just gore, please, do yourself a favour and watch this film."}, "1302": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1214": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "574": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1211": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "115": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "From the moment I read the synopsis I knew this was a drama I would LOVE   & I absolutely did!!

They fit together so well it doesn't feel like anything in the story was made up like weird coincidences or odd conversations to skip any possible plot holes.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Oh My Ghost (aka Oh My Ghostess) is a  episode  KTV drama. The story involves a lowly kitchen worker who wants to become a chef, the head chef as the romantic interest, and a ghost who wants to settle her grudge. There's also a murder mystery angle involved.SPOILERS AHEAD!Our story revolves around  young women; one is a lonely restaurant assistant who has a crush on her boss, but is too shy to act on it. She also happens to have the ability to see ghosts, which ain't helping her any in her personal or professional life. The other woman is a ghost who can't find her way to the afterlife because she's resentful that she died a virgin. She can't remember how she died and doesn't really care at first., she's just looking to inhabit any living woman she can in order to lose her virginity so she can finally leave this world. Ghost girl meets living girl and discovers that the chef she has a crush on is one of the few living men who can handle her supernatural sexual powers. Thus, ghost girl plans to quickly enter living girl's body to have sex with this chef in order to satisfy her desires before departing earth forever.What happens here is ghost girl periodically inhabits living girl in order to accomplish her main goal (i.e. getting laid). This creates all kinds of problems for the living girl, as she can't remember anything that occurs when the ghost girl takes over her body. Furthermore, these two women are polar opposites in terms of their personalities; living girl is timid and lethargic, and ghost girl is an aggressive loud mouth. Thus, everyone around living girl now thinks she's suffering from some multiple personality disorder as she switches back & forth from quiet & reserved to boisterous & outgoing (depending on whether her body is being occupied by the ghost girl or not).Unfortunately for ghost girl, this chef she's trying to seduce has old fashioned values and wants to take the slow approach to a relationship. She just wants to hop in the sack with the guy, but he won't acquiesce, and this frustrates her to no end. Left with few options, ghost girl and living girl team up in order to find a solution for each of their separate problems; ghost girl helps living girl blossom as an all around woman and win over the man she likes, and living girl allows ghost girl to continually try to accomplish her goal while also helping her out in other ways. It doesn't take long before these two girls become BFF's while also balancing out each other's personalities.Everything is going according to plan, but problems eventually arise. Ghost girl starts falling in love with the chef over time (which was not her intention), and living girl discovers that ghost girl's grudge may not be related to being a virgin at all. There's also an attractive career woman vying for the chef's affection that must be dealt with, and someone who might be inhabited by an evil spirit that eventually represents your main antagonist on several fronts. From there, it's just a matter of following along with the story to see how everything will play out.As usual, you need to give these K dramas some breathing room to see how they evolve before casting judgement. The first few episodes are a little rocky but the story does settle in quickly, and it's mostly entertaining for the bulk of its run time.There's a lot to like about this story and this show, and it's helped greatly by the performance of the two lead actresses. I'm quite familiar with Park Bo young (who portrays the living girl, and is the main star of the show), and she just kills it in a role that requires her to start out acting on opposite ends of the spectrum and slowly blending them into some middle ground over time. Kim Seul gi plays the ghost girl, and this isn't the first time I've seen her play a bit of a manic character in a supporting role, but she's quite good at it, and somebody needs to give her shot at as a lead actress asap. These two actresses drive this show from start to finish, and they interact so well that you'd think they've been working together for years.Jo Jung suk plays the chef and lead love interest. He's fairly likable and effective (especially when compared to the asshole head chef character portrayed in 'Pasta') and, of course, he's pretty easy on the eyes. The rest of the cast of characters not mentioned above consist of the ghost catcher lady with a soft spot for the ghost girl, an assortment of fit subordinate chef dudes ranging from reasonable to obnoxious and that get shirtless for no reason (other than to obviously appease the female viewers), along with a few others of import.This show utilizes several cooking related segments throughout, and a few ghostly special effects as needed, and while both of these of aspects are employed rather sparsely, they do serve their purpose. Production values are solid enough for this type of show, and it's competently written and directed as well (though you'll have to excuse the lack of rules of what a ghost can or can't do). There is a bit of lag during some of the middle episodes, but not so much that it doesn't comply with my number one rule for any K drama (i.e. Don't Be Boring!).Summary: Is it great?...Of course not!. But there are a number of things to like here. It does ultimately work quite well for what it is, it's also pretty well paced, and there's a nice mix of drama, humor, poignancy, suspense, love, etc. Personally, I thought it was very nicely done!Bottom Line:  out of  stars on the K Drama scale!...Solidly Recommended!"}, "522": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Hogu makes women and children feel safe and happy. \nAll men should be like Hogu. \nA man with a heart.

He would go on to direct A Tale of Two Sisters, The Good, The Bad, the Weird and I Saw the Devil. The Quiet Family is probably most famous for being remade by Takashi Miike a few years later as The Happiness of the Katakuris. Miike's film is far more zany, and it's a ton of fun. Kim's film is probably a little bit better. It doesn't contain any musical numbers, zombies or sequences animated in clay. It's quite well directed, though there are some plot holes and loose threads. Kang ho Song (Thirst, The Host) and Min sik Choi (Oldboy, Failan) are the most recognizable of the five family members who own a remote mountain inn. Their business is doing poorly. After a few weeks, their first customer shows up. He dies. Probably a suicide, but it looks like murder. The family decides to bury them. More bad luck follows as nearly each and every guest who shows up at the inn dies under horrific circumstances. The family just keeps burying the bodies. The film is morbidly hilarious. It kind of gets sloppy around the end, but it's hugely amusing the whole way through. Probably my favorite of Kim's films that I've seen so far", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Maybe this should become my mantra: The property of 'originality' is based not so much on actual properties of the art object in question as it is based on the knowledge of the person ascribing the property to the art object in question. In other words, when we deem an artwork original, it doesn't so much mean that the work _is_ original as it means that we're just not familiar with the works that have had a significant influence on it, or we do not remember the precursors (for those of us with less than perfect memories . . . what was I saying?)The Quiet Family has already had a significant influence on films such as Jaume Balaguer\u00f3's The Darkness (), and it has already been remade, by wacky Japanese director Takashi Miike, as The Happiness of the Katakuris (Katakuri ke no k\u00f4fuku, ). I didn't realize that Happiness of the Katakuris was a remake of this film until I watched Happiness and looked it up on IMDb. I had never heard of this film before. South Korean films do not exactly get a great amount of publicity in the U.S., unfortunately.Unlike Miike's remake, which is a very good film in its own right, The Quiet Family doesn't have bizarre claymation, it's not a musical, there aren't singing and dancing zombie corpses, and there isn't some karmic disturbance of an equivalent to Mt. Fuji. This is a much quieter and understated film, but it's still a black (morbid or macabre) comedy drama about a horrific, bad situation that just keeps getting worse.The story concerns Tae gu Kang, who has bought a small hotel (unlike Happiness of the Katakuris' much simpler bed & breakfast) in a relatively remote hiking area. He moves his family  his wife, son, two daughters and his brother  to the hotel, where they wait for guests to arrive. No one shows up. When they eventually do get a guest, it's a strange, solitary, older man who ends up committing suicide with his hotel key chain. The man's wallet, which seemed to contain a substantial sum of cash, is missing. Worried that the authorities will never believe them that it was a suicide, especially given their son's troubled past, and worried that the situation will create bad publicity for their hotel, they decide to bury the body on their property. Other guests begin trickling in, but for some reason or another, they all meet less than favorable fates. Just how much bad luck will the Kangs have, and just how far will they go to surmount it? Even though this is a morbid comedy, director Ji woon Kim employs very deliberate art house drama pacing and tonalities. The cinematography is interesting throughout, and recurrent motifs include sustained, almost motionless shots of daughter Mi na Kang (Ho kyung Go), who is implied as an emotional center for the family (and indeed, she's the only one who remains relatively even keeled throughout the bizarre occurrences). There are also many slow tracking or zoom shots of the beautifully decorated and colored hallways of the hotel (this is one of the conspicuous influences on the film Darkness, which has similar color and decoration schemes).Another center for the Kangs is mealtime. We see them eating many times throughout the film  it's a way for them to gather their bearings, if possible, and figure out their plan of attack. One nicely symbolic scene shows everyone refraining from eating at the table except for Mi na and her sister Mi su (Yun seong Lee), as the family initially keeps the girls in the dark about the macabre goings on.Kim, who also wrote The Quiet Family in addition to directing, even spoofs the typical art house drama romance, with a man who courts Mi su a little too fervently and of course meets a twisted fate. This sets off a chain of events that lead to a very funny climax.The crux of the film is the ever escalating occurrences and humorous attempts to cover them up. This provides amusing subtexts about how good intentions can lead to severely immoral actions (and the guests even get in on this subtext a bit), but at the same time, we empathize with the protagonists, as the Kangs, at least, may be making bad judgments, but if they don't, they could face worse consequences. This is a quiet family that wants to remain quiet. While I prefer the bizarreness of Happiness of the Katakuris, at least slightly, The Quiet Family is still a very good film, and you just might prefer it if your tastes lean more towards art house dramas than the surreal and over the top."}, "1320": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "338": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "442": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "I loved this drama so mush.Try to watch in first time ;)"}, "272": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "417": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1140": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "753": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1314": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "512": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "853": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1256": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "14": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1199": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "517": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "27": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "The plot and resolution for this would have been acceptable for a movie, but for an entire TV series it's just too much.

I will now commence with my review of this series, and will consider my worldwide community service done for a little while. Story; Private Investigator is hired by a young heiress to find out who killed her family. While investigating, they discover her family left behind some hidden gold that an evil organization is trying to find. Meanwhile, there's a cop who's chasing the PI as the PI is apparently also a wanted criminal. There's a bunch of side characters and sub plots tossed in along the way, and everybody involved eventually tries to find the gold while trying to either capture someone, kill someone, or turn someone into the authorities. It can mostly be considered as an Action Drama.The main problem with this show is that it is both ill conceived and poorly written. It's basically: plot point, fight scene, plot point, chase scene, plot point, repeat ad nauseam. While this may sound like it might be exciting, it most decidedly is not; in fact, it's downright boring. The majority of the fight and chase scenes don't carry any suspense as no one ever seems to get hurt, and if someone gets caught, they just escape in the very next scene anyway. It appears they only had part time makeup artists on set as well, as half the time everybody escapes from a big fight without a single blemish, but are bleeding profusely from the next big fight at other times.There are also many attempts at comedy throughout that fall flat unless you're a  year old. Contrary to what the writers may think, it's not hilarious to see Rain get his ass stuck in some lady's face during car chase scene # . There's also a side character who's another PI in Thailand or the Philippines or somewhere; his name is James Bong (Jeeesh)...he's supposed to be the comic relief I guess, but he's not funny at all, and is one of the most annoying characters you'll ever see on TV, that is until you get a load of his idiotic sidekick.The actors all seem out of place too, and seem mostly disinterested as the show drags on. Who can blame them really? Rain is your lead actor here as the PI; he gives a gallant effort to play along with all the stupidity, but he mostly comes across as a silly goof ball. Daniel Henney is one of the other  male leads. The dialogue he's given to work with is downright painful to listen to, and it's not helped by the fact that he still can't speak Korean. It appears he tries to learn the script in Korean but there apparently wasn't enough time, so he speaks the first few sentences of some conversations in Korean, then he speaks the rest in English. I'm not kidding, that's how ridiculous this show is! The lead actress walks around with an expression on her face that suggests she's wondering how her career sank to this level. I kinda felt bad for the actresses and actors involved, and you can almost tell, at about the midpoint of the show, that they're just clock watching hoping this giant turd they're stuck in will get flushed away soon. The writing and direction teams, however, should all be given a swift kick in the nuts.I think the show had visions of being a lighthearted version of Iris or thereabouts. It's more similar to a lighthearted version of A Man Called God. That show was awful too, but at least it was outrageously awful. Both shows even include an evil dude in a wheelchair who doesn't need a wheelchair. I can only imagine what a veteran actor must be thinking when he reads the script and learns he's no longer crippled:\nVeteran Actor: Ummm, excuse me Mr. Director, I've been in a wheelchair this whole time, and now you want me to get up and just start walking around?\nMr. Director: Yeah, it'll be great. People will love it.\nVeteran Actor: You're an Idiot!This show is just a mess. There's very little (if anything) worthwhile here. There's only one character I even remotely liked and that's the cute girl cop who has a crush on her squad leader. Of course, (SPOILERS) they killed her character off in a ham fisted effort to inject some mandatory melodrama into the story.And, to add insult to injury to every male watching the show (or female if you swing that way), these geniuses decide to (SPOILERS) kill off just about every pretty lady on the show: the cute detective, the hot assistant to Henney's character, the pretty Japanese professor (oh wait, she's not killed, she's just in hiding for a while until she shows back up in what else but a wheelchair. Maybe they only had one wheelchair on set, and that's why the evil dude had to get up out of it, so the professor could sit down), and most egregiously, the PI office assistant with the amazing rack. They don't even bother to kill her, she just completely disappears from the show after a couple episodes without any explanation, and nobody seems to notice or care. I know if I were the PI, I'd be wanting to know where my cleavage bearing assistant is. Look, if they wanted me to watch this pile of garbage, the least they could've done was show me some titties, unfortunately, they couldn't even get that right! Bottom Line: This show sucked and was a complete waste of time. I suggest you watch something, anything, else instead. You'll thank me for it later! out of  stars!", "Highest Sentiment Review": "It is really like that, you dig Korean action drama or you don't. If you do, you may actually enjoy it quite a bit. There is not much logic here, true, and reasons for anything are, at the very best, faintly perceptible. But is not really the point. You have plenty of crazy action, sometimes funny, sometimes silly, occasionally a bit sad. What else do you need? Rain (Ninja Assassin) is really good. He steps into the character with ease, playing a rouge, funny, silly and sometimes surprisingly serious PI, in the very best tradition of the original Lupin III manga series. Lee Na young (Ruler of Your Own World) managed to make her character believable and, trust me, it was not an easy task   see the part about reasons above... :) The supportive crew is really good   Henney being sort of perfect for his character (a dubious honor, but true), and Lee Jung jin and Yoon Jin seo complementing each other perfectly. Special prize should go to Seong Dong il, playing Namkamura Hwang, he is The Nakamura. ;) Martial arts choreography is impressive, although a little bit too smooth for my taste. Korean directors seem to prefer a dance like quality in the fighting scenes and it shows   as usual. Yet I cannot honestly say it is some kind of a setback, just part of K drama experience. ;) I got to really appreciate Lee Na young performance in fighting scenes. She is not an action heroin and it's well worth seeing the special episode () just to see how much work did she put to make it look like it does.

The premise consists of  college aged girls women living together in a rented home while they go about dealing with their lives, loves, families, jobs, and studies. It's a straightforward ensemble drama that will most likely grow on you pretty quickly.SPOILERS AHEAD!Not to stereotype them, but the  girls can basically be best initially summarized as follows:. The sexy girl who's not shy about sleeping around. She cares mostly about herself, her looks, and how she can use those looks and her body to get various guys to be her sugar daddies.. The cute girl who's desperate to be loved but won't be until she can bring herself to break up with her loser boyfriend and find some self esteem & maturity.. The serious girl who works hard to get ahead but can't ever seem to do so. She's had an unfortunate life, but her overly sullen personality isn't helping her in any way.. The fun loving party girl who tries so hard to get a man to like her and see her as a woman, but always ends up getting stuck in the friend zone.. The youngest and newest tenant. She's shy, has never dated, and is mainly concerned with just trying to adapt to the big city college environment and fit in with her new roommates.The girls are mostly somewhat strangers to one another, but they get to know each other over time, bicker some along the way, make up with one another, and generally just learn to get along and support each other as best they can. They do bond together and stick up for their housemates when called for though, and they clearly care for one another, even though they don't always know how to show it or what to do to help one another.Collectively, the  girls make a very nice mix of various personas & personalities, and this is one of the show's best attributes. They are all imperfect creatures for sure, and they each have their own back stories, a secret or two, and reasons why they act the way they do, but this only adds to their appeal as relatable characters, and you'll soon start rooting for all of them to succeed, grow, move on, or whatever it is they are each trying to accomplish.Though not hugely famous film or TV stars as of yet, each of the  primary cast members is VERY good in their assigned roles here, and they consistently work well both together and separately throughout. This is a credit to both them and the director, and this is augmented by the oft smart screen writing throughout the show. Each of the  gets fairly equal screen time and story lines, so don't be fooled into thinking otherwise based on the first episode or two alone (which primarily focuses on the young new girl).Aside from the writing, directing, and acting, one of the other things I really like about this show is its maturity. In a K drama, you don't often see a woman nonchalantly ripping off her bra as soon as she gets home, or someone hoping her comatose brother would just die so she can get out from under medical bills and finally get on with her life, etc...The show was rated for age  or older to watch, and I think that's appropriate, but it has a very mature feel to it compared to most of the K dramas I've seen of this age rating.There are plenty of other things to like with this show as well; in character Q&A epilogues after each episode fit neatly within the concept of the story without seemingly being tacked on for filler or for no reason, the story lines are varied and nicely thought out, the show bounces back and forth between glee, sadness, and a common middle ground with ease, and so on. There's not much in the way of super fancy production values to speak of, but you don't really need them to be in a drama like this, and everything looks fine.The male actors in this show are basically all secondary characters; they do what's required of them well enough when needed within the framework of the overall story lines, but that's all they are there for. There are also several K drama staples, clich\u00e9s, & tropes thrown in as expected; debt collectors, some talk of a ghost, a stalker type guy or two, sick dying dead people, etc...however, none of this takes away from the theme of the show, which is simply watching the  girls continuing their daily lives regardless of any man, side story, or anything else that's taking place around them.Overall, this is a really well done show. Perhaps the best compliment I can pay it is that it never wears out its welcome; the  lead characters, while you may not always like them or their life choices, well, they will be missed. Future KTV programmers, writers, and directors everywhere should take a lesson from this show, and that is: Always Leave the Viewer Wanting More!Summary: I wasn't even planning on watching this because the premise didn't seem to be initially appealing to me. But, I caught a few early episodes, and I was hooked. It's witty, well written, engaging, and efficient. I will take a story like this anytime over the flashier and more popular, yet often predictably unfulfilling, ones that follow the same basic K drama premise time and time again. It probably won't be a big hit with the masses, or crowds that are mostly interested in Cinderella gets doted on by a bunch of rich young hot guys stories, but it is quite good.Bottom Line: Personally, this is my favorite K drama of  to date. I'm giving it  out of  stars accordingly...Totally Recommended!"}, "434": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1120": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1041": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1250": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1127": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "288": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Summary from AsianWiki: Kang Chul Soo (Lee Joon Hyuk) is an enthusiastic fireman.

An heiress, only child who survives after the murder of her parents, is able to remember details from robbery and arson after  years... The boy man, from what she remembers, has a distinctive scar on his back. She goes around hiring male models to sit for sketching, but mainly just to get their shirts off. She finds the guy, who is now a sincere (and hot looking) firefighter and contacts the police officer in charge of her parents' murder case.

Korean TV Drama episodes Late    Early .SPOILERS AHEAD!Be forewarned; I have very few positive things to say about this show. Perhaps if you're a younger viewer, haven't seen very many K dramas, or a huge fan of a particular Girls' Generation member, than this show might work for you. Otherwise, you're probably better off watching something else.Here's your story: A prime minister needs a new wife for himself and a new mother to his  little brats. A young reporter wishes to find a proper man to marry to grant her dying father's wish. The prime minister & young reporter are completely mismatched, yet they are forced to be together for some preposterous reason. Romance, comedy, and melodrama are supposed to ensue as the young reporter slowly wins the hearts & minds of the prime minister & his kids over time.The Prime Minister & I follows a standard blueprint for this genre, but there is very little effort devoted to any creativity here, and therein lies the bulk of this show's problems. Everything about this show is overly formulaic, and it's quite clear this show is just going through the motions right from the get go; the litany of stock clich\u00e9s, plot points, predictable characters, circumstances, etc. are as endless as they are unexpected. As a result, there was never a moment during this show where I was truly engaged with the story itself or anyone involved. As a seasoned K drama viewer, this show did not go over very well with me, and I've seen everything it had to offer done much better in many other shows both past & present.This show doesn't waste any time letting you know how weakly written it's going to be. The dialogue is not particularly bad, but the overall storytelling is quite lacking. They couldn't even think of a proper mechanism to have the two main characters be together in the first place; believe it or not, this is it: A photographer takes some after hours pics of the two leads together. These pics go public, but they aren't really scandalous or even newsworthy, and they could easily be explained away as the innocuous photos they actually were. Instead of simply rectifying the situation, the two leads reason that it would be better to pretend they are dating to avoid a scandal. This subsequently leads to them both agreeing to pretend to be married to further the fa\u00e7ade they've created. The prime minister somehow thinks all of this will help protect and advance his political career, and the reporter girl somehow thinks this is an acceptable way to make her father happy before he dies. Unfortunately, none of this makes any sense whatsoever. I've seen a lot of tenuous motives for two people to be together in K dramas over the years, but this is quite possibly the dumbest one ever; there is no logical reason or benefit for the prime minister to agree to any of this, and the reporter girl's father can hardly even remember who his daughter is (much less determine if she's married or not) thanks to his severe and highly selective bout of Alzheimer's (i.e. he conveniently gets worse or better according to what's useful to the plot at any given time).You're introduced to the secondary cast as the story unfolds; they are the standard jumble of anticipated characters (the annoying kids, the annoying housekeeper, the annoying alternative love interests, the annoying uncle step brother antagonist, etc). Every one of these roles is written as a tired stereotype that's devoid of any range or depth. As a result, I did not care about any of these characters, what their motives or personal problems were, or how their story arcs were progressed & resolved. They were nothing more than mere nuisances and contrivances throughout the story, and were so bland and one dimensional that I couldn't be concerned enough to like or hate any of them.Lethargic storytelling manifests itself throughout this entire show. This is never more evident wherever the secondary love interests are concerned; these  are attracted to the  leads, but their reasons for liking them are never fleshed out in any meaningful or convincing manner. It's as if the writers simply said Here's the designated secondary love interests antagonists because it's mandatory we include them. There is very little romance or comedy to be had in this show either, and both of these aspects rarely hit acceptable marks; what passes for comedy (and often romance for that matter) basically consists of the two leads accidentally falling into each other's arms again and again while trying to avoid some faintly awkward misunderstandings. There are a few early dream sequences that actually had some comedic promise, but this is never fully capitalized on. Ultimately, neither the comedy nor the romance works very well during this show, and the romance angle isn't helped any by the dubious pairing of the two main leads to begin with.Lee Bum Soo plays the prime minister, and Im Yoo Na portrays the reporter girl. He's a veteran of Korean films whose been popping up in KTV dramas more recently, and she's a K Pop star turned actress that's about  years his junior. Needless to say, they aren't really well suited to act opposite each other in a show like this in the first place, and, this does manifest itself on screen...they each do OK by themselves, but the required chemistry between them never quite materializes to help benefit this show.Summary: While not outright terrible, this show simply doesn't work very well as a whole. It lacks too many of the necessary ingredients to be a compelling watch. It's neither romantic enough, intelligent enough, amusing enough, creative enough, or dramatic enough, and, thus not memorable enough.

This is a great show.As my title implies, I'm an old school (and old) rocker from the prior century. The concept of the boy band, when it first appeared in the s with the likes of New Kids on the Block, was an affront to my existence. And I was also somewhat skeptical of the K pop and J pop scenes, and I couldn't imagine that a prettyboy band could be nearly as funny as Spinal Tap with its raw, ridiculous, flat out nuts musicians.

Second in command is Hwang the lead guitarist who is the antithesis of the singer. He is a gentle, wise, friendly Buddha type person who seems better suited for monkhood than a pop band. Bringing up the bottom is Jeremy the drummer. Alas, poor drummers. They are always portrayed as the dimmest tube in the amp, and Jeremy is no exception. So thick that he can barely count to  to bring in the band, Jeremy is a refreshing gust of pure comic relief who balances out the moments of heavy drama (and despite this being a breezy comedy, there can be some heavy moments). And of course there's our hero heroine Go Mi Nam who is exactly the way you'd expect a teenage nun to be, having been forced to masquerade as a boy in the nation's top pop band.That brings me to the plot which you probably know already, but I'll recap: A teenage nun ends up masquerading as a boy in the nation's top pop band. But don't let the simplicity of that premise fool you. At times it gets surprisingly complicated and suspenseful, bringing to mind classic tales like Shakespeare's Twelfth Night which revolve around the hilarity and complexity of cross dressing. And just as powerful as the funny moments, there are also deeply emotional moments which might elicit a tear from even the most hardened heavy metal rocker. OK, I admit I bawled like a baby twice in  episodes. Stop smirking.The overall presentation is cute and family friendly. But at the same time there are gags that appeal to the adults amongst us. In one episode there's a scene involving the girl using ping pong balls to, how do I say... simulate manhood, and it had me choking with laughter for a solid  minutes.I also must say a word about the actual music. I really like it. It's infectious, played well, and the actors even look like they're really playing their instruments. If you're like me, you might be sick of TV & movies where the actors look like they're holding a limp squid rather than a guitar. Well these actors are good enough to fool me.So there you have it, nothing but high praise from me. I'm already sad that it's going to end, but at the same time I imagine this is the kind of show I'd want to watch over & over. Other band based comedies I highly recommend are Swing Girls (Japanese) about a group of misfits teen girls trying to play jazz, A Mighty Wind about a hilarious bunch of freaks playing folk music, Music & Lyrics starring Hugh Grant & Drew Barrymore with some riotous references to s pop, and the aforementioned mofo of all musical movies, This Is Spinal Tap. See them all, and consider it the best music education you'll ever receive."}, "585": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "I cannot even comprehend why they even bothered to making this very terrible drama. The story line is awfully written, the acting of the actors are just not up to what you call pretending to be other people they are not acting more like they are trying to be themselves so the characters in the drama cannot be understood at all, really plastic  faces everywhere (call me racist or whatever the only person in this drama who might not be doing plastic surgery is the only  rd female lead the good friend of the mermaid), low standard and cheap script, bad background music, etc. Call me whatever you want but I prefer natural than a barbie doll face.Basically the plot is a mermaid fairy tale by Hanz Christian Andersen, let's face it we all want the beauty ended with the prince not the supporting friend but this drama tells a different story, mixing the love triangle with the ex girlfriend of the supporting friend whom jealousy got her into mischievous way (easy plot to guess even the ending is predictable). I cannot even watching all episodes because its story is just too tiresome.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Surplus Princess (aka The Idle Mermaid) is a  episode Korean TV drama from late . It's a pre teen oriented Korean TV fairytale type romance drama that you'll probably have to be both very young and very female to enjoy...and, even then, you might not like it. It was supposed to be  episodes, but the viewing public said otherwise and it was called off after  episodes. Obviously, a show that can't fulfill its  episode time slot due to poor ratings is not going to be receiving a glowing review from me!SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: A pretty mermaid has a crush on a handsome human. She hastily drinks a magic potion to become human for a while in order to be with him. Unfortunately, she didn't realize she now has only  days to find her true love before she downed this concoction, lest she disappear from this world forever.This is another K drama that was basically only airing on my TV for the viewing pleasure of my young nieces. It was rated for  years old, and that's basically the age range it caters to. It's not very well done though, due to its relentless predictability, lack of intelligence, and overall immaturity. Perhaps I'm just getting too old to even review a show such as this anymore, but with age comes wisdom, and I can easily recognize when a youthful show of this nature is basically just half assing their way through a lazily written story solely for the sake of watching pretty young people try to find themselves, love, the meaning to their existence, and blah, blah, blah. This show is awash with walking hairdos and abs trying to figure out how to be men, and doe eyed cuties trying to figure out how to become a woman. I have nothing against the main cast, and I actually rather like several of them from their present and previous works. The problem here is all of these performers are too old to be acting as if they're still relationship stunted middle school students (which is frequently how they are portrayed).The immaturity factor cannot be overstated here; the male lead (who's playing a college aged grad or thereabouts, despite the fact that he's roughly  years old in real life) cries at least once in  different episodes (Yes, I counted). I have long since become accustomed to men crying in these K dramas, but that is a % crying ratio per total episodes, and that is simply UNACCEPTABLE! There's also no shortage of scenes where he's generally just sulking or moping around as if he were a petulant child. The female lead mermaid is assigned to play an aegyo factory that fluctuates primarily between elation and despair throughout the production. As expected, this leads to her basically being either super cute, or super annoying, with little room in between. Both characters are likable enough during the few instances where they're acting like normal regular young adults but this (sadly) occurs far too infrequently. Much of the supporting cast suffers the same fate. i.e. there's lots of I'm so sad, now I'm so confused, now I'm so happy approach to storytelling here.This entire dichotomy of having the cast act like pre pubescent teens one minute, then hot young adults the next, just doesn't work very well. This show would have been much better served to either employ a younger cast or be more thoughtfully written to allow the actors & actresses they've hired to be more diverse and well rounded people, and a little more mature overall. Even the older actors & actresses on this show are often subjected to this immaturity, and it is painful to watch.The production values are good enough for a fantasy TV K drama, but the writing just sucks. As an example of this; the dude the mermaid has a crush on suffers from prosopagnosia (which is a disorder where you can't recognize other people's faces), except, sometimes he apparently doesn't suffer from it at all. It's a bizarre and obscure character trait to include to begin with, but worse is the fact that it serves no real purpose to the overall story, and it's occasionally brought up then dropped again several times throughout the show. The lead mermaid character seems more concerned with clubbing, making friends, goofing off, getting a job, and so forth, as opposed to concentrating on NOT DYING within the  day limit she's allotted! Toss in some bad 's American music and entertainment references, an early overuse of post edit screen captions, cast members breaking out selca shots and song & dance routines out of nowhere, pointless brief cameos from K Pop idols (as well as an industry wannabe who has no business being in front of the camera), and on and on it goes.This show is frequently disjointed. and yet it is incredibly predictable at the same time. There were many times where I questioned what the hell was going on, but there was never a doubt regarding who would ultimately be with whom, and what would basically occur to the entire cast of characters over the course of its run time.Summary: I try to be as objectionable and fair in regards to any review I write for these K dramas (regardless of the audience they're aimed at), and I have seen numerous youthfully oriented shows which I've rather enjoyed. But this ain't one of 'em. It has a few worthwhile moments here and there, but not nearly enough of them. As such, I can't recommend this show to anyone (regardless of how old you are)!P.S. My   yr old nieces (and their similarly aged girl friends) ultimately thought this show was just silly nonsense. And, if they thought it was immature (as did I), then your show got some problems!Bottom Line: A very generous  out of  stars, and I'd have a hard time defending even that high of a rating if pressed."}, "180": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "919": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Wonderful show!First,I was delighted by how we are given these characters and they proceed to evolve in the following  episodes none of them stay locked in,they change,as people should.Basically this big company is run by Mrs. Song(Grandma),her son Chairman Cha,her daughter Sook hee Shin, and the two sons Ji heon Cha(Ji Sung) and Mu won Cha(Jaejoong Hero).

This cotton candy show features an amusing foursome that have been friends since high school. I enjoyed the four friends and their bromance and when the show focused on their insecurities and concerns. Each guy was different and grew on you throughout the series. When the show focused on their friendship, it delivered with upfront and sometimes amusing slices of issues of the modern man. The show had charm, and the actors were willing to look silly when the script called for it. Each episode began with a shared experience from their past as friends. It was amusing watching these  something actors pretend to be in high school in some of these flashbacks.Our four friends:a. Do jin was a confidence character that was surprised by love and love that he had to work to earn as his lady of choice initially cared about another of the foursome. There was a great romantic moment when he gave the woman he loved a fabulous pair of shoes and told her to wear them when she was ready to accept him and his love.b. Tae san was the chauvinist, dominating guy who bossed around his sister and lady love but had a sweet side too. His willingness to accept his feisty lady love's priority of her career over marriage showed he did want her happiness.c. Choi Yoon played by Kim Min jong was the widower that was hotly pursued by Tae san's sister  years his junior. His unwillingness to engage in romance with her is understandable though he eventually decides he is ready for love.d. Jung rok was the fluff character of the bunch. Spoiled, womanizing, but with charm and love for his wife. Getting her to believe that he loved her and would stop his womanizing ways was a tough sell.I was less enamored of the women in their lives:. Yi soo was a high school teacher that loved her students and was honest and forthright. She took her time falling for Do jin. I felt the actress over acted sometimes but it was consistent throughout the series, perhaps she was directed to deliver that performance. The character's acceptance of his surprise son from a youthful relationship was good, though this was not horrible in my mind but it was portrayed as a negative and shameful.. Se ra was prickly, viewed other women as rivals not friends, and focused on her golfing career. Initially this character was off putting but grew on me throughout the series.. Min sook was the brittle, tough wife of Jung rok who was mistrustful of her husband due to his past dalliances. This character was tough but caring. I was a fan of this character at the end of the series.. Meari was difficult to watch. Over emoting, tons of ugly crying, and no character growth at all.

The first half I thought was pretty good, until I realized there was still a second half to this. The second half seemed to drag on and I was praying for it to end. The overtime made me frustrated because I thought this was becoming less of a movie and more of a TV series (in terms of length). And than it was over and I realized what an amazing film this was.To keep this short I will tell you that I have directly forced about one hundred people to watch this film. The largest group I forced to watch My sassy girl occurred during two canceled lectures, students were sitting there bored so I popped this in. The class was made up of different social racial gender whatever cross sections. Everyone watched the first half and they showed up and stayed for the final half the following week, some people even came up to tell me how much they liked it. Only  people have given bad responses, one person because he did not finish watching it and the other because she doesn't like watching a film with subtitles.From the rating for this movie it is clear that there are people who hate this film, but if you belong to the other % of the population than you will love it.Why did I like this movie?

The movie was actually more enjoyable the second time around.  ", "Highest Sentiment Review": "*SPOILERS AHEAD*...taken from a reaction paper I wrote for Social Science Class..My Sassy Girl is a  film by Korean director Kwak Jae Yong, formerly known for the straight melodramas he directed. It was based on the novel with the same title, compiled from the journals posted on the Internet by Kim Ho Seok about his relationship with a girl. The film catapulted its lead actress Jeon Ji Hyun and its lead actor Cha Tae Hyun into superstardom. It spawned viewers' interest in romantic comedies, although it was never recognized in the west.My Sassy Girl starts out with Gyeon Woo, a na\u00efve but eccentric  year old college student who doesn't have a clear direction in life. He narrates how his parents raised him like a girl, and how his parents' constantly telling him he was smart caused him to become lazy. His life then becomes intertwined with that of a bizarre girl whom he meets at the subway. She was drunk and wasted when he first saw her, and before passing out at the subway she calls him 'honey'. He was then forced to take responsibility for her, and that night he carried the wasted girl on her back all the way to a nearby motel. Hilarity ensues in the following scenes, as Gyeon Woo and the girl share funny moments together, such as hitting each other on the subway, playing squash (the ball always hitting Gyeon Woo squarely in the face), dancing in the disco with their high school uniforms on, and exchanging shoes (the girl wears sneakers while Gyeon Woo wears heels).The early parts of the film showcase the girl's bizarre attitude. The girl can be seen arguing with strangers, writing synopses of action movies, passing out after drinking three glasses of beer, and hitting Gyeon Woo all the time, telling him 'wanna die?' and using him to get her way. Gyeon Woo, on the other hand, succumbs to all the girl's whims and does everything for her. The first half of the film is filled with pure physical comedy and witty, hilarious sequences.What sets this movie apart from others is how the second half of the film, which consists of pure melodrama, is connected to the first half. The second half explains the girl's bizarre attitude and unfolds all the drama behind the girl's comedic behavior in the first half. Gyeon Woo battles a conflict with himself and finds it hard to let the girl go after 'healing her sorrow'. The latter scenes in the film are so dramatic that it 'turns grown men into crybabies' (quoted from the International Movie Database). Jeon Ji Hyun's acting versatility added to the second half's strong impact on the viewers. A very ingeniously written script turns the laughing audience into a crying one in a short span of time.However sad the second half of the film may be, the 'overtime' part of the film wonderfully concludes all the comedy and drama that unfolded in the preceding two parts. Gyeon woo and the girl go along with the sad fate that befell them, continuing their own lives. The ending (which I will not reveal, for I recommend that people watch it) could be considered as one of the greatest ones in the history of film making. It left no questions unanswered, and it concluded all the subtle hints that the earlier parts gave. It left me, and other members of the audience, laughing in tears.The uncut version of the film lasts  minutes ( hours and  minutes), quite long for a romantic comedy. But it was so craftily and carefully written that one would not notice time ticking by. Every scene in the film gives the viewers something to laugh, cry, or think about. There was no dead air in the story. The cinematography of the film was excellent, for it captured every scene perfectly, also showcasing the beautiful environment of Korea along the way. The soundtrack very much added to the emotion of the film's most significant sequences. George Winston's rendition of 'Pachelbel's Canon in D' invokes a very romantic and joyous feeling that is indeed felt in the scene where Gyeon Woo gives the girl a rose during her class (at an all girls school) while she was playing the piano. Shin Seung Hoon's 'I Believe', the movie's main theme, served its function well as the tear inducer in the most dramatic parts of the film. After watching the movie, only hearing the song brings me to the edge of tears as I remember the saddest parts of the film.Jeon Ji Hyun's acting in the film was very superior. She does very well in portraying the unnamed girl (yes, the girl's name was never mentioned) in the movie. Her very strong charm and acting versatility (she laughs, threatens Gyeon Woo, and cries in one scene) makes the film very appealing, even to grown men who grew up watching action movies. Her performance in this film shoved her into the limelight and made girls want to be like her and made boys want to be with her.Cha Tae Hyun did justice to the role of Gyeon Woo. Just looking at him makes you laugh, and his being punched, slapped and manipulated by the girl is one of the big factors in the film's success as a comedy. His performance in the film made him one of Korea's 'most wanted dates', according to a survey on Korean girls.Some of the very notable characteristics that I found in the film were: .) It had no kissing scenes; .) The girl's name was never mentioned, although she played the biggest part in the film, and .) There were no 'I love you' lines in the entirety of the film.After watching the uncut version of the film, I saw tears in the eyes of most people in the audience. I could most probably say the movie has been successful in moving its viewers.Jeon Ji Hyun won the  Grand Bell Best Actress Award for her performance in this film. Cha Tae Hyun won Best New Actor at the  Korean Oscars for his performance in this film. My Sassy Girl was number one at the box office for six straight weeks in Korea and sold over , tickets per day in Hong Kong at the time of its release in . It was the second highest grosser of that year (accumulating more box office loot than SHREK, HARRY POTTER or LORD OF THE RINGS). It was the Best Asian Film at the nd Annual Hong Kong Film Awards. Just this year, Dreamworks (an American film company) has been planning for a Hollywood remake of this film. How great could this film get? My Sassy Girl is a film close to my heart. It is not only a lighthearted comedy that delves into the culture and behavior of Asian teenagers. This movie shows that there are so many different ways of expressing your love without saying 'I love you'. It is a movie that proves 'fate is building a bridge of chance for the one you love'."}, "706": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1251": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1321": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1226": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1203": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "207": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "I absolutely LOVED this k drama!!!

Ninja films are often criticized for being a little too light on story lines in favor of packing them full of action. Warrior Baek Dong Su takes the time to develop the characters and a very intricate but fascinating plot. Part of it is loosely based on a historical figure of the same name. The rest is made up to make it, well, good. It is still packed with action from the first episode, all the way through to an amazing finally. At a high level,  boys grow up together. One becomes the best swordsman in Korea (which makes them the best in the universe according to Koreans). The other, is secretly part of an organization of assassins called the black Ninjas. He grows up to become the best assassin in Korea (also universe). They kinda fall out when Baek Dong Su finds out about his friends job. The assassin goes on to get involved in a plot to overthrow the king while the main guy (Baek Dong Su), leads the effort to stop them. There are tons of great characters. Only Koreans have names like God of Swordsmanship and address each other like that. If you like Ninjas, you will love this. The rest of you will probably dismiss this show as weird foreign nonsense which is a shame. If you can get past that part, you will probably enjoy it too."}, "750": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "This was my first Korean Rom com . It's very intelligently written love triangle centering around a introvert girl .It's drags at times towards the last few episodes but that's a minor fault . for the major part , it's a very tight comedy which will end up you teaching a lot . I love quotes by the girl where she summaries what's going on in a very beautiful way in almost every episode . I felt they are kinda a profound or may be it's just my first Rom com :) . the shows doesn't bores you with a lot of fillers or drags , other support cast in the series are quite good and keep the interest ongoing", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Flower Boy Next Door is a  Korean comedy romance drama series. It's the rd installment in the Flower Boy series and, like the other shows before it, it is extremely light in tone. You'd be hard pressed to think of too many other K dramas that are softer than this one is.SPOILERS AHEAD!First off, this show has nothing to do with flowers; flower boy is a Korean idiomatic expression that essentially means pretty boy. Our story begins by introducing the titular flower boy to the primary character (Go Dok Mi); Dok Mi is the shy shut in type girl who has a crush on the handsome young doctor she watches in the building across from hers. Dok Mi is perfectly content living alone in her apartment and interacting with no one; unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately, as the case may eventually be), Dok Mi's neighbors are an odd collection of outgoing personalities that become increasingly harder for her to avoid. The most prominent of these neighbors is the character named Enrique. He's the flower boy that catches Dok Mi spying on his doctor cousin, soon realizes she's a lost & lonely soul, and takes it upon himself to bring Dok Mi out of her shell and into the world around her. Actually, all the male neighbors are flower boys to some degree, but Enrique is the most flowery.Dok Mi is the way she is because of something that happened to her back in high school that made her not trust people and withdraw from society. Having a crappy high school experience doesn't really rank all that high on the life problem scale in the long run; when you're in high school though, or not far removed, there is nothing of greater importance than NOT having a crappy experience at that stage of your life, and, that's what we have here; a young woman who just can't get over her past and move on with her adult life.Park Shin Hye plays Dok Mi. She's pretty effective at portraying the perpetually weary sad eyed introvert who slowly begins to overcome her fears wounds as the series progresses. She gets the job done about as well as can be expected of what's asked of her. Yoon Si Yoon plays Enrique; the young and playful expatriate who has nothing better to do than dote on Dok Mi while he's back in Korea; he gives a nice enough performance as the relentlessly positive and energetic pretty boy who simply wants to help Dok Mi, but soon finds himself falling in love with her instead.The two secondary M F parts involve the guy that lives next to Dok Mi, and Dok Mi's former high school girlfriend. He's had a crush on Dok Mi for some time, but he's never been able to approach her in order to get close to her. It's an indication of how light this show is that neither he nor Enrique really even compete for Dok Mi via expected methods. Dok Mi's former schoolmate is the only antagonist here, but she barely even qualifies as one, as she and her gaggle of cohorts are about as bothersome as a litter of hungry kittens. She's a scheming spoiled brat of course, and she was rotten to Dok Mi back in school, but she's mostly pretty harmless overall. There are a number of small side stories as well (involving the kooky webtoon editor, the security guard, neighbors, etc). These side stories are mostly played for comedic & or romantic effect, and, they work well enough to serve as a compliment to the main story line.This show skews VERY young; the cast is packed full of attractive young people dealing with young people problems. This show is also frequently silly and sickeningly sweet, and the melodrama is so inconsequential in the scheme of things; nobody's dying, nobody will lose everything, nobody's family is at stake, etc. It's more of the I'm sorry your feelings were hurt, so here's some ice cream type melodrama. It's an effective series though that's fairly well written, performances are solid throughout, and it's well paced and nicely scored with an appropriately cutesy soundtrack, etc. There's not a whole lot of meat on its bones, and, it may contain the least amount of masculinity in any K drama I've ever seen (and that's saying something), but otherwise, there's really not much to dislike here.On the down side, there were two minor sub plots that didn't work very well; one involves the guy living next door having a secret rich family, and the other involves Enrique's troublemaking fan club. The former story was pointless and unnecessary, and the latter had too much importance placed on it. I also wasn't really fond of the way Dok Mi's suitors came across as borderline stalkers on occasion, who were blindly insistent that Dok Mi was in need of their help, when in fact, they had just as much growing up to do as she did; that was really the whole point of the show though (i.e. these guys help Dok Mi heal over time while she serves as the impetus for everybody to find out more about themselves, move forward in life, discover love, etc).Through it all, this show is consistently funny and charming, and, its biggest attribute is that it never loses sight of the fact that this is where its heart lies. The other thing going for this series is that it's sixteen  minute episodes, and I love this format because it results in very little time for filler or dragging things out, and everything's usually pretty snappy as a result. Get in, get out, move on to the next scene, episode, series, etc. I wish more K dramas utilized this format actually.Bottom Line: This is an adorable little show with a simple and approachable story, and, it's often quite good!...As a bonus, it's also easy to watch ignore while pretending you don't like it (in case you're too manly or mature to admit as much).Nicely done overall!... out of  stars!"}, "280": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "A mini drama part of a bigger project, that started really strong, but failed to give a satisfying ending. The concept of this drama is very clever and original: a girl grim reaper, who used to be a fan girl for a famous singer, is trying to keep her idol alive. During the process she interferes with life and death matters and is sent back to life with a number of wishes she can use in order to save the singer. However, when the wishes are finished, she has to return back to the unliving. So, the first episodes were really good. They were funny and cute and the romance was exiting. Towards the middle, the romance started to develop, and it was a nice romantic story, but the ending was really confusing, at least for me, and felt like they were wrapping things up for the next story. I wish they had explained what happened more. Also, the jump forward seven years later didn't felt like it, and, honestly, it was like some of the chemistry between the couple vanished.

I'll try my best not to be biased ;)This drama is undoubtedly the best short drama I've ever watch alongside with Splash Splash Love (they are directed and written by the same person, Kim Ji Hyun). At first, I watch this because I know Suho, and I think it will be just the same typically story written drama that I have watched. First of all, the casts are perfect and I especially love the girl main character. She can deliver her emotions so well, and I'm surprised because I haven't seen her drama films before (maybe she's not famous). And I love her expression, it's natural and not forced. A rare thing in drama world. Second, the storyline\u200b is so well written. I keep questioning what happened and what will happen while watching this drama, and I found myself in awe as the story unfolds. And they're not leaving e ve ry sing le detail. Third, it's a fantasy drama but it feels realistic! Why? Because the story writer makes it so that it feels realistic. For an example, a die hard fans can really relate to the girls main character (grim reaper), right? Fourth, the soundtrack choices in this drama is on point. It's not cheesy and distracting (sometimes people will remember the ost more than the scene because it's playing excessively).\u200b These soundtrack also helps to deliver the emotions. Overall it's a very touching drama, and it has many life lessons in it. For you who haven't watched this drama, what are you waiting for? :)ps.

I've been following Joo  Hyuk Nam since Cheese in the Trap and was very glad to see him at Scarlet Heart. Needless to say that I was programmed to watch this series.Bok Joo is one of the female characters that I came to like right away, in HIGH contrast with the crazy Baek In Ha which was a bit annoying. Sung Kyung was a real and wonderful surprise in this simple character about a weight lifting athlete who is supposed to be big and not so pretty. Jung Joon Hyung is the swimmer who recognizes her (actually her first love) and becomes very close to her in a friendly way. What happens after is the best.A beautiful couple relationship develops after Bok Joo has her a broken heart after her first crush. And this is where the bar for a boyfriend raises to a new level. Joon Hyung becomes the dream boyfriend any woman should aim for. All their scenes together look so natural and yes, that look that Bok Joo receives will be always remembered. The rest is also naive and sweet. Such a massive change from the all violence sex boring US shows. I've laughed like I haven't done in years of US European shows. And probably I've re discovered the tenderness a TV program can portray (with other values as friendship, family value, commitment to achieve a goal, overcoming obstacles) without the need to use all the clich\u00e9s I've mentioned.Watch it and relax, you'll come to treasure this couple."}, "1133": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "For people who have become sick of trying to find anything new to watch on cable TV recently or gotten board waiting  weeks in between episodes, it may be time to broaden your horizons with some of the amazing shows made by other countries. I watched The kingdom of the Winds (I am sure the title sounded better in its original language) on Drama Fever recently. Drama Fever brings top TV shows from around the world but mainly ones that are translated from Korean or Spanish. There are tons of gems on there and this is one of them. Korean TV has a huge and growing fan base around the world and with good reason, it's awesome!The Kingdom of the Winds follows the story of one of the great kings from one of the countries in what eventually became Korea. It starts from when he was abandoned as a baby (because of a dire prophecy about what he would do when he grew up), to when he had finally overcome the considerable odds to become a great king and takes over a bunch of other countries.Many of the shows that focus on early Korean history, are about the desire of the king to unify all of Korea. Like many countries, Korea used to be made up of a bunch of smaller kingdoms, which meant they all lived with the threat of being taken over by one of the other countries. The king who eventually unifies the country, would be remembered for a thousand years and let his people live in safety. A nice idea, except they all had that idea, so they seemed to live in perpetual war. This show is set in the early part of Korean history, fairly close to the time when the Romans were nailing a bloke called Jesus to wooden cross elsewhere in the world. This is a time when wars were waged with swords and arrows, which makes for great action sequences and fun TV.For the first half of the series, the shows star doesn't even know he is a prince, which gives him the opportunity to join the army as a regular soldier, learn to be a ninja and pick up loads of loyal lowly friends, who go on to become his loyal subjects when the truth about his identity is discovered. Slight rewind, yes, I said ninja. That term we use for men wearing cool suits, with martial arts skills we envy, doing secret nighttime missions in black masks. It seems that Koreans have their own version, as it is not the first Korean show I have seen which features them. In this show, they don't specifically refer to them as ninjas, but they look and act like them. Their secret group is called the black shadows, which sounds like the name of a ninja clan too. They are trained to posses super human fighting skills and they conduct missions at night wearing all black, with face masks. This ninja like group features heavily all the way through the series. They belong to an enemy country and the star of the show is captured by them. After they have tortured him for a while, he ends up joining them for a bit. In fact, just long enough to learn their fighting skills, before seeing the error of his ways and taking his new skills back home. His ninja skills makes him a compelling option to become crown prince in his home country. The perfect hero of the people   a royal prince, but one who is in touch with the common man, has experienced battle from the front line and has led a hard life, which gives him a level of resolve that eludes his girlie little brother. At first, his dad (the current king), doesn't know who he is. When his identity is discovered, he won't accept him (due to the prophecy about his future). Eventually, he wins him and everyone else over with his valiant acts and is proclaimed crown prince. Once the star has become king, the enemy continues to send its ninja like black shadows to try an assassinate him or kidnap his girlfriend (who happens to be an enemy princess). Having a history of being a black shadow himself, who better than our king to come up with a strategy to stop them? Like most of the Korean dramas I have watched, this show is great because of the variety of interesting characters, their complicated love interests, friendships and betrayals etc. They really take the time to develop each roll to the point where you feel like you know them.I have tried to be a little vague on the story as I don't want to ruin it for anyone and I don't like reviews where people try to write the book of the movie. All we really want to know from a review, is, should I watch it or not? The answer here is yes, for fans of actions movies, anything to do with martial arts or ninjas and fans of drama or history. It is also a good one to watch with the Mrs, as it satisfies our craving for action, and gives them the drama and love story that they need to stay interested. The action sequences are cool but not too gruesome, Now, for those of you who are afraid of subtitles and say things like I can't be bothered to read now, I just want to relax, stop being lazy! You are missing out on loads of amazing shows. You get used to subtitles after a while and it is really no problem.

Cinderella's Sister (aka Cinderella's Stepsister) is a melodramatic cryathon that aired on Korean TV a year or two ago. For anybody who's not familiar with this genre, it's basically just a soap opera with a set run time and (hopefully) an end goal. There are loads of Korean dramas like this, and, well my Korean girlfriend (God bless her) really likes this stuff and wants me to watch with her, so yeah, I watched this whole series!SPOILERS AHEAD!Your basic story: Widowed winery owner with young carefree princess daughter meets unprivileged widow with standoffish evil stepsister daughter. Widower and widow soon get married. Widow is more or less just looking to cease going from one loser relationship to another, and she succeeds in accomplishing this by wedding the winery owner. As a result, their daughters are thrust together and are mostly left to get along as newly anointed sisters.For the first  episodes or so, the story focuses on the  families getting together, at which time the daughters are  year old high school girls. The daughters clash from the beginning, even though the widower's daughter tries her best to welcome her new step sister with open arms. The widower's daughter is bubbly, sheltered, and a little annoying, but she's kind and doesn't mean any harm. On the other hand, the widow's daughter is an abrasive ass; yeah, she's had a tough life to date, but the amount of undeserved vitriol she spews on her newfound sister makes you not want to like her character at all. Both girls have a crush on some older dude who's working at the winery. Eventually, this dude falls in love with the widow's daughter, but ends up leaving the winery before love can blossom between the two. He doesn't really want to leave his new love though, so he does so via perhaps the most unmanly and idiotic scapegoat way possible; instead of just telling the girl he loves her and wants to be with her, he sneaks off to board a train without any notice, and gives a letter (written in Spanish no less) to the widower's daughter to pass along to her sister, which basically begs the widow's daughter to come stop him from leaving if she loves him. And, he does this knowing the two stepsisters hate each other at this point, and that the widower's daughter is still in love with him, and not to mention the fact the widow's daughter is just learning Spanish. WTF???...This is our hero???...If I tried this nonsense in real life, I'd either get laughed at or ignored, and probably both.The series then skips forward to when the daughters are in their early twenties, and, goes forward from there as all the main characters eventually re converge. Dude who took the train out of town shows back up in the sisters lives, and they all have to eventually work together to save the winery. Dude is still upset that widow's daughter didn't stop him from leaving when they were younger. Perhaps he should have been more direct or used a better method years ago, or maybe tried to call or write his love sometime during the  years he was away. Idiot!The rest of the series pretty much goes as follows: love work family related problems crop up, the characters cry yell do something absurd, melodramatic happy romantic music ensues, issues are resolved, then repeat until the story arc is completed. In the meantime, everyone stares off into the distance, and reminisces A LOT! There's also many misunderstandings and wild changes in character's demeanors as events unfold, people faint or die upon hearing bad shocking news, there's about a billion instances of someone grabbing another person's arm as they're about to walk away, buckets of tears are shed, and of course, there's always some evil person(s) company behind the scenes, and (perhaps) ulterior motives among all the main characters, etc.This show really tested my limits I rolled my eyes often at the heavy formulaic melodrama involved here (my GF was not pleased with this!). That being disclosed, I did kinda like this show overall in some strange sort of way, and there's a good bit to like here; both lead actresses gave solid performances throughout, although I could barely tolerate the stepsister character most of the time. The widower was perhaps those most fair and stand up character I've ever seen in any Korean melodrama. And, it was good to see the  sisters grow some over time and eventually come to an understanding, which led to a nice touching moment in the finale. Also, I generally felt bad for the widower's daughter who mostly got crapped on by just about everybody throughout the entire series.As for the male leads, Chun Jung Myung did what he was asked quite well, but his character was not very likable either, although it should be noted that he and the often unlikeable stepsister seemed a perfect match for one another. As for Taecyeon; he has a nice body for the ladies to drool over, but his acting is questionable at best. In his defense though, he's given nothing to do other than follow the stepsister around like a sickly puppy or overhear random conversations for the sake of advancing plot points.I may have liked this story if it were streamlined into a shorter miniseries format and it cut down on the nonsense some. But, if drawn out to a longer format (with no end in sight), I might have faked my own death in order to avoid watching it. However, I do like this KTV method of airing shows for a specific number of episodes, then moving on to the next show.

The only reason I kept watching this train wreck is because the ludicrous story line and plot twists are just unbelievably hilarious.SPOILERS AHEAD!This show revolves around an orphaned boy who grows up seeking vengeance on the men who murdered his parents. While growing up, he becomes super rich and super skilled at all methods of mortal combat in order to get the revenge he deserves. As an adult, he goes by  different names; let's just call him 'God' shall we. He's supposed to be the super suave and smart man that can do no wrong, has it all, makes all the ladies swoon, etc. The only problem with this is the guy that plays him (don't know what his name is and don't care), well, he sucks as an actor (at least based on this show). He's supposed to be the strong and silent type of leading man, but instead comes across as a dim witted lunatic who often can't form complete sentences.God is also a legendary international assassin. How he has time to do this, while plotting revenge, training in deadly arts, pleasing the ladies, and running a billion dollar corporation, is beyond me, particularly so when it's obvious he spends most of his time styling his ridiculous hairdos. And, what is the international code name of this legendary killer? Of course, it's Peter Pan!...Brilliant!...I would have been reluctantly OK with this if it were just a throw away nickname, but, everybody in this series references it constantly'God' is Peter Pan?...Peter Pan is coming to get me?...Peter Pan is doing what?, etc. It's simultaneously irritating and comical.The rest of the plot is an absolute mess; there are  girls in love with 'God' (despite the fact that he's a douche and a mass murderer with a severe multiple personality disorder). One of these girls is first loyal to 'God', then disloyal, then repeat. The second girl is irrelevant to the plot and is purely there for eye candy (she does have really nice legs though). The third girl is some wide eyed reporter who gets in the way of the revenge plot, and becomes the main love interest throughout this show; her and 'God somehow fall in love (which is absurd because they have absolutely nothing in common and zero chemistry). Her character is as dumb as a rock, and became more useless and annoying as this series dragged on.The best storyline involves the girl who wants to catch 'God'. She's a detective that was raised by a single father. Unbeknownst to her, she's also adopted, and is 'God's' younger sister. Her father was actually the henchman who worked for the dudes that murdered 'God's' parents years ago. The father was supposed to kill 'God's' entire family, but decided to save young 'God', and his sister, at the last second. Young 'God' was sent to an orphanage, and the father took 'God's' sister to replace his own dying daughter. 'God's' sister (who 'God' thought was dead), eventually grows up to be the detective who's hunting 'God'. The father considers revealing the truth years later, but he can't cause the main dude hunting 'God' glued his lips shut, killed him, and framed 'God' for the murder, so the detective ('God's' sister) would hunt and kill 'God'.This detective sister plot is absurd enough as it is, but why stop there?...The illegitimate daughter of one of the evil dudes 'God' is chasing happens to be the same dingbat reporter that 'God' loves, which technically makes the eye candy girl her biological sister. The main dude hunting 'God' (it should be noted that he's an even worse actor than the lead character, if that's possible) is the son of one of the other evil dudes who's bound to a wheelchair, and he also happens to be in love with the reporter. The brother of the eye candy girl is in love with loyal disloyal girl, who's still in love with 'God', etc. This type of nonsense literally never ends!This show is breathtakingly out of control. I'm continually amazed at how many outrageous things this show can come up with; need a contract killer of the week?...bring in the guy that fights with a whip and poisonous add on nails, or the Geisha ninja, or the secretary self defense expert, or Pascal from Vegas (don't ask). Need the main love interest to reminisce about being with 'God'?...let's film her longingly looking at still production photos during their happy times together (nobody will notice that she couldn't possibly have these photos unless they were actually provided to her by the production team). Also, every main character involved with this show has endless chances to easily accomplish their goals, but they can't because they over complicate everything, make really bad decisions, and are just too stupid in general. And, on and on it goes! This show is so bad that I wouldn't have been surprised if the wheelchair bound dude stood up at some point to prance around a board meeting like a deranged Jiminy Cricket...Oh wait, that actually happens!Bottom Line: this show is unbelievably BAD! But, it's almost worth watching to see how bad it is. Almost! On a scale of  to , it gets  point to start with (because everything is worth something),  point for the abundant pretty ladies, and  point for the comically unintentional absurdity of it all. It gets no points for story, script, pacing, plot, writing, direction, acting.Final score:  out of , and, I think that's being kind. Watch this at your own risk!", "Highest Sentiment Review": "The best thing about this show was the story kept moving along, not as many filler dead spots as most Asian dramas. The bad guys and good guys are always coming up with new ways to win. Many Asian dramas have long periods where nothing much happens.I'm reviewing this in comparison to other Asian dramas, it would not rate as high compared with Western dramas. The fights, reasoning, effects, etc. are a little low when compared with Western dramas. And, I did have to get past the braided mullet that the protagonist wears for most of the show, maybe a thing in Korea in ?I thought the ending was weak, which is very common for Asian dramas. Poor endings make it look like the writers and cast were suddenly told they had one episode left to wrap everything up with half the normal budget. Often, there is never a denouement following the climax.Overall I enjoyed it more than most Asian dramas, which I generally find a slow moving. But, I mostly watch Chinese dramas because I speak Chinese."}, "469": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Overall, it is a decent show with a good cast. There are however some annoyances I have had while watching this show.Plot:\nThe show felt directionless, with no clear plan or goal. Characters were bouncing from one idea to the next to defeat Gwi almost every episode which some might argue was intentional but it certainly left me feeling as if the script was written on the day of shooting.<  Spoiler> The show suffered several plot holes, the largest of which occured near the end of the series, with the Sung Yoel, the Scholar, deciding not to kill Gwi with seemingly no reason other than to drag the show to  episodes long. This could reflect a lack of planning of events in the writing process. <Spoiler  >The lack of story progression is also an issue especially poignant in the first  episodes, whereby the trope of Sung Yoel saving Yang Sun and giving her blood is repeated  times or more. Rather than a build up to the climax, the story spends its first few episodes following Sung Yoel to and fro his residence saving Yang Sun from danger at the very last moment time and time again.Although quite uninteresting, it is not lost on me that the introductory episodes helped to establish a level of intimacy and romance between Yang Sun and Sung Yoel, which compels the viewer to sympathise with Sung Yoel's background and identity and his sacrifice. The role reversal between Yang Sun and Sung Yoel in the later episodes (whereby it is Yang Sun who constantly finds herself bringing the injured Sung Yoel back to his residence and even offering him her blood) is somewhat touching and commendable from a literary standpoint. Furthermore, by drawing a parallel between Sung Yoel's dead lover and his current one, the film highlights the conflict between man and beast internally and this too is also compelling.Finally, aside from the relationship of the main protagonist, no other felt moving or even genuine. Case in point, the relationship between the Queen and the Crown Prince was set up as an arranged marriage and the Queen was given no prior characterisation aside from her hatred towards her Father. Yet, the script attempts to convince the audience that their relationship was something more. There was a sense that the script tried to do too much with too little (time) which left me feeling that most other romances in the script were very paper thin. ( )Scoring Background music: The scoring was good, which to me meant it served its purpose in conveying the characters' emotions, but not really something I would put in a playlist and listen to on a regular basis. Music was played at fitting and appropriate times with lyrics matching events happening. Fade outs of the music could have been timed with the start of a new scene to make it more appealing. ( )Lines and line delivery: Acting was great. However, actors seemed to be constrained by a weak script. A decent chunk of the script seemed to be information relay, which is not really needed and can take place off screen, giving more screen time to character development. Exposition could have been replaced with actual scenes non verbally providing information to the audience. Rather the script chooses to tell, not show.Another pet peeve I had with the script was the fact that the characters often stated the obvious, as if intentionally dumbing down the dialogue because the writer could not trust the audience enough to be a little more discrete. Also infuriating was the number of times a character asks Is that true? immediately after being told of a fact or right after a major revelation.A sort of meta reflective dialogue towards the last part of the show whereby Yang Sun uses the Night Scholar novels to refer to the show as a whole is refreshing. ( )Special effects and choreography: Fight choreography did not fall into the common one at a time pitfall which plague many good movies, whereby the hero or protagonist, badly outnumbered, is able to take on a group of enemies because they approach him one at a time. Special effects were modern and realistic, keeping the audience immersed in the fictional world.

In many ways, it reminds me of the TV shows Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, CSI as well as Hannibal!

I have no idea if lawyers actually investigate cases line Min in South Korea, but he certainly does. When he visits the crime scenes he's able to smell or taste the blood and see in his mind how the murders occurred\u2014a bit like how Will is able to channel the murders on Hannibal. In addition to him, the team is also made up of three others\u2014the detective Hwang Soon bum, rookie prosecutor Yoo Jung in and an intern, Choi Dong  man. These folks are a nice addition and the ensemble cast reminds me so much of the Law & Order franchise\u2014as does the way the cases are investigated and prosecuted. And, the heavy use of forensics in the show is like seeing an installment of CSI.Now you'd THINK that the show might be a bit like Twilight or Dracula but it's really like neither. This vampire does NOT sleep in coffins nor does he attack folks nor does he avoid the daylight like 'ol Drac but he also is NOT a sparkly, angst ridden guy \u00e0 la Twilight! He's unique and quite professional\u2014a lawyer through and through. Plus, now that I think about it, how different are vampires from lawyers anyways?

How young and fresh she is!In the beginning, young Jang (JOJ  for short) is a talented, ambitious, clever and cute girl, struggling for a decent life in clothes craft. But her fate is another. Number of turns of fate will make her the loved, the concubine,the Queen of Joseon Dinasty and finally the beloved sentenced to death by poisoning, by Lee Soon the King.From the first episodes we have immortal scenes: They (future King and Queen) as children, running through the snow, making promises under a huge, old tree surrounded by frozen roses (a wonderful picture!); The quarrel in the market between nobleman Min and the uncle of JOJ Jang Hyun, over social class and bribery (a great show); A few random and wonderful encounters between JOJ and Crown Prince, before to recognize their love; That amazing kiss throw by Lee Soon over the lovely Jang, in that water basin, in the rain, nearby only cherry in blossom, beautiful traditional painted roofs and a passing witness, Dongpyung; Cute and very funny tea scene, with the future queens (to much tea !); Crown Prince (actor Yoo Ah In) plays his role at perfection, love and wrath and policy.

It is primarily a mystery thriller with a touch of a fantasy element.SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: A seemingly perfect husband & wife's young child is kidnapped and eventually found dead. The mother is distraught and tries to drown herself, but she fails. When she awakens from her unsuccessful suicide attempt, she finds she has traveled back in time  days prior to her daughter's death. Events from the previous  weeks start repeating themselves, and she soon realizes she better figure out what's going on in order to prevent the future death of her daughter from happening again.The initial premise of the show is set up quite well. It's not clear why this woman was sent back in time or why she's the only one who's aware of the events to come. It is apparently due to God's gift, but this is never fully explained and there are very little religious overtones here. In fact, this time travel plot often gets lost in the scheme of things, except mostly at the beginning of the show, and at the very end; it does pop up occasionally, but this show spends a considerable amount of time focusing on its mystery and thriller elements instead. And surprisingly, there are very few romantic, comedic, or familiar melodramatic aspects to be found at all. It makes sense to not include these standard K drama motifs in a show like this though; after all, what couple really has time for romance and fun with their costars when their daughter is about to be murdered?While I appreciate the effort to avoid typical K drama themes for a change, the absence of these themes does create some problems when you have  hours to fill with nothing but one continuing mystery thriller plot line. As such, this story is often unnecessarily byzantine during its run time; once this show hits its stride, there's a bevy of characters introduced who may or may not be the eventual kidnapper killer, or who may be connected to the crime in some way. Each week it appears they might have finally caught the actual bad guy(s), only to find one more layer of the onion to peel back in next week's episode. The show is good at keeping you guessing who the culprit(s) is are, but this rinse and repeat approach to storytelling does becomes tedious when you have to keep it going for much longer than is really practical.Aside from a few missteps, production values are satisfactory for a K drama for the most part, though there are a few scenes (and one glaring one involving a car skidding out of control) where the editing and CGI departments didn't quite get the job done. There's only so much these departments can do on a TV show though that airs twice weekly.Writing is pretty solid, and the writers did pen an interesting & intricate story that they clearly worked very hard on. You'll have to pay attention in order to start connecting everything together down the stretch run, and this isn't always easy when you're a K drama binge watcher like I am (who also likes to have a few drinks along the way). The story is not really complicated, but I often prefer my K dramas to require as little attention as possible while viewing, and this is a show that really doesn't afford you that opportunity.Acting is mostly solid, but there are a few insufferably annoying characters on this show that will make you want to punch your TV. And as usual, you have to view everybody's performances here under the guise & understanding of how these K dramas roles are typically portrayed. Lee Bo young is fantastic throughout in the lead role of the desperate mom who'll do anything to save her daughter's life. Cho Seung woo is solid as the main costar portraying a washed up cop trying to help Bo young's character & her daughter while also trying to save his retarded brother on death row, heal past wounds, & reconnect with his family. There's various other important starring & or supporting characters that are too numerous to mention in great detail (i.e. Bo young's husband, the police squad leader, various potential bad guys, etc), but, I must give some credit to the   year old girl (Kim Yoo bin) who plays the young daughter; she's tasked with portraying a number of traits and emotions of a typical girl of that age, while acting opposite adults. Her character is also forever getting kidnapped, threatened, and put in harm's way by a host of menacing bad guys; this would seem a bit scary to me if I were a little girl, but Yoo bin just rolls with it all like a pro.And while there is no real humor to speak of, there is one thing (which recurs time and again) that I found particularly amusing; the husband and wife's baffling lapses in remembering that practically everyone in Korea is trying to kidnap & kill their little daughter. They both love and want to protect her, and often go to great lengths to save her, then they just let her wander off again, or leave her in the care of some incompetent weirdo or stranger or someone they know holds a grudge against them. I guess you need some means by which to keep the daughter in continual peril though.Summary: It's pretty good, but it has some faults and probably should've been pared down to the  episode range. I liked it overall, but I would have rated this at least a point lower than I did, if not for how it concluded. You'll have to sit & sift through A LOT in order to get the finish line, so the final payoff better be good when you eventually get there, and it is!Bottom Line: . to  out of  stars.

A new teacher arrives, and offers his students the chance to come see him in the counselling room. Once the students are there, they make a deal and sign a contract with him to get something they want, and it all starts to look up for them. However it goes downhill for each student pretty quickly and always ends badly, and afterwards nobody can remember the students who signed the contract. The first  episodes focus on five students, two episodes for each student, and the last two episodes focus more on solving what is going on.The two main characters, Ye Rim and Sang Woo were awesome. Intelligent, funny, and caring, what more could you want? Ye Rim is class president so takes it upon herself to be responsible and find out why people are disappearing and Sang Woo, who has a huge crush on her, helps. I was rooting for Sang Woo the whole time, he was definitely trying his hardest to impress Ye Rim! Their acting was good, as was most of the cast's actually.Most of my problems with this was the plot. Each of the students who signed a contract with the teacher had very fickle wishes: popularity, beauty, a boyfriend, etc. I guess they were trying to make it relatable for teenagers but frankly all the secondary characters were just stupid. Who signs a contract in blood? They clearly don't think things through! Also the plot was a bit inconsistent, especially in episode eight when the boy who signed the contract seemed to be recovering and being independent and then all of a sudden for no reason he deteriorated again into his former state. The thing that ruined this for me was the ending (major spoilers ahead). Ye Rim is in the dream world trying to figure out what is going on, and Mr. Han pretty much tells her how to escape, so obviously she does. When she wakes up he just decides 'Oh well lets just forget this whole thing ammiright' and just rewinds all the events. This made no sense to me. If the dream place was his 'heaven' as he called it, why did he just get rid of it? Because one girl escaped, because YOU TOLD HER HOW TO? As none of the students remember it they haven't learnt their lesson so they're basically all going to be the same terrible stupid people they were before. It just made no sense and seemed lazy and rushed. Also Ye Rim and Sang Woo had remarkable luck to get this far anyway, seeing as he obviously knew they were sneaking around his office and could easily have called them out in it. Did he want them to succeed? But how on earth would that benefit him when they are jeopardising his 'heaven'? Why would he give it up in the first place? So many questions!Because I'm nitpicking, the other thing that irritated me were the weird camera angles. There were some odd zoom ins of Mr Han that were really forced and just didn't fit in.In summary, if you've got a few hours to spare you might as well watch it, seeing as each episode is only between   minutes. It's fairly average but enjoyable enough for a quick binge on Netflix so worth giving it a shot.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Initially Nightmare Teacher (or Nightmare High) seems like your typical highschool drama but after the first episode it becomes clear that the story is far more deep and innovative. The plot focuses on personal desires of young people whether it may be popularity, appearance, intelligence etc and the consequences of not being content.Teachers are meant to lead us along the right path through learning, in some circumstances the only way for one to learn is through experience and consequence and Nightmare High explores this concept in a fantastic meaningful way.There is a light element of horror mixed in with some mystery. By the end of the series you are sure to have more questions instead of answers, particularly about the antihero. The ending of the series is left largely open to interpretation where the viewer will try to piece together everything and come up with their own unique conclusions. It also stuck with me for a few days!I thoroughly enjoyed Nightmare High and I hope a second season is being considered. Perhaps with a lot more focus on the mysterious antihero. On the side note, the soundtrack for this series is beautifully composed."}, "838": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "As of this review, I have seen  South Korean movies. This piece of garbage ranks safely among the bottom .A highschool guy changes his fashion sense and becomes more popular, but becomes a target by bullies. This movie feels like it was made for teenage girls who like to watch guys strut around, doing nothing interesting whatsoever. The humor is incompetent and the characters are wafer thin. The bully subplot is a dumb scriptwriting decision that clashes horribly with the rest of the movie; it feels like a desperate attempt to add fake depth. The fashion elements are embarrassing and not the least bit engaging. This is so devoid of content that it quickly becomes annoying, and it's frankly almost impossible to sit through.South Korea, along with Japan, has developed an outstanding pedigree for films concerning teenagers and or children. Just in the past handful of years they have delivered A Brand New Life (), Thread of Lies (), Bleak Night (), Han Gong ju (), Duresori: The Voice of East (), Silenced (), Pluto (), and Sunny () \u2013 just to name a few. They have also made some fairly recent teenage comedies that were really good. I have greatly enjoyed some of their more light hearted films.With that said, Fashion King () is a pile of elephant manure. There's zero charm, zero laughs, and the serious elements are offensively bad.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "I am posting a review for this film, both because it was a lot of fun to watch and because I don't think it deserves to be represented solely by a one star review. I, myself, have only seen around  Korean movies but could easily name  of them that are MUCH worse than this one. I am assuming that the previous reviewer was objecting more to the style and content of the movie rather than the quality. Why namedrop heavy critically acclaimed dramas in a review for a lighthearted teen comedy about high school fashion. Because that is what this movie is. And that is all it is trying to be. It's obviously not shooting for a Grand Bell.The movie follows sad sack nerd Woo Ki myung who is so badly bullied that his mother moves him to Seoul to get away from his daily torment. Entering a high school where fashion is highly important, Ki myung (with the help of an outrageous best friend and an underground fashion designer who is selling knock off brand names on the web) reinvents himself as one of the trendy kids and is successful enough to come under fire from the school's fashion king. Their conflict, while moving the story forward, is not the heart of the movie as this is really a film about what makes a person truly stand out from the crowd. Do the clothes make the man or the man make the clothes.This movie has some very familiar teen tropes  nerd becomes cool becomes nerd, ugly duckling smart girl becomes beautiful swan, etc. But this film presents them in a fun, kinetic and unique way so they don't seem tired or re tread. Won Joo is quite good as the tormented teen who still has a quiet self assurance about him, even as he is being humiliated. Seong oh Kim is fantastic as the hungry fashion designer turned mentor. I quite enjoyed this film and found it, not only funny, but charming. It doesn't take itself too seriously and is intentionally goofy at times but that only adds to the fun of it.

In Iris II, I don't know who is who after a single viewing, although the performers are quite capable of portraying a character, and delivering some great stunt fighting, also.From IRIS , I think the head of the North Korean Secret Service is the same guy (but we don't see him much), but the main holdover character is double agent, Park Cheol yeong, who is imprisoned now by the South Korean Secret Service (NSS), of which he was once a top boss. Anyway, IRIS wants him back, since he (alone) knows where some nuclear weapons are stashed. There are a few battle scenes and ambushes that involve IRIS bad guys attacking NSS units, nominally to get Park back. Park is having second thoughts about his nefarious connections, however. The rest you will have to figure out. Some characters seem to be playing on both sides, which will probably have you saying, 'Boy.. he sure looks like that other guy who plays for the bad guys..'. He (or she) may actually be doing that   I can't say for sure just yet.No word on our heroes from IRIS , which, after  episodes, was destined to have a happy ending and marriage for the two star crossed lovers & protagonists of the series, when, in the final frame, a sniper's bullet ended all that. Unlike an American Soap Opera, at least we didn't get both lovers surviving with temporary amnesia! Nonetheless, I was hoping for some wrap up or concluding info on that tragic event, but the Producers played hardball, and just carried on with a new potential crisis. O, well, woe is me.IRIS II is a good shoot em up entry, lacking the scope and intricate character development of the first series (this is only a  hour movie, after all). It might give you partial closure on IRIS , but, I think it's a bit muddled: looking at the photos on the DVD jacket, I couldn't tell you any of the character names, nor distinguish the bad guys from the good.

KTV love story melodrama.  episodes. Early Spring .SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: This is the  Korean movie 'Love Me Not' remade into a TV drama with a different cast, wherein a young heiress discovers that everyone around her is trying to take advantage of her newfound wealth. She's at a disadvantage in her fending for herself though, because she happens to be blind, suicidal, and has a brain tumor!. Yep!!! This would be a little hard to swallow if this weren't Korean melodrama, but it is, so you're just going to have to roll with it!A con man with low morals and gambling debts quickly shows up to scheme the blind woman out of her money; he was (SPOILERS) friends with her actual long lost brother (who's now dead), so he assumes her brother's identity and gets to work trying to steal a fortune. The con man soon finds his new found sister is somewhat of a kindred spirit though, and he begins to pity her and quickly regrets what he's doing. Slowly but surely, he begins to truly want to care for her as the oppa she's always been missing, and then ultimately, he starts to fall in love with her.If you've been around the block with these shows, you know where all this is headed; Can con man become a decent guy? Can blind woman find her reason to keep on living, if she doesn't die outright anyway? Can these two help each other heal over time, and perhaps eventually be together and find love and live happily ever after? Blah, blah, blah!This particular series is primarily a simple slow burn romantic tragic melodrama when you get down to it. I typically don't like these shows very much because they're usually relentlessly bleak and somber, and they're often quite boring to boot as a result. To be fair, I personally prefer romantic K dramas that are more lighthearted & fun, or completely outrageous. This show plays it straight with its story for the most part, and although it tries to avoid being too tedious, it can be VERY slow moving at times (especially down the stretch).The reasons for the two leads to fall in love are a bit sketchy, and, their love sometimes lead to being borderline creepy in an incestuous way. I've seen this semi incest theme in a number of K dramas over the years, and it never fails to rub me the wrong way. There's always some out excuse reason so that it's not actually incest, but it frequently comes across as just being plain icky!Jo In Sung plays the con man. He's got a nice charisma to him, and, he does pretty decent work here in the role he's given. Song Hye Kyo plays the female lead. She's solid too (as usual), and she gets bonus points for having to portray a blind woman week after week. There's nothing wrong with either of their performances, but it's hard to really like either of their characters in the long run because of the nature of this show and the characters themselves. There's a few other primary supporting roles, the most prominent being the blind woman's caretaker stepmother, and the mob henchman who the con man has to pay back. There's also your two secondary young pretty characters (played by Kim Bum & Eun ji from APink ) who aren't really all that essential to the main plot in the scheme of things; they get the job done well enough in their subordinate parts, and they're arguably more likable than anybody else in this show by default.There are some problems that hold this show back from being just better than average IMO. It has some really bad pacing issues as it progresses, and, several of the story lines & relationships don't really make a whole lot of sense as the plot unfolds, such as (SUPER SPOILERS): A) Evil stepmother actually truly loves blind girl and will be sad if she ever has to leave her? Wait! What?; B) Con man's gangster friend must kill con man if he doesn't pay off his debt by an exact date?...why?...his death would clearly benefit no one because you can't collect debts from a dead guy; the only reason this story angle exists is to serve as a contrivance for the con man to have a made up reason to face his own mortality (i.e. so he can supposedly better identify with the dying blind tumor girl he's in love with); C) Can you operate on the blind tumor girl or not?...make up your mind will you!; D) The con man's gangster friend also has stomach cancer and he's dying too, but he sort of wants to reconcile with the con man (or maybe kill him) over something that happened to a girl they both loved when they were younger?...why?...is any of this back story nonsense really necessary?; and on and on it goes.This show is not overly terrible, and there are several things to like throughout, but I can't really recommend it as being anything more than just barely OK. It screamed to be only   episodes long (even though I realize that is unrealistic in this genre), and, it just hammers you with so much nonstop agony & misery that the central love story ultimately gets lost along the way. This mix of love, life, and loss should never be as difficult or complex (and depressing) as these shows tend to try to make you believe it is, and, the more these shows try to convince you otherwise, the worse things will inevitably get. There's a fine line between an epic sad love story saga versus an unenjoyable & overwrought emotional tale that's not all that coherent or cohesive. This is a perfect example of a show that is equal parts both!Summary: Skip this show and watch the movie 'Love Me Not' instead; you won't miss anything and you'll save yourself  hours.Bottom Line:  out of  stars."}, "1346": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "30": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "This series like what wrong with secretary kim series but not at all.Very Romance and attractive to views.The actor and actress are also natural.I think this series may be popular like What Wrong With Secretary Kim.I admit when you watch this series you will so fun.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "This is the most enjoyable TV series I have seen in a while I am absolutely loving it would highly recommend hope it comes out top it certainly deserves too give it top marks love the story and the couple would score more if possible"}, "1053": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "458": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "803": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1455": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "I highly recommend this movie, acting , camera man did his homework, story is so meaningful, beautiful movie! also there is Chingoo  but it's better to leave em there.

In Korean culture, friendship between guys is a very strong relationship. Especially in the city in which the movie is set   Pusan   loyalty and sacrifice for friendship is seen as a very important part of honour.In this movie, friendship is tested to the limit from beginning to end, as the movie's two main leads (Yoo Oh Sung and Jang Dong Gun) grow from being teenage rebels to big time gangsters. The catch is, when they grow up, they become very different types of gangsters. One becomes a JOPOK   equivalent to the Korean Mafia, respected by the Korean people for sometimes punishing bad people. And the other becomes more of a thug gangster who kills and steals for fun.The direction is excellent, but the acting is the element which holds the film together as a whole.

And they are over the top good. If you haven't seen A Hard Day yet, stop right now and go watch it...see what I mean? Well, Seong Hun Kim, the director of that one, has a new one: The Tunnel. And it's over the top crazy. And over the top good.A car dealer, Jung so, just closed a deal for a fleet of cars and it's his daughter's birthday and he's driving home with her cake and happily enters Hado Tunnel Number One (which apparently runs for about  miles through the most untraveled stretch of highway on the Korean peninsula) when the tunnel collapses. Always something, isn't it? And not just collapse: a friggin' apocalyptic cave in of not only the tunnel but half the mountain, leaving only a few feet of the far exit still open. Jung so's Kia sedan withstands a pummeling of rock and earth that would have flattened an Abrams tank (good cars, them Kias), living him dirty, bruised, intact, and trapped.He whips out his cell phone, which doesn't explode, and calls the most incompetent  dispatcher in the Korean peninsula, triggering the most epically inept rescue operation in human history. Apparently, about the only things that work well in Korea are Kias and cell phone towers (and the battery in Jung so's phone, which lasts forever, and even his car battery which lasts even longer. Without exploding) because it turns out the tunnel was built by the most incompetent construction company in all of Asia, one that put in too few support rods and doesn't know how many fans it installed, nor where they installed them, and didn't bother to draw up the blue prints to any kind of scale or accuracy. And, which is in charge of building Hado Tunnel Number Two, a few feet away from where Jung so is trapped. After about an hour, said company starts lobbying to resume blasting on its new tunnel because, hey, Jung so is trapped in our first shoddily built tunnel so he's a goner so let's stop wasting time here and get on with it. All of which drives the rescue commander, Dae kyong (played by Dal su Oh of Oldboy fame)\u2015the only competent man in the entire Korean government\u2015nuts to the point he drinks a bottle of urine in solidarity with Jung so.No, seriously.All of which emphasizes the point that, if you're trapped in a tunnel in Korea (or a haunted island, or a sealed apartment) you'd best start thinking about getting yourself out of this pickle because the government honchos in this movie don't put a whole lot of value on your individual soul. I don't know if that's Seong hun Kim's particularly political viewpoint or the result of having a lot of crazy people to your north with nukes, but it doesn't take long before the ministries and bureaus and the population decide to write Jung so off and get on with it. Now why they would allow the obviously inept construction company to get on with it, I can't say, but it may be due to the particularly gruesome death of a rescue worker (apparently saw blades in Korea are made by Samsung) which is blamed on Jung so's wife, who apparently has the last say on whether Jung so should be rescued or not (someone should check to see if she recently upped his life insurance). Scratch of the ole noggin' here because rescue workers who die on duty in the US are considered heroes, not victims. 'Course, we don't have crazy people to our north with nukes.

We see his blight as he struggles to survive and how he comes to terms with the reality of what's happening. There's a superb balance between him and the outside world who is attempting to rescue him, witnessing empathy, sympathy and later tragedy but also the lack of, from the media and politicians causing conflict about what's the right thing to do. It's touching, when seeing the lengths people will go to in offering help in a time of crisis, like the radio station for example, playing him messages of support each day. This show of humanity reminded me of the epic TV movie of the late eighties, Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure and the more recent World Trade Centre, only fundamental difference, this not being a true story. Sometimes I felt like being a passerby, watching the train wreck happen right before you, seeing things going from bad to worse without being able to lift a finger to do anything. But on the flip side it's purposefully comical to display another side of what it is to be human. There's incredible performances for the three key characters, especially Cloud Atlas star Doona Bae who plays his grieving wife having to deal with the press whilst trying to do as much as she possibly can to aid the rescue. And Dal su Oh is superb as the chief, who's in charge of the operation who has this moral obligation to save him. The film is loaded with tough decisions and moral issues questioning you, what would you do if you were either of the three characters. It did drag, but only ever so slightly for the min running time. Has got an amazing score from Young Jin Mok and the set pieces are on point with some amazing camera work.

Now, concerning the storyline itself....I think there should be some clarification, especially for all those poor ppl who must have watched this in English (either subtitled or dubbed). Those who did the translations deserves to get hanged. and i mean it. i own the special edition  disc original Korean DVDs and have also watched both the subtitled and dubbed versions. It actually feels like i'm watching  completely different versions of the story! The original korean version has a much more interesting (not the greatest, but definitely superior and full of nuances)script and explains the story quite well, unlike the English versions that either skip entire parts of dialogues (which are essential to understand the movie *_*) or change their meanings into something totally different and just plain wrong! And someone mentioned that some characters' names weren't mentioned in the movie till the very end. Well, i can tell you that the names (except that evil adjudant(?)) are mentioned quite early in the beginnings, but mysteriously, NOT in the English versions O_o ! I'm on the verge of thinking that it must be some sort of conspiracy to ruin this otherwise great movie... I suggest you watch the korean version....or get a korean friend to actually translate you the real lines, instead of getting confused at the horrible English sub dub. anyway. oh, and i honestly don't understand all those who say that the story wasn't original,good enough,etc etc. i mean, it might not be the most mind boggling thing on earth, but the twists are original enough to set it wiiiide apart from your average anime movies where all you have is  minutes of explosions, punches, boobies, and some supposedly dramatic ending (that ppl apparently find original). For those of you who still think the story isn't well explained in the movie...well, there's always the novelized version that came out in Korea (no English versions, sorry) that gives all the background story between the characters and all. Like what really happened in Shua & co.'s childhood, the characters' motives, blah blah...Boy, is this review getting longer and longer....A final word... considering the depressing situation in Korea (let's just say that animation comics are ignored by most and the market terribly limited) the creators and all those who worked on this film did an unbelievable job.

From the look of the DVD cover I knew this was something I would not enjoy, the picture projected a film made of teen pop Hollywood garbage.I reluctantly agreed to watch it for a while but I became interested after about  minutes. The first half I thought was pretty good, until I realized there was still a second half to this. The second half seemed to drag on and I was praying for it to end. The overtime made me frustrated because I thought this was becoming less of a movie and more of a TV series (in terms of length). And than it was over and I realized what an amazing film this was.To keep this short I will tell you that I have directly forced about one hundred people to watch this film. The largest group I forced to watch My sassy girl occurred during two canceled lectures, students were sitting there bored so I popped this in. The class was made up of different social racial gender whatever cross sections. Everyone watched the first half and they showed up and stayed for the final half the following week, some people even came up to tell me how much they liked it. Only  people have given bad responses, one person because he did not finish watching it and the other because she doesn't like watching a film with subtitles.From the rating for this movie it is clear that there are people who hate this film, but if you belong to the other % of the population than you will love it.Why did I like this movie? It was a mystery movie with clues throughout. They made an entire movie with (basically) two characters. There was no pointless tacked on sex, not even a kiss.Watch the Directors Cut if you can. The movie was actually more enjoyable the second time around.  ", "Highest Sentiment Review": "*SPOILERS AHEAD*...taken from a reaction paper I wrote for Social Science Class..My Sassy Girl is a  film by Korean director Kwak Jae Yong, formerly known for the straight melodramas he directed. It was based on the novel with the same title, compiled from the journals posted on the Internet by Kim Ho Seok about his relationship with a girl. The film catapulted its lead actress Jeon Ji Hyun and its lead actor Cha Tae Hyun into superstardom. It spawned viewers' interest in romantic comedies, although it was never recognized in the west.My Sassy Girl starts out with Gyeon Woo, a na\u00efve but eccentric  year old college student who doesn't have a clear direction in life. He narrates how his parents raised him like a girl, and how his parents' constantly telling him he was smart caused him to become lazy. His life then becomes intertwined with that of a bizarre girl whom he meets at the subway. She was drunk and wasted when he first saw her, and before passing out at the subway she calls him 'honey'. He was then forced to take responsibility for her, and that night he carried the wasted girl on her back all the way to a nearby motel. Hilarity ensues in the following scenes, as Gyeon Woo and the girl share funny moments together, such as hitting each other on the subway, playing squash (the ball always hitting Gyeon Woo squarely in the face), dancing in the disco with their high school uniforms on, and exchanging shoes (the girl wears sneakers while Gyeon Woo wears heels).The early parts of the film showcase the girl's bizarre attitude. The girl can be seen arguing with strangers, writing synopses of action movies, passing out after drinking three glasses of beer, and hitting Gyeon Woo all the time, telling him 'wanna die?' and using him to get her way. Gyeon Woo, on the other hand, succumbs to all the girl's whims and does everything for her. The first half of the film is filled with pure physical comedy and witty, hilarious sequences.What sets this movie apart from others is how the second half of the film, which consists of pure melodrama, is connected to the first half. The second half explains the girl's bizarre attitude and unfolds all the drama behind the girl's comedic behavior in the first half. Gyeon Woo battles a conflict with himself and finds it hard to let the girl go after 'healing her sorrow'. The latter scenes in the film are so dramatic that it 'turns grown men into crybabies' (quoted from the International Movie Database). Jeon Ji Hyun's acting versatility added to the second half's strong impact on the viewers. A very ingeniously written script turns the laughing audience into a crying one in a short span of time.However sad the second half of the film may be, the 'overtime' part of the film wonderfully concludes all the comedy and drama that unfolded in the preceding two parts. Gyeon woo and the girl go along with the sad fate that befell them, continuing their own lives. The ending (which I will not reveal, for I recommend that people watch it) could be considered as one of the greatest ones in the history of film making. It left no questions unanswered, and it concluded all the subtle hints that the earlier parts gave. It left me, and other members of the audience, laughing in tears.The uncut version of the film lasts  minutes ( hours and  minutes), quite long for a romantic comedy. But it was so craftily and carefully written that one would not notice time ticking by. Every scene in the film gives the viewers something to laugh, cry, or think about. There was no dead air in the story. The cinematography of the film was excellent, for it captured every scene perfectly, also showcasing the beautiful environment of Korea along the way. The soundtrack very much added to the emotion of the film's most significant sequences. George Winston's rendition of 'Pachelbel's Canon in D' invokes a very romantic and joyous feeling that is indeed felt in the scene where Gyeon Woo gives the girl a rose during her class (at an all girls school) while she was playing the piano. Shin Seung Hoon's 'I Believe', the movie's main theme, served its function well as the tear inducer in the most dramatic parts of the film. After watching the movie, only hearing the song brings me to the edge of tears as I remember the saddest parts of the film.Jeon Ji Hyun's acting in the film was very superior. She does very well in portraying the unnamed girl (yes, the girl's name was never mentioned) in the movie. Her very strong charm and acting versatility (she laughs, threatens Gyeon Woo, and cries in one scene) makes the film very appealing, even to grown men who grew up watching action movies. Her performance in this film shoved her into the limelight and made girls want to be like her and made boys want to be with her.Cha Tae Hyun did justice to the role of Gyeon Woo. Just looking at him makes you laugh, and his being punched, slapped and manipulated by the girl is one of the big factors in the film's success as a comedy. His performance in the film made him one of Korea's 'most wanted dates', according to a survey on Korean girls.Some of the very notable characteristics that I found in the film were: .) It had no kissing scenes; .) The girl's name was never mentioned, although she played the biggest part in the film, and .) There were no 'I love you' lines in the entirety of the film.After watching the uncut version of the film, I saw tears in the eyes of most people in the audience. I could most probably say the movie has been successful in moving its viewers.Jeon Ji Hyun won the  Grand Bell Best Actress Award for her performance in this film. Cha Tae Hyun won Best New Actor at the  Korean Oscars for his performance in this film. My Sassy Girl was number one at the box office for six straight weeks in Korea and sold over , tickets per day in Hong Kong at the time of its release in . It was the second highest grosser of that year (accumulating more box office loot than SHREK, HARRY POTTER or LORD OF THE RINGS). It was the Best Asian Film at the nd Annual Hong Kong Film Awards. Just this year, Dreamworks (an American film company) has been planning for a Hollywood remake of this film. How great could this film get? My Sassy Girl is a film close to my heart. It is not only a lighthearted comedy that delves into the culture and behavior of Asian teenagers. This movie shows that there are so many different ways of expressing your love without saying 'I love you'. It is a movie that proves 'fate is building a bridge of chance for the one you love'."}, "745": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "867": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "History of the Salaryman (or Salaryman) is a KTV drama that aired in the early part of . The show revolves around the inner workings of pharmaceutical conglomerate and the people working within it.SPOILERS AHEAD!This show has all your usual story lines that come with these melodramas, but, it gets off to a bit of an unusually odd and lighthearted start. A good portion of the first half dozen episodes or so are handled with a good bit of comedic touch, sometimes hysterically so. It seems to almost border on being more of a parody at times, and I really was digging the fact this show was perfectly willing to not to take itself too seriously. From the off the wall show trailers & previews, to the theme music utilized, to the crazy homage's to other films & shows that seemingly come out of nowhere. It all makes for quite an amusing intro. Your basic story finds our young hero, played by Lee Boem Soo (Lifting King Kong, Over My Dead Body), doing whatever he needs to raise money to provide for his sickly mother. He plays the earnest everyman who volunteers to enter an anti aging clinical drug trial program as a test subject in order to earn some quick cash. He soon gets swept up in series of schemes presented to him that eventually leads to him work for the company that produces the drug he's the guinea pig for. While there, he meets the female lead; the outrageously obnoxious & bitchy granddaughter of the company president, played by Jung Ryeo Won (Castaway on the Moon). She's terrific as the entitled, high maintenance, heiress who curses like a drunken sailor and leaves a trail of chaos in her wake with anyone and anything she encounters.Our two main leads, who are polar opposites, get thrown together as a result of various circumstances. They bond, and she comes to have more respect & understanding for how things work in the real world.Your other two young leads are played by Hong Soo Hyun and Jung Gyu Woon. The former is the lead research scientist turned secretary for the company, and, she is your resident gorgeous babe on the show; if scientists actually looked like her in real life, I would have majored in the subject. The latter is your obligatory KTV hunk that plays the up and coming corporate ladder climber with a hidden agenda. Both of them do a nice job in their roles, and together, they provide for a good bit of the comedic undertone that runs throughout the show.These  young protagonists are brought together time and again under various personal and business relationships. From there, it's just a matter of time to see who will be with whom, what happens to the company, who's good and who's not, etc. In the meantime, the rest of the cast is busy plotting, undermining, and backstabbing each other via increasingly preposterous means.Everything is moving along swimmingly from the start, then, this show slowly & surely starts to move away from what made it pretty enjoyable to begin with. What started off as a unique and interesting balance between humor and drama, soon became nothing more than a standard heavy dose of KTV melodrama fare! Eventually, the melodramatic back & forth stories become more and more ludicrous as the series progresses until it all just about spins out of control. It's a shame really!This show is not awful, and there are several things to like here, but I can't help but think this was a wasted opportunity to be so much more than it was. I feel it would have been far better served if it stuck to its somewhat clever initial tone throughout the entire series. Bottom Line:  out of  stars! Not without merits, and I liked a bunch of its parts, but the sum of its parts is lacking overall IMO. Ultimately, it just falls in step with so many other familiar premises that I've seen over and over again in this genre, and, it doesn't do this all that well either. Also, the BIG FINALE was as an absurd and anti climatic an ending as I've ever seen.Watchable, but, feel free to skip it if you have other stuff to check out on the horizon that you feel is more promising."}, "1016": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "This had the markings of great Korean filmmaking.

I believed it was very good in the beginning.

Don't make THAT face. She literally made a face. I was disgusted and this is my first time noticing something like that. I've seen a lot of actresses be a bit stiff during kissing scenes but this was on another level. \nI really liked her in the beginning but toward the end she became annoying. I think that is more of the writers issue though since they're the ones creating her. However it wasn't as terrible as it sounds. I still like her as a character and have seen far worse characters in dramas. I had my issues with the second lead Seo Joo won (Lee Ki woo) was BORING AS HELL. I'm sorry but everything regarding him bored me to death. I started skipping some of his scenes but at some point I even stopped doing that. That's how much he bored me. I also didn't like him. He was unlikable from the very beginning. I'm probably the only one thinking that he was actually really selfish and a coward.Kang Ha na's character Jung Yoo jin was so dull and annoying. I really think I'm the only one that did not like those two characters. They both were so emotionless, boring characters, they deserve each other.I absolutely hated Gang doo's sister. Sooo unlikable. I hated Moon soo's mother and father. Both of them were horrible parents. I couldn't find anything in them that seemed like they were good people. I loved Ma ri (Yoon Se ah). Her character was very interesting. She pretended to be this strong woman whilst being very vulnerable and already broken.\nI liked the actress and loved the character.\nI LOVED SANG MAN. And I'm not saying this because he has a disability, no. He was really a great character. I really like the actor too. \nSame goes to the grandma and suprisingly I liked the director Jung Yoo taek (Tae In ho). He is actually a total a**hole but somehow I felt like he was just raised wrong and deep down he's actually a really interesting character. For some reason I never hated him. He did some ugly things but he still managed to be likable. Plus he was really funny.I actually loved the story. It was really realistic. I felt the pain and struggles of the characters but there were too many unnecessary flashbacks especially showing the same scenes over and over again. At some point it became really stressing though. I felt like we didn't get much romance. Rather, we had a lot of scenes boring people talking about boring constructions and boring contracts. I mean it started to get as if I was watching a documentary. I really hated the fact that the whole show was about that damn memorial and yet we didn't get to see any of it. Less construction site and S Mall crashing flashback scenes and I would be totally happy. But those got really annoying (seriously. were the writers architects???) Still the show managed to grab me, mostly because of Gang doo. His story and character just spoke out to me and I loved that we've seen more about his life than Moon soo's.Acting was generally very good, writing was pretty good, cinematography could have been better but was enough. Overall a must watch for someone who seeks out a good melodrama because this is IT. (I cried my eyes out)I'm removing one star for boring characters and their boring construction site talks. One more star for some lousy performances and unnecessary flashbacks.

The performances were good as well, and the chemistry between the two main ones really good, though the focus was more on the tragedy rather the romance for most of it. At some point, however, it did got a bit tiring, though it picked up quickly after, almost turning Uncontrolably fond on me."}, "633": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Bride of the Century aka Hundred Year Bride is a episode KTV drama from early . It was billed as a fantasy romance melodrama with a supposed horror element to it. It is not very good, mainly because it's too generic (despite its supernatural theme) and it's too hard to overlook its oft incoherent storytelling.SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: A generational curse haunts a family where the eldest son's first wife will be killed on their wedding night. This family is rich, and another family wants to marry their daughter into it to consolidate their power base, however they too know about the curse. The daughter to be married off doesn't want to die, so her mom and her concoct a plan to find an identical looking woman to pretend to be the first wife so she'll get killed instead, and thus the original daughter and mom can swoop in and marry into the money & power they seek.The girl they get to play the stand in to the bride to be looks exactly the same, but the  girls are total opposites in personality. Forget all the supernatural stuff; this show is the same story these K dramas tell all the time, i.e. poor girl meets rich guy, rich guy can't stand her at first, poor girl eventually wins everybody over with her kindness and spirit, rich guy falls for poor girl, they're in love but can't be together, rich guy sulks, poor girl cries, everything works out in the end because they were fated to be together. It's an endlessly rehashed tale that only works well if you put some actual thought into the story and writing, and this show does neither of those things very well.This story is also severely lacking in any creativity...Dual secondary love interests?: Check! A half dozen characters faint or have heart attacks at some point?: Check! Rich manipulative evil people?: Check! Everything is destiny?: Check! Everybody's family is endlessly intertwined with everybody else's?..Check! Check! Check! I've seen it all a hundred times before, and seen it done better many, many times. The supernatural aspect really adds nothing to this show of any benefit. In fact (SPOILERS), there is no family curse at all, but nobody knows this at first. There is a ghost though, who wants revenge or peace and or something depending on the daily script re writes. As for the overall storytelling and writing, it's hard to forgive the numerous instances of how nonsensical it is at times. I can accept many flaws in logic with fantasy themed K dramas, but I have to draw the line somewhere. Consider these simple questions that pretty much make the writers look like fools should anyone bother to ask them:) Why doesn't the one family just move out of the haunted house? ) Why doesn't the bride to be just simply not marry into the cursed family? ) How does the mom and daughter plan to pull this charade off when there will be an identical dead body leftover to deal with?...What about marriage license, ID's, fingerprints, the fact that they've committed conspiracy and fraud, etc? The show either tries to answer these questions (and others like them) with only basic curt explanations which make little to no sense, or it doesn't even bother trying to answer them at all. There are gaping plot holes everywhere, and none of the writers seem to even care. There is no effort spent in explaining why the poor girl would even fall for the rich guy; he's basically an ass towards her, then all of sudden she's in love with him so much that she's willing to die just to be with him for one night? Really? And, in the writers' haste to give everyone the growth and resolution treatment at the end of the show, they seem to have conveniently forgotten the fact that several of these characters were perfectly willing to kill our heroine on several occasions. What are they thinking trying to generate any pathos for these characters ? The writing and storytelling is so illogical that it's utterly laughable at times.Obviously, I don't have a whole lot of positive things to say about this show. I will however say that it's shot and produced well, and it smartly keeps to a minimum run time. I did mostly like the  leads as well:Lee Hong gi gets the role of chaebol heir bachelor. I liked him OK here, though he is given a typical part I can't stand on these shows, i.e. he goes from smug to angry to sad to in love, with little to no room in between. Star struck teenage girls might find these roles appealing, but they are extremely limited. Fortunately, Hong gi's character does get the opportunity to eventually show some more range, and he's not bad when given the chance.Yang Jin sung plays the female lead in a dual role as greedy construction company daughter and poor girl who plays her sacrificial double. Actually, she plays several other parts on this show as well in historical flashbacks. This is the first time I've seen her in a lead role, and I thought she performed rather well considering all the varying personalities she had to portray.Summary: I cannot recommend this show at all. The plot is as equally clich\u00e9d as it is absurd and the writers seem convinced it's a good idea to shoehorn every mood and genre theme into this show to cover as many bases as possible. Unfortunately, they are in no way creative or intelligent enough to pull this off successfully. If you're going to make a crazy murderous supernatural love story, then stick to your guns and go for it. Don't vacillate between that and a formulaic growth heal love story where even murderers deserve love in the end, because you'll just end up with slop like this show.

Although we don't know resurrected victims are real or not, the movie is highly enjoyable. It's based on the murder of a prosecutor's mother. As the film goes, they show how the murder happened. So, it gets interesting more and more.The plot is like wrapped in a mystery. It's a simple murder case, but it's kind of complex inside which gives you some excitements. It's one of those movies of simple plot but a great one. Everything is good, including the performances of actors and actresses, except that actress who played as prosecutor's sister. Her acting was like she was a crazy girl. In a scene where she was afraid, her acting didn't seem that she was afraid. More like she was crazed. So, her acting was very bad.All in all, it shows a mother's love, even the children don't care that much about their mother. Regardless of it's fiction or not, the movie is great and enjoyable.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "RV: Resurrected Victims is a supernatural South Korean drama and thriller. It convinces with a creative story line, sinister atmosphere and intriguing characters. The film however suffers from being too melodramatic and lacking realism.The movie tells the story of a young prosecutor whose mother was killed in an armed robbery seven years ago. The prosecutor has become a bitter man who often recommends the death penalty instead of believing in redemption. One day, his sister calls him to tell that their deceased mother has come back home. The prosecutor hurries home in disbelief and gets attacked by his own mother. He learns that she is a resurrected victim that wants to avenge her own death. The prosecutor fails to understand why his mother attacked him in the first place. He starts digging in his own past in order to clear his name and give his mother peace of mind.On the positive side, the unusual story line is filled with unpredictable twists and turns that keep the movie interesting from start to finish. The characters also have certain depth as we learn more about the prosecutor's past and the mother's motivations. The film has an eerie and uneasy atmosphere between the mystery and horror genres even though the movie remains a supernatural crime investigation at heart.However, the movie has a somewhat dull pace in the middle section. The opening sequence is memorable and the conclusion is very emotional but everything in between has considerable lengths. The movie is also highly emotional and at times quite melodramatic. It attempts to be a tearjerker but goes a little bit overboard at times which can actually be observed in many Korean movies. The fact that the movie tries to connect human emotions with supernatural spirits sometimes seems like a contradiction. It's an unusual approach which makes it difficult to find an emotional connection to the story, especially since the mother turns out being not the only resurrected victim in the story.If you like supernatural dramas with surprising stoy lines, you should certainly watch this movie. If you don't like emotional movies with philosphical depth, you might find that film annoying. RV: Resurrected Victims has a quite unique style but attempts to accomplish too many things at once in my opinion. It was entertaining to watch but hard to digest. I don't regret watching it at all but wouldn't watch it again."}, "1000": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "It was funny when the two main characters shared the same room with the girl dressed as a boy.

The storyline has the feel of an 'after school special' and stars young kids just getting in to Sungkyunkwan University to study to become government officials. Its full of student hazing, bullying, student and national politics all revolving around a small group of the students. Like Twelfth Night, this story involves a girl dressing as a guy and entering an all male environment (in this case a male only university). The protagonists are all extremely likable, and most of the antagonists actually grow on you as the story progresses. This is one of my top  favorite k drama TV series. The story is slightly PG  in my opinion in that it does have major characters from the local gisaeng house (female 'entertainers' of the period in potentially every sense of the word, rather like a geisha house). Also, for those that are particularly squeamish, our hero is distressed because he thinks he is falling in love with another guy (our heroine in her brother's clothes). All part of the comedy. The story is ridiculous because no one who looked at her would believe she was a guy for one moment, but just suspend your disbelieve and enjoy the stupidity and fun.

The ending was nice, realistic and acceptable.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Rooftop Prince is a Korean melodrama that aired earlier this year (). It's another fantasy time travel romantic drama that deals with reincarnation and circular themes that are common to many Asian productions.SPOILERS AHEAD!Your story begins with a prince in Joseon era (Korea; approximately  years or so ago) who dotes on his wife, but he also clearly has some interest in her sister. The sister was actually the one who was supposed to be the princess, but she got scarred in an accident before the engagement and was thus no longer deemed suitable to be the future queen. All is going along well enough, until the princess is found dead one night, drowned in a lake under suspicious circumstances. The prince sets off to investigate what happened and rounds up  people to help him (a legendary fighter, a brilliant scholar, and a cross dresser who hears all rumors and secrets in town). While investigating the mystery, the  of them are somehow transported to modern day Korea (via some magical once in a life time lunar eclipse or something).While this is happening, there's a nd story taking place in modern day Korea. Two stepsisters are brought together when a widowed divorced man & women meet. The older stepsister doesn't like this arrangement a whole lot, and she makes an impulsive decision to abandon her younger stepsister one day. The younger sister is orphaned then eventually adopted and relocated to America where she grows up not knowing remembering her parents or what happened to her. Once grown, the adopted sister sets off to find her real parents and learn more about her history. So, she travels back to Korea where she and her stepsister are reunited. Now, your gimmick here is that the  lead actresses play the roles of each sets of sisters in both the past and the present, and one of the sisters wronged the other during their youth in each time period. The prince from the past also plays another character who is the missing son of a wealthy family in the present; this makes for great karmic drama & intrigue that only adds to the overall entertainment value of this show. Korean melodramas have been pushing these dual role character timeline plots quite a bit lately, to a pretty fair degree of success, and it's easy to see why; this breaks up the status quo monotony, allows for actors to perform diversely, gives the writers and directors a chance to be creative, etc. I can easily foresee the day (probably very soon) when these productions will further expand upon this format by incorporating  roles stories at once.As the story unfolds, our  men from the past are transported to the roof top of the adopted sister's tiny apartment in modern day Korea. These men were the cream of the crop at their specific skill set in the past, but are totally incompetent when faced with modern day tasks; they can't even figure out how to feed themselves, much less understand how a toilet, elevator, TV, etc works. Our young heroine (the adopted sister) takes them in like a litter of lost puppies and puts them to work while she teaches them about the modern world they now inhabit. The prince is not used to living as a pauper though, or communicating with an independent woman in a modern society, so there's some friction between the two main characters to begin with. Soon enough though, the time travelers start to adapt to their new life, the prince becomes more involved with the  sisters in the present, and well, it doesn't take a genius to figure out where all this is headed. This show has what you're looking for if you're a fan of this genre, and, as a bonus, it's mostly accessible to those who aren't 'fans'. You've got your dual back & forth love stories between and among the  protagonists, your manipulative male and female antagonists, plenty of fist clinching hand wringing, family business power struggles, growth and eventual acceptance between family members, etc.The never ending Korean well, from which talented gorgeous women & hunky dudes seem to spring from, is still overflowing. The more put together or sexy characters are the meaner people, and the cuter ones are the nicer people, as usual. The main mean dude is ridiculously good looking, and, it's a shame the mean female lead didn't get to play the nice sister as her brilliant smile just lights up a room. It's almost impossible to not draw comparisons between this show and Queen In Hyun's Man; both shows aired very close in time to each other, and each feature noble men from Joseon era who travel forward in time to modern day Korea. Intrigue, hijinks, drama, & romance ensue; you know the deal by now if you've seen a few KTV melodramas. Rooftop has more of a typical K drama aesthetic to it in both production values and storytelling than does Queen, and it is by far the more soap opera ish of the two, whereas Queen takes a more stylized and slicker approach that's more similar to a well polished movie. Queen is also much better written than Rooftop IMO. That's no knock on Rooftop though, as this show is pretty entertaining. It is often sillier and more comedic in tone than Queen, and it almost runs off the rails a few times and does get a little too over the top and repetitive as it progresses, but that's the way it goes. Which one is better?...that probably depends on what you're looking for, or typically like. I personally prefer Queen, and I do feel it is by far the better of the two overall (for my tastes), but you likely can't go wrong with Rooftop either, and I liked it well enough.Final Score:  out of  stars.

This series is handled with a certain delicacy; a restraint that doesn't prevent or hold back, but depicts the tender beauty of two people in love. I submit that a viewer may find it very difficult to pass judgment, for how does one justify judging love? Can love be judged?To the naive viewer, Sunjae Lee is a young man, barely , who thinks and feels with his hormones. This is a gross misinterpretation and understanding of who he is. Sunjae Lee is a simple young man who knows how to do things in only one way: with love and passion. A gifted pianist, Sunjae is able to captivate his audiences, whether they be a concert hall or a few listeners, not with just the beauty of his play, but with the heart and passion he puts into it. Several viewers are so captivated by his play, that he moves them to tears. It is a bit ironic that a young man of  already knows the secret to love and living simply.Oh Hyewon is a middle aged woman, approximately twenty years older than Sunjae. A renowned pianist when she was Sunjae's age, she has now found herself pulled into the world of wealth and power. She works for a Seohan Art Institute as an executive accountant. She loves the life that her money buys for her, and she has long forgotten the passion and her own love for music. She is married to a university professor, who also works for the institute. They share a house and a life that is more like those of roommates than of spouses. There is little tenderness or warmth in their relationship or in their house, which looks like a cold bastille atop the street. It is somewhat ironic that the only room in the house that has any warmth at all, is the music room.Sunjae's talent is soon discovered, and he's asked to come over to the professor's house to play. Hyewon is asked to listen, given her musical background. Immediately, she is taken back to a time when she used to share the same love and passion for music that Sunjae has. Hyewon can't help but be enamored by the young man, unable to realize that she has already captivated him.There is a certain degree of irony in their relationship, in which Hyewon attempts to teach Sunjae about her world; the world of power and treachery. It is a world that is completely foreign to Sunjae, and he already realizes that he wants no part of it. He is not interested in money or acquiring things. And yet, it is his simple and complete way of loving, that makes him Hyewon's teacher in that regard. The acting performances are all first rate, especially those of Ah in Yoo (Sunjae) and Hui ai Kim (Hyewon). The relationship between these two characters is handled deftly, like a piano piece...full of love, beauty, and grace. Viewers may find themselves longing for their own Sunjae...someone who can love so unequivocally and unconditionally as Sunjae can. His love is all the more profound in the little things that he does to ensure her comfort. One cannot mention this series without the incredible musical performances. Nearly every episode has a piano piece that seems to perfectly coincide with the feelings of Sunjae and Hyewon.

The film has a lot of depth as it deals with the topics of friendship, life and trust in a gripping way. The two main characters are authentic, dynamic and sympathetic and most viewers will care about their fates until the very end. The camera work is accurate and slow, the light techniques add a lot of atmosphere, the Locations are mysterious and original, the soundtrack underlines the movie's atmospheric parts and even the special effects are gorgeous yet down to earth which is a perfect mixture most Asian fantasy movies fail to achieve.The story revolves around the friendship of two young outsiders that most viewers might identify with because they are both profound, sympathetic and resilient. Su rin is a teenage girl whose divorced mother died and who has moved to an island with her stepfather. She doesn't really get a long with her busy stepfather, fails to make new friends and is often seen as weird because of her interest in the occult. She's a creative, emotional and smart Girl who even develops a secret sign language. Sung min is a joyful, optimistic and quirky orphan boy who has a crush on the mysterious girl that is so different from all the others. He works very hard to get closer to her and gradually develops an intense friendship and even romantic relationship to the older Girl despite his friends' negative comments. One day, the young couple and two teenage friends discover a mysterious cave in a forest where they find a shining egg in a hidden lake. When Su rin returns to the cave to look for a lost hairpin, the three boys break the mysterious egg and provoke a supernatural event that will have immediate, short term and long term consequences for everyone involved as well as for their families and the island's small community. Telling you anything more would take away from the creative plot.While the event that kicks the story off is a supernatural one, the rest of the story is particularly realistic and has a strong emotional, philosophical and psychological touch. Heart breaking moments and thoughtful passages meet brief moments of hope and joy. The story remains interesting until the end that some might see as a happy and others as a sad ending which makes it even more interesting depending on your point of view.Vanishing Time: A Boy Who Returned is a particularly great movie for intellectual teenagers because of the two brilliant main characters but anyone who likes profound dramas or thoughtful fantasy movies should give this clever film a fair chance.

Melodramaticism is tempered nicely, with a tone that is very realistic and romantic.The previous IMDb reviewer complained that more ground was not covered by the film, but I felt that the script benefited from maintaining a focus on the relationship between the two main characters   and how the man's condition affects that relationship.

What fair Vampire Prosecutor from other vampire storyline is that it is Asian flavored.

In many ways, it reminds me of the TV shows Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, CSI as well as Hannibal! The show has an ensemble cast that investigate murders and it's led by Min Tae yeon\u2014a prosecutor AND vampire! I have no idea if lawyers actually investigate cases line Min in South Korea, but he certainly does. When he visits the crime scenes he's able to smell or taste the blood and see in his mind how the murders occurred\u2014a bit like how Will is able to channel the murders on Hannibal. In addition to him, the team is also made up of three others\u2014the detective Hwang Soon bum, rookie prosecutor Yoo Jung in and an intern, Choi Dong  man. These folks are a nice addition and the ensemble cast reminds me so much of the Law & Order franchise\u2014as does the way the cases are investigated and prosecuted. And, the heavy use of forensics in the show is like seeing an installment of CSI.Now you'd THINK that the show might be a bit like Twilight or Dracula but it's really like neither. This vampire does NOT sleep in coffins nor does he attack folks nor does he avoid the daylight like 'ol Drac but he also is NOT a sparkly, angst ridden guy \u00e0 la Twilight! He's unique and quite professional\u2014a lawyer through and through. Plus, now that I think about it, how different are vampires from lawyers anyways?

It actually started off pretty well   established the characters, the potential main conflict, romantic pairings   but then it became very draggy and slow as the first half of the series unfolded. I felt like nothing was truly happening, just back and forth running to the Vice President which in turn made the Top Team consistently volatile. I felt like the politics got a little too heavyhanded that it took away from any actual focus on the Top Team's functioning. I wanted to see more medical cases that involved the patients in the story without a myriad of extenuating complications brought about by the VP. I guess that was kind of the point, for the VP to keep pressuring the MTT, but it just got too tedious when every single episode that was the problem. The Top Team never even truly got running before it was immediately torn down, so in that regard I was disappointed.Large disappointments also arise with the plot (always meandering, never really focusing on and finishing each problem), but the character development was extra dismaying. We never got in depth backstories, no true insight to any of their intentions. No one really grew. The closest I'd say to have developed would be JJH's character Chief Han: we knew he has high ambitions primarily because he wants the approval of his father, we have the angst of his alcoholic single mother dying, we have him struggling with administration's expectations of him and his personal principles. KSW's character Park Tae Shin started off promising, but felt kind of forgotten in the second half of the series. Nothing really happened with his own mom angst, he was completely out of the MTT altogether so he mostly didn't fit in the main conflict anymore, which is quite confusing when he was billed to be the main lead? What I'm most mad about was JRW's character Seo Ju Young, though. Here was a potentially amazing female character: brilliant in her field, independent, ambitious, a prime example of a woman who's worked so hard to be strong so that she could excel even in a profession dominated by asshole men (mostly Chief Jang). I'm guessing they wanted her to kind of be like Cristina Yang from Grey's Anatomy in the way that she prioritizes her career and by doing so is seen as an emotionless robot. From her character introduction and initial episode appearances, they wanted her backstory to be something family related as well. What happened to that? Halfway through the series it was like she had no family at all. Nothing was really fueling her character by the end of the series. In the first half she at least had her ambition, but as the series closed her interest in keeping the Top Team running was entirely devoid of any reason. It was utterly disappointing to see considering she was my favorite character coming off the first few episodes. Romance wise, I was actually extremely pleased with how the lovelines turned out. I'm moreso saying this in terms of Chief Han and Seo Ju Young getting together as compared to Park Tae Shin and Choi Ah Jin (Oh Yeon Seo's character, who, as sad as I am to say it, was pretty much a useless character and only used as a prop. Like wth with that brain tumor nonsense at the end of the series? I will say they're cute, though, but thats mostly because Oh Yeon Seo is cute). In the beginning, I was seeing the connection between PTS and SJY   the cliche of upbeat man changes cold and standoffish girl   and was pretty okay with it. I didn't feel too invested, but I could see their potential. So I get it when people say that the turn of main lovelines from PTS SJY to Chief Han SJY was kind of confusing, because I also felt like midway through the series they just completely dropped developing the PTS SJY relationship   they barely interacted, and when they did it was just to discuss a case superficially. But I feel like HSJ SJY made the most sense to become the romantic endgame of the show   they have history, going all the way back to med school, that really propelled their relationship to me. Of course that shouldn't be the main criteria for a couple to end up together, but in terms of personality and work ethic, I think they were also perfectly matched. I see that people were saying that it didn't make sense because they always felt like SJY never showed any signs of reciprocating Chief Han's feelings, but in my opinion there were signs that she had a soft spot for him just as he had for her (his was just softer's, lol). You could see it when she smiled at seeing HSJ be happy about receiving praise from his father, which seems to imply that she knows how much he craves for that approval. She also seems to know the nature of his relationship with his mother (when she crashes their private dinner), and the issues he has with it, ergo asking him out to dinner to cheer him up. You could see how endeared she was to see him eat so sloppily too lol, as if it humanized him to her after so long of keeping up their professionalism. From my POV it wasn't that she lacked any feeling for him, it's just that she was always hesitant and, I feel, purposefully distant from him because she didn't want people to continue to think that the only reason for her success is because she's riding on his coattails and affections. That's one of the main conflicts with them so I think that's the reason for most of their emotional distance. I do like that she could be a pillar of strength for him by the end, especially with his mom dying, kind of turning the tables to the fact I've mentioned: it's not her that needs him, but the opposite. Chief Han's subtle proposal in the last episode was amazing, but mostly due to the fact thaf SJY was asleep while he was saying it haha! It was such a perfect way to close their story. As much as I liked their romance, I still came out of watching the series wishing that JJH and JRW would do another drama together with an actually good script, because they had great chemistry in MTT but was just failed by the writing.Overall, I'd say Medical Top Team was an okay watch. Not completely terrible, but definitely far from stellar.

It has the brain (legal battles) and the brawn (physical fights) element, which is a promising combination if you are into action dramas.

I was worried at first that this would ruin the cool prompt, but luckily, it doesn't, as it only serves as an additional sentimental watching experience. However, one thing does bother me: a clich\u00e9 couple conflict. The female lead character is at odd with the male lead, just because he keeps her in the dark for her own sake, while she instantly jumps into conclusion without considering other reasons behind his action. I'm sorry, but this is just too dumb for a so called lawyer, who is supposedly used to facts and logic. I also notice some details that don't add up, such as the female lead's inability to recognize her own mother when the mother is literally portrayed by the same actress with the only difference is the hair. Sure, the female lead was only a child when the mother left her, but there's a family picture in her father's photo studio, for God's sake! It's just too illogical, let alone since the female lead has always been longing for her mother, which normally would make her keep record of her mother's face. On top of the minor annoyance, the ending is not as epic as expected. It's all resolved just like that, making me question, That's it? Just like that?!\nThis drama is cool, honestly, but it doesn't last long, let alone until the very end. I think this could be mind blowing drama if the conflicts are prepared better.

The light comedic scenes also made the show very enjoyable to watch. A viewer would never become bored if other dramas of this genre added some light comedy as well.Great writing was also very much present in King's Daughter, Soo Baek Hyang. It used many literary foils effectively. It's quite obvious that kind hearted Seol Nan is the protagonist and her sister Seol Hee is the evil foil. As for the two princes who were switched, here is the other obvious literary foil. The upright yet dashing Prince Myung Nong's foil is Prince Jin Moo who is charming but devilish. Great chemistry between Seol Nan and Myung Nong was another bonus to this drama. They had one of the best romances in Korean dramas.

I wanted to get a hold on the storyline and a feel for the character before seeing this movie so i watched the drama. it was absolutely brilliant. the main girl in there, Ha Ji Won, was excellent, she had this proud ness about her that was either endearing or dis likable, but to me she was such a likable character,even if she wasn't lovable, and the dancing was so beautiful, especially the sword dance and the calling for justice dance she did to save her lover.with that feeling i went into the movie, i knew from the forgo that the movie would be different, would have different feel and the character would be different too. but i never expected to not like Hwang Jin Yi, or find her a bore.But i did, she was so utterly boring and the director tried way to hard for the viewers to feel sorry for Hwang's situation that it really ruined it for me. one of the reason the drama was so good was that Hwang in the drama was never portrayed to be a sympathetic character, the path she tread was the one she had chosen, she had no one to blame but herself, she never asked for our sympathy, and we don't feel the need to give it to her.the movie's Hwang was the total opposite, we see her as being forced into the situation, taking crap from people and being betrayed by her best friend then abandoned by him. all the makings for a sympathetic character, but although i did feel sorry for her as would anyone with a bit of compassion in them but felt like a cheap shot. and i was left feeling like I'm been forced into the feeling.what really did me in the most, was the fact that Hwang was suppose to be renowned for her beauty, intelligence and artistic nature in both drawing and dancing, the movie only portrayed her as a beauty with some brains, there was any particular scene that made us go 'wow she's so smart' and the most damming of them all, no dancing.the worst thing this movie did was being un memorable, it was such a shame, as i expected it to be much better.if anyone has the chance, skip this movie and watch the series, but if you want to watch both then watch the movie first, there is no way you can stand this movie if you've already seen the drama. one of the stupidest thing i did was go watch the drama first.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "I decided to watch this movie solely because Hwang Jin Yi was a famous person of my country's past.

Almost half of the movie involves senseless fighting and unpleasant sensuality, while trying to immerse viewers into the absent plot line.**TINY SPOILER** Clich\u00e9s are existent. It's the same old thing: Two young friends are tragically split up because of an overly dominating father, the girl goes through physical mental hardships (becoming a kisaeng) while the boy trains to fight enemies and ultimately to meet back with his childhood friend. **SPOILER END** The first parts of the movie pathetically try to involve viewers emotionally by using children to enhance our pity for their tragic separation, and grab the attentions of fight scene lovers by including a brutal battle scene. While these kept me interested in the short term, I can't say the same about the rest of the film.Some good points: What can I say about korean movie actors? Beautiful, accurate and gets to the point expressions. Although this film was Song Hae Gyo's first movie, she does an incredible job bringing up clear emotions according to the situation.The atmosphere was excellent almost throughout the whole film. Dark, brutal and tense lighting keeps audiences suspenseful and wondering what terrible event will happen next.

I was simply amazed and kept wanting to watch the next episode, no wonder they added a few episodes after they reached the initial announced number and of course I get now why the series received so many awards.Lee Jong Suk plays someone who has gained the ability to read minds, after he was involved in a car accident which killed his father when he was a child. The driver who hit the car, actually aimed at killing both father and child, however the main actress was present and even though she was intimidated into not going to court to testify whether the accident was no accident, she did go. The series starts basically from the point both main actors grew up. It is interesting how they meet, how they work together and how they protect one another.

I am so glad I got to enjoy it before it was taken off! You can still see it on the DramaFever website but it's not as much fun when watching on a computer instead of a  inch HDTV   plus unless you pay monthly on that site to take the ads off you are interrupted with them on DramaFever every ten minutes. Annoying!I particularly enjoyed the story of the fat girl who lost weight in order to be taken seriously by her peers. Her transformation was beautiful.The boy I liked the best ended up winning the girl in the end, but that was hard because the other boy was very nice too. I felt sorry for his character, he was obviously still in love with her.Apparently there is a Dream High  sequel but none of the same cast returned so I will not be bothering with that one. I am not sure why they bother doing that    bring back the same cast whom people felt close to the first time around.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Dream High is a  K Drama based around the lives of a group of students at a performing arts school. It's basically a musically themed melodrama about some young people.SPOILERS AHEAD!The story centers on the prestigious Kirin Arts Academy; a school devoted entirely to taking young talented performers and turning them into future star musicians, dancers, singers, etc. It's not easy getting into this school, but if you do, you'll be trained night and day to realize your potential.Enter our young aspiring artists. They come from differing backgrounds with varying experience and talents. They all try out to be accepted by the school; some make the cut and some don't for various reasons. One girl that fails to get accepted is given a chance to earn a special exception if she can bring in a couple of other students one of the teachers wants to train. Everybody soon converges together, and the story quickly focuses on the  young primary characters;  girls and  boys, some of which have made the cut, and some of which are trying to get in through the back door.The characters are forced to get to know each other, and have to work together to accomplish their goals (or work against each other as is sometimes the case). Some grow in life over time as individuals, others fall prey to the emotional pitfalls of success and failure. Along the way, some friendships are born and others are crushed, romantic interests are explored, and so forth. This is all very typical stuff for this type of genre, and, it's done competently enough to be a solid melodrama all on its own. All this is set against the backdrop of their individual talents & the arts school though, and, that is where the show really shines.Prior to watching this show, I already was aware that the  lead characters were actually fairly accomplished young musicians, dancers, and or singers, in real life. There's a number of musical set pieces and performances throughout the show, and the  leads had no problem delivering the goods in that aspect when called upon. Actually, I was much more concerned if these people could really act, than I was worried they'd be able to pull off the musical numbers. Amazingly, they're all more than acceptable actors and actresses in their specific roles, and some of them gave quite good performances in regards. Overall: Fantastic Job Everyone!I wouldn't actually classify this show as a musical; there are only but a few song & dance numbers (if that many) that spontaneously break out. Almost all of the musical performances are done within the context of story (i.e. during practice, stage events, try outs, scheduled performances, etc). There's also only a handful of instances of one of the cast members singing to another one, but that's about it. The way the musical performances are incorporated makes for real nice blend to the overall story. Neither part of these differing show aspects interferes with, or outweighs, the other; this is an important part in making this show work successfully as a whole, and, it was all handled with a good deal of aplomb throughout.There's a number of other secondary characters and story lines during this show's  episode run. Other artists come and go as guest stars, the school and teachers are focused on some, people's lives and families are looked at, etc. It's mostly all serviceably to effectively accomplished.What could be improved here?...not much (if anything). Asking to tone down the melodrama a bit is just not going to happen with these KTV shows, so deal with it. I suppose the production company could spring for some space heaters for everybody on the set of a winter time KTV show in order to keep their young stars from freezing to death.Bottom Line: This show is definitely geared towards a younger audience than I, but that didn't stop me from liking it anyway, and, I liked it a lot actually. It's enjoyable, and, it is quite good overall. The cast and crew of Dream High II has certainly got their work cut out for them if they want to be on par with this show. out of  stars!...Well Recommended!"}, "370": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "127": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "I've picked up this drama because I'm a huge Suho fan and I had to watch it.

But I did enjoyed some parts of this drama. Some scenes were cute and funny. But, I did not like the story line, as it was kind of messy. Aslo, the romance was weak. I mean, the lead had more kissing scenes with the second lead lady than with the leading lady. I guess, the drama focused more on the company, on the friendship, the past mystery, which wasn't that big, the development of the main character, and left everything else out until the very last episode. There were some sparks here and there, but the love story was very spread out. Aslo, I didn't like that sometimes the acting was a big too forced, like overacting.

It is a mix of history and fiction in telling the story of a South Korean spy agent who goes to North Korea under the guise of a businessman through China in order to infiltrate North Korea in search of information about the nuclear program.The movie's biggest strength is in the cinematography portraying the different locales of China, South Korea, and North Korea in its story telling and in the acting pulling in a cast of well established Korean actors. The camera work and soundtrack is also excellent which work together perfectly in creating high tension key points in the story and providing the movie with excellent pacing.The story is for the most part is more straight forward than what I expected from a spy thriller. It gets more political after the second half of the movie which is expected due to the nature of story between North and South Korea and it adds a level of complexity. What the movie doesn't do well is explain the motivation that drives the actions of supporting characters. The main character's actions were easy to understand but it was a little bit frustrating not understanding the driving cause of some of the other key characters.The movie ends with a clear message that will polarize viewers based on their political standing but it does so in an interesting way through the relationship between characters which does tie up the movie fairly well.

In life, I have had to say goodbye to many things  friends, family members, the Dippin' Dots stand I worked at as a teenager, and as I venture into my last year of my s, I say goodbye to my youth as well. Bidding farewell to Reply  continues this list, as I venture onward in dramaland and away from Ssammungdong. I say goodbye to that warm, neighborly feeling, that old nostalgia, that stirup pant wearing era, and to the best youth drama I have ever seen.Reply  outshines its predecessors. The story primarily takes place in a singular setting, and yet the narrative does not stagnate; it does not become boring or trite; it does not make you sleepy when watching daily interactions of the families. Instead, the story of R pushes at the heart and makes you yearn for friends who love each other this closely, for parents who love each other this much, for a life as simple and yet as hard as these characters' lives were. It takes you out of  and  and supplants you into  where you take that same journey with the characters. Perhaps the star of the narrative of R is its ability to exert both laughter and tears at the passing of a few minutes, yet it never feels stilted. It brings us richness and variety of character within just the five friends, let alone the parents and siblings surrounding them. With that, we see intricate details of each person's character  like Bora's unspoken love for her parents, or Dong Ryong's inner philosopher, or Jung Hwan's hidden sweetness, or Taek's competitive strength. There are so many elements of character that we see, often unspoken, rise to the surface with the passing of a quick moment or a prolonged incident.Not only did the narrative of R promote emotions from the viewer, it also brought the winds of unpredictability with it. The writers, in their infinite wisdom, flipped the switch and delivered a romance not built on the standard female lead being the only one in love for the majority of the series nor a male lead who said nothing but ended up the romantic star. It gave the person who stepped up and took a risk the chance to shine (and shine he did  delivering kisses to die for and a sweet chemistry with the lead that was noticeable from the get go). Furthermore, the show gave many couples a chance at love, both new and renewed, lost and found. It was never unrealistic or unfair to anyone in the cast (as some are quick to say); instead, it offered options and chose the best one. The laughter and tears that made me giggle until wheezing and leak all over my crooked glasses came from an illustrious cast. R's five friends gave their all to show us their characters' fears, tears, love, admiration, consternation, that random move in Baduk, and so much more. I have to hand it to Ryu Joon Yeol and Park Bo Gum; they made me root for both of them and create #TeamPolyamorous as a hashtag. Their performances were so spot on, and a new star was born. Go Kyung Pyo has always been a personal favorite, and as the sweet, slightly nerdy but quite handsome Sun Woo, he once again stole my heart  this time, though, not with laughter so much as with sweetness. Lee Dong Hwi as Dong Ryong was simply adorable; I would like to see more from him. Hyeri's Duk Seon, though the weakest of these performances, was true to Duk Seon's character  bubbly and outgoing, if not a little bit kooky. I could talk all day about the parents' roles as well. Ra Mi Ran, Kim Seon Young, and Lee Il Hwa trumped most drama mothers for being the most awesome trio of moms in a drama. They were not only funny, but they all showed signs of vulnerability and strength, and true to form, they were an unstoppable force on screen and in front of their husbands. Speaking of husbands dads, all the dads were awesome as well, but Kim Sung Kyun takes the cake. His President Kim routine will forever been ingrained in my memory, but also his relationship with Ra Mi Ran showed a great example of how love grows with age. The music of Reply  also played a special role, not only in the background OST, but in the characters' lives. From Duk Seon trying to win a Walkman to her waiting anxiously outside a concert venue, to Dong Ryong's cover of I Just Called to Say I Love You, to Ra Mi Ran's special dance, the power of music pervaded the narrative of Reply. It gave us warmth and it made us want to dance along. Even at : to  hours per episode, I'm going to watch this again. I enjoyed it too much and loved it even more. There was never a dull moment in this series, and I will treasure it for a lifetime. However, now it is time to move on  to leave the streets of Ssangmungdong  and flash forward to Dayton . I look at my neighborhood  siding coming off of roofs, puttering old cars emitting exhaust, the paint on the doors of my house chipping, and the possibility that after I leave in a year or so, it may be the last time I see my home of nearly  years. It may be the last time I get to say goodbye to my neighborhood, just as it is my time to say goodbye to my youth. For all things considered, the first  years have been a good run.

I'm sure I watched all of it (which I recall being somewhat of a masochistic endeavor), and this was only  years ago or so, but it obviously did not leave a very indelible impression on me for whatever reason. To be fair, I should probably watch it again before writing a review, but, there's just no way in hell I'm going to sit through  episodes again for something I've already seen that didn't stick with me the first time around. The main problem with this show should be obvious, i.e. it's just too freaking long. A fifty episode series is a bit cumbersome in this day and age of televised Korean melodramas. I don't have ADHD or anything, but this particular genre is just generally not suited to be stretched out for such a long period of time. I think the sweet spot for these K drama shows is in the   episode range (maybe a little more or less on occasion). Sometimes, lengthier shows can work well if done right, but they are much more the exception rather than the rule. As it stands,  episodes did not work very well at all here, and as such, this show is stuck in some kind of no man's land territory of being somewhat epic in length, but not epic enough in story to match its run time.Here's your basic story and outline of this show (which will perhaps be the worst and most lazily summary I've written on this site): Bae Doo na stars in the lead role as the soon to be named Gloria character. She's the poor girl working all kinds of odd jobs to help herself and her handicapped sister simply survive. Gloria eventually gets the chance to become a stage singer, but I can't quite remember how or why this exactly happens. She soon starts performing at a local club and also gets a contract job with some record label or something that's run by a rich handsome dude who takes a liking to her. Gloria and the young record company owner are the main leads, and I'm pretty sure they eventually fall in love, have their trials & tribulations along the way, then probably live happily ever. There are  other secondary leads as well: Gloria's poor childhood male friend, and some pretty rich girl who decides to slum it for whatever reason, and falls in love with the poor male friend. There are family problems & secrets, side characters with hidden agendas, some singing along the way, resolutions to various love angles, typical melodrama, etc. Eventually, the poor boy has to go on the run for some reason, and, somebody owns a chicken restaurant at some point that all the characters frequent, and, blah, blah, blah!This show is probably  to  times longer than it should be in order to be effective. As a result, it's often rather bland and moves along at a snail's pace. It's also chock full of stock story lines and stereotypical characters; I am sick and tired of these K drama shows rolling out the same  patriarchal characters over and over again (i.e. the poor worthless degenerate gambling scheming drunk vs. the rich entitled demanding snob who has to have things his way). If you based your real world view of Asian familial culture on the older male characters that frequently appear in these K dramas, you'd wonder why anyone in Asia would have any respect for their elders at all.I did not really hate this show. I'd say indifference, or ambivalence, is more of my overriding opinion of it. There are some bright spots here and there, and basic story would have been very workable in a shorter format. Acting is solid enough (aside from the annoying cookie cutter old dudes and the gangsters from central casting). All of the  young protagonists are mostly easy enough to root for, and everybody involved did what they were supposed to. The plot repeats itself endlessly though, and it all just ends up dragging on forever. There came a time that I just didn't couldn't care about this show anymore (somewhere about halfway through the show's run time). It eventually becomes more of a chore to keep following as it crawls along to completion, and, you'll almost certainly find yourself just going through the motions in order to finish watching it.I see this show is often summarized elsewhere using the buzz word intense (i.e. intense story, intense lives, etc). Frankly, that's laughable!...This series is no more intense, or set apart in any way, than any other standard K drama show from this era. Truthfully, it's all very status quo in nature, except that it's so long in run time that it ends up being little more than downright tedious & boring when all is said and done.Bottom Line: If you have a  some hour show with the terrific Bae Doona at your disposal, and nothing really ends up being memorable, then your show has some problems...namely, that its  some hours long!Unless you're a Doona filmography completest, don't bother watching this. Your time could be much better spent watching  other similar modern K drama shows which are much more economical, streamlined, and better, than this series is. out of  stars!P.S.

I am not a Korean nor do I know anything much about Korean history, but I could relate with the movie. The premise of the movie may seem a bit strange for modern viewers, but that was the sad truth: There were times in not so distant past when people were divided into strict social hierarchy; and it was a taboo to break those social norms. This movie is a simple triangular love story that forms between an aristocrat, his male servant, and an woman from aristocratic background that they both vie for. The cinematography is lush and full of colors, and the pacing of the film is slow without being boring. All three major actors played their part extremely well. Kim Ju Hyuk as the hapless servant caught between his love and his duty towards his master is subtle and subdued in his performance. He dominates all the scenes that he is in. Yeo Jeong Jo manages to expresses all the love, lust, and fierceness that a woman in her position can feel. And lastly Ryu Seung bum as the vain but effeminate lord manages to catch the psychology of the character so well that I couldn't help but sympathize with him.

It's partly the fault of the advertising campaign, which I understand emphasized Jo YeoJung's (as well as other actors') nude scenes    but I don't know how anyone can still retain the impression that this movie is an erotic bodice ripper after actually watching it. This is a dark, perilous journey through the obsessions and grudges of people who cannot stop running lest they fall behind, and the sweat is all of the cold kind.The said scenes involving nudity and sexuality are not in the least erotic, nor did I find Kim DongWook's reaction to the coitus by the book(literally) as the hapless young king at all comedic, intentionally or otherwise; rather he did a fine job of assaying a pathetic and desperate character trapped in an intolerable situation, and his mental near collapse was almost palpable. And the supporting characters' stories did not interfere with the unfolding of the main plot for me    they were not subplots so much as back stories for the characters' motivations, and served to flesh out, not complicate, the plot.Aside from the mostly fine direction and the acting    which latter ranged from decent (in a few cases) to very good (mostly)    for me the art direction and cinematography were particular standouts. While most historical epics tend to emphasize sumptuous costumes and the splendor of the architecture and ornamentation, this movie did the opposite; while it is visually rich in its own, gloom laden way, everything in it is in dark, muted colors as if it were dyed with tea, the ladies wear little jewelry and the sets are kept very lean, to sometimes very striking, almost expressionistic, effect, as when HwaYeon's maid is assigned new, better quarters of her own after catching the King's eye, but the room is entirely empty, and the woman is shown laughing in semi hysterical self congratulation on a tiny mat on an otherwise bare floor.There are many, many scenes shot at very close range, often lit by simulated candlelight at night, creating an overall claustrophobic feel that visually replicates the suffocating atmosphere of the intrigue riddled court these people endured. Fittingly, the scenes of violence are presented suddenly and starkly, with minimal cues in the soundtrack, which makes them all the more shocking yet realistic.While not exactly a masterpiece, this movie is a well thought out and well executed production, much superior to the kind of titillating fluff it is made out to be by some.

Byung Hee's best friend has a younger brother, Chul Su, who returns after a  year around the world trek. Byung Hee gets drunk one night and Chul Su is sent to bring her home safely.

Likable couple. The actor playing our male lead, Chul Su, was cute and appealing. The actress playing our female lead, Byung Hee, had good chemistry with the male lead and excelled portraying the character's struggle to take the risk to date a younger man. . Equally likable secondary couple. The younger sister had a interesting hate to love relationship with a much older man (she was  and he was ).

What I was less fond of: . Chul Su's sister was a bit over the top in her negative reaction to her brother and best friend finding love.

He saves Kim Taehee the princess in this drama from her medically induced coma. The villain is Jo Hyun Jae the evil greedy corporate brother and they are also in a medical setting with decent supporting cast. It's fast, fun and fearless. The only thing that bothered me was how the story starts to sink when the evil brother dies. The show should have ended with the death of the evil brother. Instead you get couple of episodes at the end which fills like a filler. Of course Joo Won has been in a medical drama before Good Doctor where he shone as the doctor with autism. He is brilliant here very brilliant, he is part doctor stuntman hustler and what not. Joo Won is very good here. Kim Taehee is competent in her role but not brilliant here. The only surprising thing about this show is the career turning move and the breakout performance of Jo Hyun Jae who plays the evil brother. This is really the first time he has played a villain of course he played a smirky sneaky adman in Ad Genius Lee Tae Baek, but this is a full on villain role. Jo Hyun Jae is that actor that has always played the sweet baby faced hero prince in countless Korean dramas. Here, he is menacing, intelligent, cold, heartless, articulate and passionate. Who knew he had that inside of him? The scene of the dinner party is a standout scene for Jo Hyun Jae. This is a revelation not to be taken lightly.

This drama is more focusing on Han Yoe Jin's survival with Yong pal Kim Tae Hyun's help throughout eps while the title yong pal means gang doctor doesn't really right for the whole story, also inserting their love story. I really enjoy this drama because of Kim Tae Hee's incredible acting. I'm not really a big fan of her, her dramas which I watched are stairway to heaven, love story in harvard, iris, jang OK jung not really appealing for me and her acting felt so so but in My princess and yong pal she really did a good job. Here she was acting great portraying a hurtful, loving, and cruel person at the same time and when she did cruel things instead of hating her I felt sympathy to her since we the audiences could understand her reasons and her pains for doing so. Not just a pretty face but this woman really can act. It's hard to gain audiences' sympathy nowadays since audiences' become smarter each time.However Joo Woon really disappointing while I was his fan at first but now I have to change that. Watching him first time since Baker king followed by Good doctor and Nodame cantabile (Korean version) feel that yong pal is his most degrading acting. He really didn't have many expressions either receiving bad and sad news, even felt disappointed he showed nothing very lack of affection towards his wive while he claimed he loves his wive so much nearing the end of the eps.This drama should have ended at  but the producer decided to extend it to  eps since they wanted the main couple to have a happy ending which I find unnecessarily. The story is perfect ending at  where Han yoe jin and kim tae hyun saying good bye to each other due to the difference thought of life, she is a leader of multi national companies in her hand lies thousands of people life depending on her good and cruel leadership while he is a naive doctor who is not thinking bright of humans' mind and rather stupid of business's world helping her evil brother just like betraying his own wive but he did not realize that. Both characters are too different to each other to live together unless she can let go of her company or he let go of his naive thoughts and what he called a kindness if not he'll be continued being used as a tool to hurt her. The writer of this drama at first making yong pal's character really good and bright he understood how the society works but nearing the end the writer wanted to make a conflict between a lover hence creating the naivety of yong pal who was being raised as a poor child and had already felt the cool and the cruel reality of the world which rather not make sense, I blame the writer and the producer who was trying to change the original concept of this drama to their own mellow dramatized version.Yes it's a happy and short ending."}, "1106": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "218": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Although this drama has only two episodes, it manages to present the story beautifully.

I was touched by some of the subject matters and found them to be really modern and surprising compared to the more fairytale esque worlds of other dramas.

Uncontrollably Fond certainly does not revolutionise the art in this respect, however this most certainly shouldn't discourage you, as what it does do is deliver an incredibly polished representation of the genre, from start to finish.From the beginning the stereotypical dynamics appear to immediately emerge. Bae Suzy is the classic underdog female lead, whose father is run over by the opposing female main, and lives with the weight of injustice at the hands of a corrupt social divide. Kim Woo Bin plays the handsome, rich and cocky star who has had lingering, yet vague, feelings for our beleaguered heroine since their high school days. There is also the obligatory love rival, while the aforementioned opposing female main completes the love rectangle. However, while these formulas are all too familiar, there are just enough atypical elements and twists introduced to keep the storyline fresh and engaging.. As soon as the story begins, Woo Bin's character is diagnosed with terminal cancer, and this represents the main driving force of the narrative, and the execution of this plot line throughout covers over other rehashed elements, almost seeming as if you are watching something entirely fresh and new.Of course, you are not  and there are some typical criticisms. Viewers will have to suspend their disbelief somewhat in the female lead's underdog status, given she is one of the most beautiful women in Korea, however since she naturally possesses a girl next door vibe, and they manage to compensate by downplaying her wardrobe considerably compared to the typical k drama lead  it's no big obstacle.. In fact this arguably plays into favour  her wardrobe is more realistic to the character, and adds to the down to earth effect that you really can believe would make her a unique person to the hearts of the male leads, not to mention male audience members watching. There are also some bridges to be made in certain character motivations at some points, as is again typical, but viewers willing to accept a certain degree of this is inevitable will be rewarded.The pacing of the story from the start is near perfect, and the story seamlessly transitions from phase to phase at most of the correct timings. Personally, I had a huge gripe with the pacing elements in Kim Woo Bin's previous drama hit The Heirs, as I felt the push pull love triangle phase of that story was dragged out far too long, and to the point where it grew stale and repetitive  Uncontrollably Fond has no such issues, and makes significant advances in plot, if not in every episode then certainly within  . The acting is similarly fantastic in my book  Bae Suzy was previously criticised by many for her lack of range in Architecture , yet shows off the complete spectrum here with talented subtlety. Kim Woo Bin too produces the performance of someone who has mastered their craft, especially with certain story elements that would have been difficult to execute technically as you will see.In fact, that encapsulates this production and why I was willing to give it a . We may not be breaking any ground here, but most elements ring of having been produced by people using the weight of accumulated experience to produce a well rounded and complete article. This drama knows what it is doing  Uncontrollably Fond will toy with your emotions, pulling them this way and that  having you crying one minute and grinning like an idiot the next before the tears can even dry. As the subject matter suggests, it is primarily a melodrama, and a very successful one at that. By the end you can expect to feel hollow and empty inside, with a bittersweet nostalgia to the lives of these fictional characters, as the hallmark of a k drama's job well done.So don't forget the tissues ready."}, "90": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "Watched the show because it got high tv rating. turned out, it just because of the cast casts.the Prince was so spoiled, unnecessarily cruel, no character development whatsoever until the end of the show. the plot got really boring in the middle, then only picking up in  episodes only, and then fall down again during the last episode, after the villain got defeated (tbh the whole episode  can be scraped. the happily ever after can be put into episode ). dont forget those unrealistic, cringy, unnecessary scenes that didnt make any sense, only there to make fangirls blushthe lead actor lacking a lot, maybe because of the lack of experience in staring a  episode drama as a lead character. didnt get me to cry in the supposedly saddest scene in the drama (because lbr kdramas ARE created to make people cry)", "Highest Sentiment Review": " Days My Prince is a drama with grace and eloquence, much attributed to the flawless script.

The female teacher is unbalanced and crippled with her soleness over the age while the student suffers from the alienation from the local community. Their common resolution is their own one sided affection toward a young and handsome bachelor teacher.

I'm no expert, that's for sure, but you can tell that they really put a LOT of effort into creating an excellent, involving story. The acting, alone, is WAY above the average American film (and I happen to have been raised by and live near San Diego :)This primarily is a Police Procedural about a father looking for his kidnapped child, but it has some nice, low key, Science Fiction touches that are integral to the story. You can likely guess what some of these are by the title of the film. But, what I was most impressed by was just how well done the movie was. It honestly kept me in suspense and did an excellent job in maintaining that tension throughout the entire film.I read one external review where they dismissed this movie as a poor copy of another really well known (and quite excellent) film. I won't mention the title of it because I don't want to give too much away. But, I very much disagree with that reviewer because as masterful and stunning as the other film is that he was referring too, I truly feel that a movie should be judged on it's own as to how well it is put together and based upon the quality of it's story, direction, acting, etc. And, this one I felt was actually quite good. It's not a Sci Fi Blockbuster by any means, so please don't expect 'TRANSFORMERS' like effects and such. No, this is mainly a powerful Police Drama along with an excellent Mystery as to what has happened to the child. Add in the nice Sci Fi elements that propel the story and I feel that you have a very entertaining movie that does an excellent job in involving the audience in not only the search for the man's son, but also the intriguing twists and turns that reveal themselves as time goes on.If you like a good Police Drama   Thriller and also enjoy some light Sci Fi elements woven into the story, I think that there is a good chance that you might enjoy this film."}, "1088": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1005": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "250": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "88": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "525": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "841": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "699": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1115": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1062": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "883": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1190": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "660": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1432": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "908": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "142": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1220": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "478": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "My Beautiful Bride is an action thriller drama about a man who would do anything to find his missing fianc\u00e9e, even if he has to get his hands dirty in the process.

With minimal resources and no clue what they're doing, they have little chance to succeed, but with a lot of fighting spirit and some good fortune, perhaps they can pull it off (and thus, pay off their debts, save the company, realize their dreams, etc).Full disclosure: I wasn't really planning on watching this show. But, as I often do, I'll give just about any KTV show I can a quick courtesy test look by checking out an episode or two. If it appears to be any good or something I might like, I'll either keep viewing until it stinks or until I've seen too many episodes to not go ahead and finish it out. This particular show did appeal to me fairly quickly, so I stuck with it to the end.Before going any further, let's get one thing out of the way right off the bat: If you're looking for a K drama for no other reason than its jammed packed full of pretty young Korean girls, than this is the show for you! One would figure there would have to be at least a few cuties on hand since it's a story about winning a beauty pageant, but, there's probably a good  of 'em or so available at any given moment (and they are frequently put to use). This doesn't get racy or overly exhibitionist per se; the story takes place in  Korea (so, it's fairly tame by today's standards), however, there is a clear and consistent effort to get these girls on screen whenever possible.Looking past all the hotties running around in bathing suits and the like, there's a decent underdog drama story to be had here. The primary players are all down on their luck and they need to figure out how to simply survive while trying to maintain their dignity as best as possible. They have a lot of individual differences and personal agendas, but they eventually start bonding little by little. Standing in the way of them is a host of slime ball investor boss politician types, some gangsters, and a bevy of backstabbing bitches.The titular Miss Korea is played by Lee Yeon hee; I've seen her in several previous projects, and while certainly attractive, she's yet to impress me with her acting ability. She really deserves some credit for her performance here though. Whether this is just the result that comes from her own experiences & maturity, a perfectly suitable role, the light switch finally going on, hard work, or whatever, she's quite effective and impressive throughout this show.There's a bit of late ''s nostalgia involved with this show (some occasional big hair, gigantic computer monitors, songs from that era, etc...), but it could otherwise easily be mistaken for a drama that takes place in the present day. I'd even argue that this show's theme is just as relevant now as it was back in '; there's a significant focus on just trying to make a living during a crappy global economy, along with the enormous amount of pressure & sacrifices relating to succeeding within any form of the Korean entertainment industry. There's also the semi historical rehash of IMF support for that era, along with the introduction of the legendary BB cream, etc. This all serves to benefit & augment the primary story fairly well.One of the better aspects of this show is its eclectic group of supporting characters and how they're dealt with; these characters are focused on as needed and many of them shine when called upon. The elevator girl's uncle, father, and extended family have their infrequent moments, and, the actress who portrays the Godmother of the Miss Korea pageant gives a mesmerizing performance in an important side role. The budding relationship between the aging gangster and cosmetic scientist really takes the cake though; it's such an oddly awkward romance that is really hard not to like in the long run.If this show has one fatal flaw, it's this: Where is the eye candy for the female viewers?...A typical K drama will usually have a fairly equal mix of attractive male & female cast members (i.e. for every super sexy Woman, there is usually a smoking hot Man, and for every cute young Girl, there is usually a pretty flower Boy, and so on). Not here though; this is the most disproportionate Korean show I've ever seen in regards to the F M attractiveness ratio. Lee Sun kyun is your male lead and he's good looking, but his role calls for him to primarily portray a desperate guy with a consistently pained & nervous demeanor (thus reducing his attractiveness ratio). There's a tall investor type dude who also likes elevator girl, but he's not utilized much and is more of a side character than a romantic interest. Maybe one of nerdy scientists can be considered cute I guess, but that's about it. So, Sorry ladies! If you're looking for stoic silent leading men, random shower scene material, and young K pop hunks, you'll need to look elsewhere.Summary: For a K drama, I really liked this show for the most part. It's far from perfect, but I found its somewhat offbeat approach and underdog theme to be more than entertaining enough, and it still retains the typical melodrama and themes one would expect from this genre.Bottom Line: .  out of  stars."}, "297": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "I loved it was a great romantic comedy!!!"}, "704": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "325": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "955": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "454": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1299": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "461": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1056": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "592": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "totally i didn't even knew what this thing was a TV show or a film i was just given a disc by the store worker and this was the worst experience i ever had.this nonsense was release in year  i saw this today and skipped the rest as bad acting,awful sex scenes and stupid story made me angry the plot just goes nowhere its the same old usual theme where someone gets murdered and the police officer falls in love with the witness not knowing the real killer could be in fact the witness itself.this is a south Korean film or rated r show its got a NC  rating but forget it there is hardly any good sex and violence in it near  minutes is just boring dialog.this is divided in either  or  parts with each different story and characters this one is called temptation of eve:angle,this is hard to search online thanks to the opening credits and IMDb that listed the company OCN name here the logo of OCN is in the beginning when film starts no wonder no one would buy this mess the company never made a single project that's worth watchable.this is a insult to any genre out there if someone is expected action scenes get ready to be disappointed hard as this is some awful crap not worth discussing all the actors got wasted here.i like Chinese,Korean & Japanese films & shows but this was ridiculous pure waste of both time & money its year  and i am the only guy in the world who saw this when great films are releasing i ruined my morning so i have to warn others beware of this please.Overall Temptation Of Eve:Angel  should be avoided at all costs my rating is   Skipp it.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "None"}, "1297": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "39": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "282": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "Not typical romance kdrama.. but it's the reality behind business, justice, and so on.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "I literally loved this drama.

My other favourite part of the drama was Moon Chae Won as Lee Se Ryung confrontation with Kim Young Chul as her father Prince Suyang (later King Sejo) This was me was surprising to see in a korean drama.

I also liked the fact that Kim Roe Ha as Jo Suk Joo was a better fighter than the hero. I found the performance of the two leads ie the aforementioned Moon Chae Won, and Park Shi Hoo as Kim Seung Yoo to be fine. She was probably better than him. But I would say that Song Jong Ho as Shin Myun was better than Park Shi Hoo The ending. At first I had the wrong idea. So the king and his wife are going somewhere. The king spots somebody who looks like supposedly our hero Kim Seung Yoo. So seeing as the king looks so old, I thought the guy he spotted was Kim Seung Yoo's son.

For me it certainly wasn't a predictable ending, but for that ending the villain had his character completely changed. So the ending is good, in basically letting the villain get away with what he did. But bad in that it conveniently forgets what kind of character he was.

Wow i have to say...this show beat all expectations. matter of fact its so good..i have rated this as one of the best TV (mini)series ever. A must see.The story seems pretty straightforward and quite easy to get into. A cross between Cinderella and she's the man. The synopsis tells the story.But this is not a Hollywood made show.It goes much deeper than that. Where this show truly excels is portraying the relationships of the different characters in the show. Maybe its my Asian background. But the way they portray it and decisions made comes so close to my own experiences that its downright scary and also very touching.I guess it explains the huge success of the show...who ever watched this. They will see a parallel to their own situation. From a difficult relationship between a father and a son, to a mother trying to balance her need to find a new partner and her duty towards her daughters.To me it was the start of the boyfriend girlfriend relationship between EunChan and KanKyul. It mirrors my own experience so closely. The calling game, the little games you play with each other that could lead to misunderstandings and fights. And all this because you are afraid of the strong feelings you have for another person. Not knowing how to express it or how the other person feels about you. The beautiful thing is...they take there time to portray this and it works real well.Where Hollywood stops with just the love story, this shows continues exploring and portraying the relationship behind the lovestory.I can't recommend this how highly enough.

All that said, the highlight of this movie is the relationship between Wan Deuki and his teacher. This is the source of a great deal of humor and warmth throughout the movie, and will make you laugh out loud more than other Korean movie I can think of.

This movie has got a decent storyline, but there are just too many plot holes in this movie that made this movie bad. The movie starts of very well, with an extremely frightening scene that kept me glued to the screen. A student wanted to take revenge because a teacher did something to her. The way this Mrs Park got hanged was frightening. After the first twenty minutes the movie just got really bad. There were just really very long boring conversations between the two girls. They just seem to keep on talking forever. Then there was one silly part where another girl in the art room pretends to say maybe I am the ghost and smokes to act cool. Then another long boring conversation was carried out between the two girls again. This show was not scary at all. It didn't even build enough tension and fear to the climax. The violent acts of the teachers were the scary ones. A really big plot hole for this movie is who locked Jin Ju in the art room. This was not explained at all. I am still confused what ,,, is all about. And why this pattern? The girls rang and rang and rang the bells so many times and is just so repetitive. At least there was one scary scene showing Jin Ju attacking Mad Dog. This movie really shows the school system in Korea very well. The last few scenes of this film were unsatisfying. I could not figure out many stuff that were happening. Why did Jin Ju turned her head back at the end? Why was the classroom empty? Why was blood being all over the classroom? Lots of questions just come to my mind. The acting towards the end of the film was not good, it was not convincing. When Jin Ju was about to kill the teacher in the end why did the teacher frown? Was she frustrated? Sad? happy? I cannot understand her weird expression. This teacher also acted in Bunshinsaba and her acting did really improve a lot in that film. I could not understand anything towards the end of the movie. However some of the good merits to this movie includes, cultural interest, mystery and so on..... I have so far only watched wishing stairs and this movie and wishing stairs is by far a much better film than this. If you are interested in the whispering corridors series, watch wishing stairs. My rating for this movie:. ", "Highest Sentiment Review": "'Whispering Corridors' is set in a South Korean all girls high school, focusing on a senior class and four of its students. Although it's a horror film, Whispering Corridors seems to be a drama at heart. The school building is very atmospheric and eerie, and there's some spooky shots of long corridors and deserted classrooms. Along with that, we also explore the extremely competitive and harsh South Korean education system, identity and reputation, and the relationships between the four students and one teacher.After the suicide of Mrs Park (or 'Old Fox' as she's known amongst the pupils), rumours begin circulating around the school about what caused her death. Girls fall out, and come together; there's a ghost who apparently haunts the old, disused art room, and people aren't who they first appear to be...A thinking man's film indeed, this will have you scratching your head in some parts. Not a lot of blood, but some tense scenes of violence. A chilling atmosphere and setting endures throughout, the director certainly knows how to set a scene. He also gets the best of the cast, who are all exceptional. Mr Oh; aka Mad Dog, is a particular stand out as a vile, abusive teacher. Altogether a very character and theme driven story, with interesting social commentary. If you like slow burn, atmospheric, subtle horror, you'll like this. P.S. There's an intriguing quote towards the end, where a character says It didn't matter who I chose as long as I filled the seats. A comment on the emphasis upon status and reputation in the classroom, and thus, lack of identity? Or a jab at the thought that Asians look really similar? (At least to those from outside Asia.)

Then you will be rewarded with feisty girls, pretty boy actors (flower boys), excellent cinematography, catchy music scores and sweeping stories like Moon Lovers.The plot: During a total eclipse of the sun, a  year old st century woman, Go Ha jin (Lee Ji Eun), is transported back in time to Goryeo Dynasty. She wakes up in the year , in the body of  year old Hae Soo and there, she encounters the many royal princes of the ruling family. She initially falls in love with the gentle and warm th Prince Wang Wook (Kang Ha Neul), and later with Wang So (Lee Joon Gi), the mutilated th Prince who hides his scarred face behind a mask. He's surnamed wolf dog, because he had to fight wolves when he was still young and was treated badly as a hostage. Now he likes to foster his image as a fearsome beast. There's a fight for the throne going on. Hae Soo finds herself caught between it all. Thanks to her history lessons at school she comes to realize Wang So will win this battle finally. He'll become the future king of Goryeo, and a bloody tyrant at that. Soo loves So, but she also fears him. Can she change her lover into a better ruler in time? The Good: The first meeting of the 'Moon Lovers', Hae Soo and Wang So, sets the tone for the whole series: old fashioned romance but a love that hurts. There's the black Wolf Prince riding his war horse, first endangering Hae Soo but saving her as well by lifting her in the saddle in front of him. Then there's the extended closeup of their faces, sitting opposite each other, bouncing up and down, having their eyes on each other while the music plays their love theme. The next scene he seems afraid of his own feelings and So drops Soo to the ground. Their love is painful, literally.Leading man Lee Joon Gi is simply the best actor available for that kind of TV making. The minute he appears on the screen I am glued to his face and facial expressions despite his mask, that renders all kinds of emotions like joy, pain, embarrassment, hate. Notwithstanding his well performed fighting scenes, he's in danger of becoming a modern Rudolph Valentino, with female fans only. I hope he'll get the chance to proof himself in less romantic roles playing more tormented characters like the lead in Man on High Heels ()for example.The Bad: Moon Lovers is a remake of the Chinese series 'Scarlet Heart' with  episodes. The original version could handle all the princes and their love interests. The Korean production however should have cut some story lines to flesh out the characters of Soo and So, who are the protagonists, giving them more time to develop their romance. Now we were misled thinking Wang Wook was Soo's Prince Charming. Kang Ha Neul gives a stunning performance, so it was no punishment to watch him stealing screen time from Lee Joon Gi. But the story lines became too difficult to tell, leaving plot holes until the very end. Also there are still questions unanswered: is this all about(moon)love? Or altering history?

But the reason to stick to the first episode is because for the first time I feel YJH is to be pity.

However the intense climate to the movie will leave many viewers walking away head bowed and slightly traumatised by its conclusion.The movie 'The Scarlet Letter', is one of the many Korean movies that is finding an audience in the west. With Hollywood churning out clone after clone of various genre movies, this Asian invasion could not have come at a better time. It is comforting to know that somewhere creative and challenging cinema is still being produced and distributed.The story of 'The Scarlet Letter' involves a cop, Ki Hoon, who whilst investigating a murder re ignites a fling with his lover. The actual case that he is solving serves more as a backdrop with the main story focusing on the marital paradigmn between the protagonist, his wife and the lover.The idea of a hardworking cop being torn between his devotions to the one he loves and duty may not seem like the most original premise. Many a cop movie series has been devoted to such scenarios, movies like Micheal Mann's 'Heat' or 'Leathal Weapon' spring to mind. Yet what raises this movie above the average cop thriller is the frightening way Asian cinema is able to change the mood of a movie from one frame to another.This is now a hall mark of Asian cinema and is rooted in a tradition whereby genres such as comedy, horror, romance and thrillers can be mixed all together in one movie, take Japanese (Kitano) or Hong Kong (John Woo) cinema as examples. For the last fifteen years Asian cinema has been producing genre defying movies. Korea has now entered into the fray and are producing movies where suspense, romance and terror can be weaved into a narrative and still retain a sense of realism. This is what Hollywood is failing to achieve, with too many Hollywood movies reliant on staple genres and archetype heroes.After a brief respite Asia is once again paving a way for modern cinema to develop and surprisingly Korea seems to be the next port of call for the attention of the movie loving west.A difficult movie to watch, but one that is worthy of your attention."}, "1132": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Wonderful acting, brilliant writing, and great, classical music. One can't help but appreciate classical music that much more after seeing this series. Poetic, sad, dramatic, hilarious, and humane, I loved the high quality involved in this production.The story involves violinist Doo Roo mi (Lee Ji ah)who hires Maestro Kang Gun woo to lead an orchestra that has recently disbanded due to a former manager running off with all the money. She hires replacements for the orchestra, which consist of mostly amateurs, country bumpkins, and misfits with a dream to perform at a band. Amongst the members is a trumpeter who has the same name as Kang Gun woo (Jang Geun seok), who may prove to be a musical genius.Kim Myung Min's portrayal of the perfectionist and arrogant Maestro Kang Gun woo is both maddening and hilarious. Maestro Kang's scathing aggressiveness and sharp tongue exudes frank, sometimes admirable, efficiency and cold calculation. Things that come out of his mouth causes people to run off, break down, and cry. Carrying the nickname Orchestra Killer (because orchestra members tend not to stick around longer than six months under him), this character has a hard time dealing with regular people as he himself doesn't see himself as regular.Despite the fact that Maestro Kang treats his orchestra like trash, we find that he is actually a very complex character. Adding to the complexity are the orchestra members' own personal, social, and financial issues, and a love triangle between the two Kang Gun woo and Doo Roo mi.Be sure to check this out on DVD or Hulu."}, "1372": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "One misadventure was the beginning of the drama which lies ahead for two young people.

This drama certainly had the exact formula that made so many other K dramas a success.Then why is it not recognized on par with other K dramas out there? It's simple; the aim of this drama was to entertain. Unfortunately, there was no gimmick.Lee Dong Gun and Han Ji Hye did a wonderful job as a couple that were just beginning to get used to each other. The level of love and respect they show each other, as well as the hilarious scenes highlighting their comedic abilities, are believably sugary sweet. It brilliantly stuck to it's roots, keeping true to both the comedy and romantic aspect of it's genre. The romance and the hardships of marriage were mushy, gushy, sappy... and oh so adorable.There were no sticky love triangles or detailed misunderstandings that often frustrate viewers. Every single character (with the exception of perhaps, Lee Da Hae's humorous villain Moon Ga young) was realistically portrayed. It beautifully captured both the traditions and teachings of old with the fast paced life of the new. Korean tradition was brilliantly captured and respected; not mocked as it so often is in other drama. The action scenes were perhaps a bit silly to watch (matrix style jumps typical of K drama\u0085 which only added to the humor) but were also realistically portrayed.And\u0085 that's why it failed. Every single successful K drama has a gimmick, a enticing point that showed viewers that it was definitely different. No one died of cancer in this drama, no one cried for  episodes straight, no one cheated, and no one stole lied manipulated the other. There was no famous pop star\u0085 there wasn't a famous transformation that made recent drama's like Coffee Prince a favorite.

It didn't work for me. The heroine with the superpowers spent way too much of her time looking helplessly cute and befuddled, a victim of badly contrived circumstances. One would expect a young woman of , with superhuman strength, from a family of women with similar powers, to be more than dithering ditz. Perhaps it develops in the later episodes, but it wasn't worth taking the time to see if it got better. Her one good scene was the job negotiation scene, but after that flash of spirit she regressed to a befuddled clueless fool. Speaking of clothes   the expected stylishness of the characters was, as usual in K drama, excellent.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Strong Woman Do Bong Soon is a hilarious rom com, with an undertone of gender issues. The show has the usual elements of k drama: the rich, good looking chaebol; his cold, antagonistic family; the sassy girl; the love triangle; and the boy gets girl story after overcoming difficulties, but it managed to be so much more.The plot: Do Bong Soon (Park Bo Young) is a woman, who's born with superhuman strength. The Force runs through the female line in her family. It can only be used for good or she can lose her strength forever like her mother did. She loves her father who is a gentle warm character, and her twin brother, Do Bong Ki, who works as a doctor in a hospital. Bong Soon can't find a suitable job, but she wants to be a game developer. There are two other men in her life. One is her childhood friend, Guk Doo, a stern police detective played by Ji Soo. She has a secret crush on him. Also she hides her strength around him, since he claims to have a soft spot for tiny, fragile women, just like Bong Soo seems to be at first sight. The other man is Ahn Min Hyuk (Park Hyung Sik) the lanky, baby faced CEO of AIN SOFTware, a gaming company. One day he witnesses Bong Soon's superpowers against a group of gangsters, and he hires her to be his personal bodyguard to protect him against a mysterious caller, who has been making death threats against him. At the same time a serial kidnapper starts taking tiny, fragile women off the streets. Guk Doo wants to catch him, Bong Soon comes to his aid. Can she help both men to track down the culprits? The Good: this show is a wonderful blend of slapstick comedy, old fashioned romance and a refreshing look at gender roles. First there's a hidden message in the story, that loving a strong woman makes you a better man. It works that way for ages in the Matriarchy that is the Do Dynasty. Second there's a subplot about the young chaebol, who pretends to be gay. This image helps him with free publicity, protects him against unwanted female attention, and last but not least: keeps his lovely Peanut King Kong close by his side without alarming her. He even teases her with his supposed attraction to Guk Doo, saying he has a nice butt. His male secretary really seems to be gay, but not out of the closet yet, and the male office manager is openly gay trying to get his dear master into his nail painted clutches. Also the show makes fun of the Korean Patriarchy: the police office, the youth gang, the gangster mob in the neighborhood, and the patriarch of the chaebol's family, they are all absurdly dysfunctional. The Bad: there aren't many flaws IMO, but tastes differ. I find the romance very sweet, but it could be old fashioned and slow paced to others. The slapstick elements, and multiple use of sound effects, are not everyone's cup of tea, but I liked it. See for example the scene with a drunken Bong Soon urging her boss to 'log out', meaning 'to come out' with the sound effect of a computer logging out. Finally I don't like to see the women molester, but I can understand his impact in this drama.So I give Strong Woman Do Bong Soon a  out of , because I like the story lines, the action, and the actors are well matched."}, "410": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "317": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "759": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "199": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "262": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "619": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "168": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1169": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "The film starts off with the suicidal main character being interrogated by the police.

It mirrors my own experience so closely. The calling game, the little games you play with each other that could lead to misunderstandings and fights. And all this because you are afraid of the strong feelings you have for another person. Not knowing how to express it or how the other person feels about you.

At the time, it was a bit refreshing for a K drama, both for its unusual premise and excellent incorporation of manga drawings and anime scenes throughout the series.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Hana is a talented but reclusive Japanese manga artist who takes an interest in the lives of an elderly neighbor lady and the elderly gentleman who hand sweeps the street outside her home every morning at  am. One day, the gentleman passes away, and Hana's family is tasked by the community to take care of his estate and remains since he has no family. The lady soon shows up however to abscond with the ashes of the gentleman who forever swept her street. Fascinated by these  people, Hana sets off to find out more about their relationship. During her journey, she uncovers a  year love story between the lady and gentleman. She then tries to tell their love story in the form of her new manga series with the help of some other characters that show up along the way.This series started off exceptionally well, and, I was quickly taken in by its subtle and unique method of storytelling. Unfortunately, it hits a wall HARD during the middle to latter half of its run time, as it falls back on so many tired clich\u00e9 driven subplots and typical overly forced melodrama. I really wanted to skull punch the people in charge for practically ruining it all. I sometimes wish I had some all encompassing authority or magical ability to edit these shows as I see fit before they air; this is absurd of course, and, I do realize the nature of, and time constraints involved with, airing KTV shows which must fulfill a certain number of predetermined episodes. I'm rambling on here, but the basic problem with this show is that it is an excellent story that is stretched out way longer than it should be.There is a lot to like about this series though: The epic love story mystery at the core is interesting, and the efforts of Hana and her cohorts to bring this story to life while dealing with their own love interests and problems along the way is often entertaining. Also, the drawings and animation utilized throughout the series are superbly implemented, and, the  main leads stars are all quite good actors actresses. I really liked the soundtrack too; the title song and the dramatically cued love song are both still stuck in my head after all these years, and that's saying something! I also did very much like the final episode and how the series ended overall.The main problem with this series is that it's simply too long. As a result, the forced melodramatic nonsense gets out of hand as the series progresses, before it finally gets back on track. All of the characters are quite likable to begin with, but their melodramatic de evolution makes you end up not wanting to like any of them. Here's a breakdown of the  main characters:. Hana. She's shy, introverted, and doesn't like people or believe in love. She avoids interacting with the world and finds solace only in her drawings. She supposed to slowly start to emerge from her shell as the series progresses, and she does, but she also spends a lot of time just being cold and sullen, before the show finds its footing again.. Hana's love interest. This guy is a handsome young resourceful dude who has a knack for storytelling and interacting with people. He helps Hana come out of her shell as they both work towards completing the new manga, and, they begin to fall in love with each other along the way. Unfortunately, he also spends a good number of episodes throwing violent temper tantrums and whining a lot. At one point, he literally spends   full episodes as a drunkard who does nothing but cry nonstop.. The doctor psychiatrist. He's a very successful and good looking MD, and a highly reasonable man. He happens to be a huge closet manga fan, and, he possesses a gigantic stash of same that's hidden in an awesome secret room which he escapes to in order to relax with his hobby. He's a big fan of Hana's work as well, and, he soon becomes smitten with her when they meet face to face due to a series of events. His love for Hana is clearly misplaced, which would be OK if he didn't end up coming across as more of an obsessed and creepy stalker more than anything else. . The woman who produces the manga series (probably my favorite character). She's an attractive single woman that is focused on her career as an independent producer. She's hard working, and very good at what she does, and she's a perfect match for the doc referenced above that she has a crush on. It's perfectly clear that she and the doc should be together, but he's obsessed with Hana at this point, and there's no reasoning with him. So, she reacts accordingly and spends a lot of time just being a manipulative woman who pulls whatever strings she needs to in order to get what she wants (both professionally and personally).This synthetic melodrama really drives me crazy! Why are the writers and director intentionally trying to make us hate these characters?...NEWS FLASH: This does not make the show any better or more watchable, and it actually does the exact opposite. I'm perfectly fine if the melodrama flows naturally, but if not, DON'T FORCE IT! You've practically ruined what could have been an excellent show because of your mistaken belief that more melodrama ALWAYS equals better series. IT DOES NOT!If you're going to watch this show, I recommend skipping over episodes   or thereabouts; you'll be glad if you do.So, . . out of  stars.

One of the big advantages of these shows is the fact that they are series that usually run for just one season. As so many shows these days get cancelled on cliffhangers, you don't run any risk of that happening with a K drama.The series i am about to review, D Day, is one of those shows you just have to binge watch. Yes, it really is that good. In D Day the capital city of Seoul gets hit by a violent earthquake. It then focuses on the brave men and women of the rescue services and a hospital that are left behind to deal with the effects of the aftermath.Let's first talk about the special effects on this show. Usually effects on TV shows are mediocre at best, simply because of budget restraints. However that was definitely not noticeable on D day, because when the earthquake strikes, it can stand up to the effects used in big Hollywood blockbuster movies. Even more striking are the effects that are used more subtly throughout the show, like small cracks on roads and buildings. All these help to make you believe that there really has been an earthquake that destroyed most of Seoul.However it is not the effects that makes this show so great. No that right is reserved for the wonderful cast of characters and the actors that portray them. Every single character, from the main characters to the lowest sub characters, has it's role to play in the unfolding drama. The lead character is doctor Lee Hae Sung, a doctor who is known to be reckless in his pursuit of saving human lives. The natural charisma of him (a credit to actor Young  wang Kim) makes you rooting for everything he does all throughout the show. He is soon joined in the series by the young female doctor Jung Ddol mi, another character you will fall in love with as the series progresses. She provides most of the comic relief, a thing that is well needed in what would otherwise be a pretty bleak and depressing show.

However my review would not be complete to not at least mention the hospital director Park Gun. I don't think i have ever seen a person that i hated more in a TV series than this loathsome man. Trust me when i say that you will come to hate him as well. But oh wow, is he played well by actor Kyeong yeong Lee.The series will take you on a roller coaster trip throughout a total of  episodes. It will make you laugh, cry and sit on the edge of your seat, and once you start it will be hard to stop watching it. Is the show perfect? No of course not. Yes there are some moments in the show that feel forced, or in which there are some overacted scenes of emotions. I also read some reviews that did not like the ending of the series. That of course is, as it is with most things, a matter of opinion. I for one loved the ending, which i am not going to be spoiling here.Overall though i loved this show and give it a  out of  score."}, "1277": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "386": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "530": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "I appreciate very much the efforts of LBH to act in different genre of movies.

That's why people experience loneliness even in a crowd.Furthermore, Among these people, the android robot is designed to listen to people until the end, help the weak, and comfort the crying. He is a very humane robot living among inhumane people, that raises the question of what it means to be human.

I've always been a fan of time travel, whether it be in movies, TV shows or other. I'm not going to rant about errors vis a vis the time travel blah blah blah, or the logistics of it. After all, it's fantasy, and should be accepted as such. So the writers executives, whoever it was, came up with this great idea for a show. Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there. Someone, in all their wisdom, decides that it must go on for  x   hour episodes. The problem is that, I get the feeling this decision was made long before the knowledge or guarantee, if you like, that the show actually needed those  episodes. So the writers are left with the task of prolonging this fantastic idea to the point where it becomes boring frustrating annoying. I can forgive them for the time travel errors, cause that's just fantasy, but the moronic characters and dialogue, this I cannot. I'm also amazed by the technical abilities of mobile phones in South Korea, apparently, they can pick up dialogue with crisp quality from at least  yards away when shooting video. I wonder if writers will ever stray from the 'cliche' of ending an episode on a cliff hanger, in the vain hope that viewers will just have to watch the next installment. I know, and this may sound radical, but why don't they just concentrate on writing a good script, draw in the viewers, make them sit on the edge of their seat? Not bore them for  minutes then throw a spanner in the works in the final  minutes like some kind of bait.This could have been fantastic as, let's say,  x  hour episodes. I'm guessing at this point, because I reached episode  and concluded that  x  hour shows would have sufficed up til now. I won't be watching anymore, I really tried to give it a fair shot. To say I am disappointed would be an understatement of gargantuan proportions. I've watched other Korean shows (My girlfriend is a gumiho , My love from the star , Master's sun, oh my Venus etc) and found them all to be very enjoyable, or at least, made me watch til the end. As for this festering refuse, I will never know how it ends, and it's something that doesn't bother me at all, I'm just upset that it's taken me  episodes to realise that I was wasting my time.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "I'm glad I watched this.

I don't want to bash this show too hard, as I want to try to be objective, and the series does have a few good things going for it; It's an interesting premise to base a show on, and I appreciated its attempt to try to convey a more darkly themed love story compared to the norm for KTV melodramas. There are several solid romantic and dramatic moments, and many sad ones, throughout, but you'll have to wade through a considerable amount of filler and nonsense to get to them. Ultimately, there are just too many issues that affect this show for it to be considered one of the better Korean melodramas.SPOILERS AHEAD!So, where did it go wrong?...I'll tell you: The primary problem with this show is that it simply can't sustain its  episode length. I frequently complain about Asian productions being way lengthier than they need be, but this series might be the most egregious offender of this issue that I've ever seen. As a result, its pacing is often incredibly sloooowwww! This is a constant and reoccurring problem that effects this show on every level; several episodes don't progress the story at all, plot lines seem to drag along indefinitely, etc. This issue even manifests itself in many individual scenes; someone will say or do something and a good  seconds or so will go by before the other party responds, characters frequently reminisce or stare off into the distance for an interminable amount of time, etc. This all becomes excruciating to bear with as the series plays out, and I frequently found myself begging for something anything to happen, or for someone to do or say something, in order to get this show moving along at a more expedient pace. I understand this is supposed to be a slow burn dramatic tale, but that's no excuse for it to be a tedious and boring watch (which it often is).The premise of this revenge love story is intriguing, but could they not think of a better way to implement it?...Essentially, this story involves a male lead character who wants to get revenge for his older brother's suicide (which he blames on the actress his older brother was in love with). Let's set aside the fact that any reasonable person would realize that this is not the fault of the actress, and just assume that the younger brother is filled with blind compassion and rage for his beloved brother. The only problem with this is that he hasn't seen his brother in over a decade, and he barely seems to know or care about him at all, so, it's rather unbelievable that he would be completely consumed with avenging him all of a sudden (despite how this show tries to explain to you why he is, via flashbacks to when they were younger).In order to exact his revenge, the lead character decides to get close to the actress by becoming her personal bodyguard. Why not just walk up to her and say Hi, I'm the younger brother of the guy you loved, and he's had a very bad accident, can we discuss the situation? He could have easily gotten close to her that way, instead of using this absurdly contrived bodyguard plot. Nevertheless, he somehow manages to become her bodyguard; I guess background checks were not a requirement, since the people who hired him have no problem with the fact that he has no experience, don't bother to make a simple inquiry to discover he was the brother of the guy they were trying to keep away from the actress, and don't seem to care that he's a violent and unstable psychopath who shakes down people on the street for money when he's not busy losing club fights on purpose. What, was Hannibal Lecter unavailable for the position?...Jeesh!There are a couple of secondary stories as well, the most prominent of which involves an heir of a major company wanting to marry the actress. This story line is absurd and unnecessary; the sole reason as to why these  characters should must be married is essentially based on a single innocuous misunderstanding that could easily be rectified by reasonable adults...sadly, the writers are children and thought otherwise!As for your actors; there's basically only  main roles: Shin Min A plays the part of the actress. She's usually does pretty solid work, and she does what's asked of her here well enough, but this is not a role that does her any favors. Rain plays the lead here; he has legions of fans, but at the risk of being beaten to death by a bunch of fan girls, I'm just going to say it: He's not that great of an actor, and I've been less than impressed with many of the roles I've seen him in. His range primarily consists of being angry, sad, distant, or goofy (with, seemingly, very little room in between). He's certainly good looking, athletic, likable, and, he can do a wide variety of things, but IMO, he's lacking the nuances and subtleties needed at this stage of his career (now ), in order to be considered the preeminent new wave actor that so many people once claimed him to be.This show wants to be an epic sad love tale meets revenge story, but it's not! Instead, it's an overwrought and underwhelming melodrama that features an unlikeable main lead and some badly contrived story lines. If it were   episodes long, and helmed by a more solid writing team, it could have been a lot better. Ultimately though, it never rises above the level of being just a mediocre soap opera at best.Bottom line:  out of  stars. If you are looking for a Korean melodrama of a similar vein, there are many other shows to choose from that are far better than this one.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "I had extremely high hopes for this series as it's Rain's newest work and since I have seen Full House and Sang Doo! Let's Go To School which I thought were outstanding, I didn't expect anything less   in fact I expected it to be a life changing thing! Haha. I was worried that I was going to be disappointed because I had such high hopes but it amazed me and managed to blow me away.Using non verbal communication, you can tell from the cover that it's very serious, Rain's character is going to be very cold, and just from the title you know that the story is going to be exciting and epic.Even though it's not the first time this kind of story has been done, it still seems so original because it seemed so fresh.The thing I enjoyed the most was seeing a completely different side of Rain. If you're a Rain fan from such series as Full House, don't expect to see the sweet and gentle Young Jae you saw. Rain's character, Bok Gu, is cold, UNBELIEVABLY smooth and has the attractive 'bad boy' attitude. After watching this, I was convinced that Rain can act any role because he just nailed this character. There is nothing worse than when you're watching a film or series and you don't care about the characters. You won't find that in this \u0096 you will genuinely care about the characters, pity them, hate them, understand them, be frustrated with them and fall in love with them.You also cannot ignore the incredible music used in this. The music alone touched me and broke my heart   it was so effective. A superb soundtrack.Girls must watch this series for the excitement of the development of the  lovers' relationship and see what ending will come out of this completely against fate scenario. And most importantly, in all seriousness, no joke, Rain's handsomeness. The shots used for all the characters were done so unbelievably well \u0096 I melted every time Rain came on screen.Guys \u0096 get ready for a new role model. There is also so much action in this \u0096 it's more than a drama. Also, follow all the courting steps in this series and you will melt any girl's heart you desire.All the cast's acting skills were generally extremely good but hands down to Rain who once again holds nothing back and always gives it his all.The ending is beautiful and at first you may find it very unsatisfying because you needed more closure but I was thinking about this series for days (along with tears \u0096 yes it was also very sad, heartbreaking and really touching) after I finished watching it and I found that I loved it more and more.

It's basically a musically themed melodrama about some young people.SPOILERS AHEAD!The story centers on the prestigious Kirin Arts Academy; a school devoted entirely to taking young talented performers and turning them into future star musicians, dancers, singers, etc. It's not easy getting into this school, but if you do, you'll be trained night and day to realize your potential.Enter our young aspiring artists. They come from differing backgrounds with varying experience and talents. They all try out to be accepted by the school; some make the cut and some don't for various reasons. One girl that fails to get accepted is given a chance to earn a special exception if she can bring in a couple of other students one of the teachers wants to train. Everybody soon converges together, and the story quickly focuses on the  young primary characters;  girls and  boys, some of which have made the cut, and some of which are trying to get in through the back door.The characters are forced to get to know each other, and have to work together to accomplish their goals (or work against each other as is sometimes the case). Some grow in life over time as individuals, others fall prey to the emotional pitfalls of success and failure. Along the way, some friendships are born and others are crushed, romantic interests are explored, and so forth. This is all very typical stuff for this type of genre, and, it's done competently enough to be a solid melodrama all on its own. All this is set against the backdrop of their individual talents & the arts school though, and, that is where the show really shines.Prior to watching this show, I already was aware that the  lead characters were actually fairly accomplished young musicians, dancers, and or singers, in real life. There's a number of musical set pieces and performances throughout the show, and the  leads had no problem delivering the goods in that aspect when called upon. Actually, I was much more concerned if these people could really act, than I was worried they'd be able to pull off the musical numbers. Amazingly, they're all more than acceptable actors and actresses in their specific roles, and some of them gave quite good performances in regards. Overall: Fantastic Job Everyone!I wouldn't actually classify this show as a musical; there are only but a few song & dance numbers (if that many) that spontaneously break out. Almost all of the musical performances are done within the context of story (i.e. during practice, stage events, try outs, scheduled performances, etc). There's also only a handful of instances of one of the cast members singing to another one, but that's about it. The way the musical performances are incorporated makes for real nice blend to the overall story. Neither part of these differing show aspects interferes with, or outweighs, the other; this is an important part in making this show work successfully as a whole, and, it was all handled with a good deal of aplomb throughout.There's a number of other secondary characters and story lines during this show's  episode run. Other artists come and go as guest stars, the school and teachers are focused on some, people's lives and families are looked at, etc. It's mostly all serviceably to effectively accomplished.What could be improved here?...not much (if anything). Asking to tone down the melodrama a bit is just not going to happen with these KTV shows, so deal with it. I suppose the production company could spring for some space heaters for everybody on the set of a winter time KTV show in order to keep their young stars from freezing to death.Bottom Line: This show is definitely geared towards a younger audience than I, but that didn't stop me from liking it anyway, and, I liked it a lot actually. It's enjoyable, and, it is quite good overall. The cast and crew of Dream High II has certainly got their work cut out for them if they want to be on par with this show. out of  stars!...Well Recommended!"}, "902": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "34": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "192": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "535": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "293": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "54": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "This drama super good, all the actors did a great job especially the main actors.

Son Ye jin as Kae i. She has excellent chemistry with Lee Min ho and they clicked as a couple. Her doormat character was annoying in the initial episodes, cute and charming in the middle, then a bit sad in the final episode where she offers him blind trust in the form of herself. The emotional payoff is in their epilogue scenes.. Jung Sung Hwa as Sang Jun. He is Jin ho's friend. He is funny impersonating Jin ho's gay lover. I was horrified that the writers pair him with the despicable In hee in the final episode, lazy storytelling.. Ryu Seung ryong as Do bin. As the quiet, lonely director, this actor embodies this character with human kindness and is an emotional touchstone.What I did not like about Personal Taste:. Wang Ji Hye as In Hee. Supposedly Kae I's friend but she is selfish, willing to use and abuse to get her way. This annoying character had no growth during the series. . Ahn Seok Hwan as Yun Seop (Chang Ryeol's Dad). I loved this actor in Delightful Girl Chun hyang but here he portrays a one dimensional annoying character that sneers, bribes, and bullies his way through life.. Choi Eun Seo as Hye Mi. Another annoying character that believes she has a chance with Jin ho. Worthless and whining, the script this character was given was a waste."}, "692": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "994": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "Good cast, particutly Uhm Tae Woong who i will add to my list of asian actors I admire.

Not so fast though! Husband abruptly quits his bread winning job to try to start his own business, wife tries to support him while running the household & paying the bills, tensions rise as they fall deeper in debt with no hope in sight, etc. Eventually, wife gets fed up with what little husband is offering to the marriage, so she divorces him.A decade later, ex husband has since become hugely successful with his business startup, and this makes ex wife more than a little resentful. She sets out to get even and make his life miserable while planning to make him regret that he let her get away. In order to accomplish her task, she takes a job as an intern at his company in order to get close to him and set her plan in motion. What she fails to realize though is that he's still bitter that she didn't stick by him years ago, and he's equally determined to now make her jealous of his new found fame & success.The premise here is fairly modest and easy to follow. Two former spouses each still have some feelings, both good and bad, for the other. Now that they're older (and sometimes wiser), you observe their push and pull relationship unfold in typical K drama fashion; first they try to get back at each other for past slights, then they get over it and start to move on, then they grow to understand each other better and consider starting over together if it's meant to be. It couldn't be any more simplistic or orderly, and as a result, the first part of the show is mostly comedy drama, second part is mainly regular drama, and final part is primarily melodrama with some romance and maybe love along the way.Lee Min Jung & Joo Sang Wook play the two lead characters. Both performers are in their prime and they have no problems handling their respective roles. Joo Sang Wook is a highly amusing just to look at when he's portraying his younger self, complete with atrocious hair style. He's pretty effective throughout as his modern day eligible bachelor self, who's still a bit dorky and unsure of his feelings underneath. Lee Min Jung has primarily been taking on a number of these similarly themed K drama female roles in the last several years, and she is quite good at this stuff; she has a nice comedic touch to go along with all the other attributes expected of a lead actress in this type of role.Potentially standing in the way of our estranged couple at every turn is the  stereotypical chaebol family members that comprise this story's antagonists & other potential love interests; they include the self serving family patriarch with typical ego & pride, the carefree handsome young son who likes the female lead, and the wounded older daughter who likes the male lead. They are all pretty standard characters for a K drama; the Dad is somewhat emotionally distant and primarily obsessed with his own legacy, the son is perpetually stuck at the age of a boy trying to become a man, and the daughter can't get over a tragedy that happened to her in the past. Each of these family members is intended to be a sympathetic figure to some degree while simultaneously irking the viewer on numerous occasions.The first couple episodes focus on the leads as their younger selves, and are used mostly for background and setup purposes. Then, the two leads get re acquainted with one another again in the present where the rest of the series takes place. Things are kept pretty lighthearted and are rolling along pretty well for a while until the tone of the series begins to shift, and it's all mostly melodrama from there on in. The tonal shift was not unexpected, but it just reeks of too much familiarity that suggests it's coasting down the standard K drama checklist of scenes to accomplish in order to wrap up and move on to another show, and that is my primary problem with this show.I love the Hallyu entertainment industry in most all its forms, but I'm often baffled by how reluctant they seem to be to take a chance on something new, particularly when they would clearly be so good at it. This is especially true when it comes to Korean TV shows, as you basically have variety reality programming and stuff like this show, and very little else. I know these shows are under enormous pressure to simply churn out copy, hit a certain ratings number, and cover all the bases as best as possible...but, I can't help but think this show would have been fantastic as primarily a romantic comedy from start to finish, and, I know I'm not the only one who thinks this. There must surely be a market for KTV viewers who could do without another cookie cutter melodrama that insists on falling back on typical characters and clich\u00e9s in order to tell a story. And, if given a chance, I'm sure the writers of this show could have figured out a way to include an appropriate amount of love, loss, & melodrama without invoking the same tired and silly antagonist & love interest angles.Summary: I don't mean to come across as being too harsh on this particular show, It's not that bad at all, and I will recommend it. But, it is one of those K dramas that makes me long for the day when the heavens align to allow for each particular KTV show to just do what it does best, and leave the formulaic one size fits all status quo method of storytelling behind.Bottom Line:  out of  stars on the K drama scale."}, "1212": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1237": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1375": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "Not a big fan of these K dramas, watch them more with the spouse as a window on the culture.

Seen on a weekly basis it must have been a hoot to wonder which one would be packing this time. Word to the wise   people have to talk on TV, it is more like radio, the screen is too small for big action or scenery, and there's none of that here, Shanghai and Seoul are seen in dull overcast skies.

Starring the rather lovely Song Hye kyo, playing an internet novelist and the curiously monikered Rain as a wildly popular young movie star, on the one hand it's a good example of the quirky mix of slapstick comedy interspersed with rather sobering moments of heartbreak and frustration experienced by the characters. The surprising fact is that the first episode follows a similar plot line to House of Sand and Fog, which certainly wasn't a comedy and was absolutely full of despair. Girl inherits lovely house on the coast from parents, struggles financially, circumstances lead to her losing most of her possessions and having her home sold off underneath her feet, new owner has little sympathy at first. That's fortunately where the comparison ends! Plenty of moments of Song Hye kyo screwing her face up in disgust by some awkward thing she's said or done, and Rain (wearing his rather strange low cut male cleavage shirts) glancing into the ether whilst biting his lip do eventually lead to a building relationship between a very odd couple.

The story follows  main characters; two show Producing Directors (PD's) in their mid thirties, a younger PD intern, and a young singer idol, that all work in the Korean entertainment industry in some capacity. The show follows the personal & professional lives of these people, and those people around them, while mixing comedy, romance, and drama amongst them.'The Producers' starts off a little unevenly but everything settles in quickly enough, and this show really takes off during episodes  however, it is important to mention that this show also changed directors around this time (in what has to be one of the most ironic cases of life imitating art I've ever seen). There is a change in tone that comes with the change of directors, but it's not unusual for K dramas to have tonal shifts like this anyway. I rather liked the basic groundwork the first director implemented, but I really enjoyed where the second director took the story once the baton was passed.The main cast is great. The  older PD's are played by actor Cha Tae Hyun and actress Gong Hyo Jin. The young PD intern is played by actor Kim Soo Hyun, and the idol singer is played by idol singer IU. If you don't recognize all  of these people, you're not paying nearly enough attention to the Korean entertainment industry as you should be. Tae Hyun & Hyo Jin are both highly experienced and seemingly so at ease with any role they are tasked with; as expected, they each do very good work here, both separately and together, and they play off one other extremely well. As for the younger stars; all the Korean girls know who Soo Hyun is by now, and every Korean under the age of  knows who IU is at this point. I particularly enjoyed watching these two play mostly against type; he as the shy & awkward guy, and she as the alter ego version of her own public persona.Supporting cast is rock solid, as is the story, writing, direction, production values, and just about everything else going on with this show. The soundtrack is terrific and very well implemented, and the endless amount of guest stars, cameos, name dropping, career stories, inside jokes, and so forth, is nothing short of spectacular. The camera angles can be a bit off putting at times due to the purposeful intent to portray a typical K drama as some sort of reality show about people working on reality showsit's often reminiscent to how the British American show 'The Office' was shot in this aspect.The last K drama I can think of that was similarly hyped as 'The Producer' was 'You Who Came From The Stars', and ironically, both shows feature Kim Soo Hyun in a leading role. Both shows share a common quality aside from that actor though, and that is they are each somewhat polarizing Love It or Hate It type shows. I wasn't particularly a fan of 'You Who Came From The Stars', though I didn't outright hate it nor did I give it a scathing review. I've heard and read a lot of comments from many viewers who loved 'YWCFTS' (and similar type shows) however, that just do not like 'The Producers' at all; they find 'The Producers' boring, not melodramatic enough, don't like how Soo Hyun's character is portrayed, etcthey don't think 'The Producers' is as good as everyone thinks it is. But, these people are wrong, because 'The Producers' is goodreally good.This show seems not to care which direction the audience wants the show to go in...it's going to tell its story the way they want. Of course, if the ratings would have stunk, that wouldn't have been the case. I like this approach A LOT and I'd like to see it done more often. It pleases me greatly that this show was well received by many viewersnot just because I liked it and want others to agree, but because Korean TV desperately needs dramas like this to be successful. I've always felt that more diversity was in order within the K drama world, and this show is quite different from the norm in so many ways. It still retains a K drama feel and format, but I think this could be a pivotal show in helping change the industry for the better. Not every K drama show needs to be (virtually) the same story over and over again in order to be accepted, and KTV land might find an audience they never even knew existed if they continue to try taking a more intelligent and adult approach to some of these shows. As for those of you who didn't like the show for the reasons mentioned in the previous paragraphGet over it!...There are hundreds of shows that fit your preferred criteria both past & present, and I can assure you that's not going to change (nor should it) anytime soon.Summary: Personally, I loved it!...There's no question it's quite well done overall, and it is jammed packed full of extra goodies for long time fans of the Korean entertainment industry. And, if you happen to like both Korean variety reality shows & K dramas, it's a real treat. It might not work all that well for the younger generation or those expecting a traditional K drama format; it is often dialogue heavy, story driven, and very light on the flashiness and epic love story melodrama.

It's a romantic fantasy themed melodrama that has become very popular in this medium over the last decade or so.This show pulled huge ratings and was a smashing success for its creators. It follows a virtual can't miss formula for this genre (i.e. good looking actors & actresses in a star crossed love story). The writers of this show certainly know their target audience, and, they delivered exactly what was expected. If you're not part of the target audience however (i.e. guys, people above a certain age, or those that are simply looking for a superbly woven story), this show might not be suited for you.There's a heavy emphasis on catering to fan girls throughout this series. This show is basically geared towards young women and it provides a very non threatening view of relationships accordingly. There's nothing wrong with this, but, I think anyone expecting otherwise should be aware of this from the outset. The female lead basically serves as a proxy for viewers to identify with; she lives the lavish fantasy life style complete with various trials and tribulations to overcome. Meanwhile, there are  handsome rich guys for her to choose from; one is the aforementioned alien & main love interest, the other is her childhood friend that dotes on her endlessly. In an indication of how safe this show is for young female viewers, the alien love interest is still a virgin and can't even kiss a woman without fainting. He can't handle alcohol either, but he does happen to have chivalrous values, super powers to protect our heroine, and a rockin' set of abs.The childhood friend represents Plan B for our heroine if things don't work out with the alien. He's walking a very fine line between nice guy that will always be there for her vs. obsessive stalker that won't leave her alone. This guy's older brother portrays the villain from central casting; he's good looking too, but in a fashionably evil way. He plays your typical Chaebol heir lunatic that must control everything while eliminating everybody that gets in the way, and, this show goes to great lengths to let you know he's the bad guy every time he appears on screen; he's involved in a number of murder mystery sub plots that soon finds him facing off against our two leads.Jun Ji Hyun (Gianna Jun) and Kim Soo Hyun are your two leads; she's the eccentric and conceited top Korean actress, he's the noble alien from Planet Korean Hunky Dude. Gianna Jun is a hugely successful Korean film star, but her presence and style of acting does seem somewhat ill suited for the small screen; she's a movie star that should be starring in movies, not playing stock KTV damsel in distress roles. Kim Soo Hyun is a star in the making, and seems to be a capable enough actor; he's given a predictable K drama male part as the stoic white knight. As such, he's allowed few opportunities to show much range that are afforded these types of roles. The two of them have worked together previously, and they complement each other nicely here. There's a bunch of supporting actors and actresses involved; some current and up and coming talent, along with several K drama veterans that all did what was asked, but several of these parts were under written and or non essential. Acting, overall, was solid throughout.As expected, production values are quite good, and this show comes complete with loads of stylishly beautiful people. Cohesive storytelling is sometimes lacking however; it's clear the writers were just making things up as they went along (which is not really all that uncommon for these shows), but they really pushed the limits on occasion here, and I found this to be quite irritating. The rules governing what will happen to the alien and what he can can't do are ever changing; his powers come and go when convenient to the plot, he's apparently not allowed to kill humans or he'll die too (yet he somehow managed to serve  years in the military throughout various wars without killing anyone), etc... Random side characters come and go too, without ever being appropriately developed within the overall story; the estranged father shows up just in time to donate blood to save his daughter, then he just disappears again for a while, and, I question the need to tie any of this story into the alien's first encounter with an earth girl. I know they were aiming for a fate destiny angle here, but that girl in the past really has nothing to do with the woman in the present other than looking similar to her. It's this kind of writing that is really annoying to me, and I see no reason why the writers couldn't still appease their target audience while tightening up the story some. And, while I see many people liked the ending, I can't help but point out that it practically negates the importance of everything that occurred prior to it.Summary: This will be well received by the crowd it's aimed at. It's not blatantly immature and has enough decent moments for viewers outside of the in crowd to enjoy...I found the little st person vignettes throughout the show to be a particularly nice touch. Still, it should have been way better than what it was, and, it could have had the best of both worlds if the producers writers were willing & able to try a little harder to appeal to a wider audience.Bottom Line: For the right audience, it's   out of  stars.

It's another poor girl meets rich boy Korean melodrama. Korean television will tell this same story over and over again until the end of time, and, lord knows I've seen a crap ton of these shows to say the least. Summary Verdict: this one's not bad.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Ha Ji won plays Gil Ra im; a poor & humble stunt woman trying to make ends meet working in the movie industry. Hyun Bin plays Kim Joo won; a wealthy & arrogant heir to an upscale department store chain. Joo won mistakes Ra im as an actress his famous brother once dated, and as a result, they subsequently meet & spend some time together by accident. Need I even bother expounding?...comedy, romance, drama ensue. You know the format: she's the pretty but tough tomboyish type with no time for nonsense in her life, he's the straight laced rich guy who works hard but has plenty of time for whatever nonsense he wishes. The two meet and he begins to soon fall for her. She's less than impressed with him though, so he's got his work cut out for him. The tried and true staple of K drama loves stories is on full display here; he's constantly presented with a series of arranged dates to meet a future wife from the same ilk as his own family, but he's not interested in this and wants to find his own love. His stature and eligibility means he pursued by an endless supply of suitable beauties, so his ego is a bit unchecked in regards to what a great catch he thinks he is. As such, he is somewhat baffled by the fact that this lower class girl doesn't jump at the chance to be with him, couldn't care less about his standing, and won't give him the time of day. He's also never met any woman quite like this before in his life, and she's pretty easy to look at, so he's more than intrigued smitten determined etc. He therefore decides to use his power and wealth to intrude in her life in order to win her over, which initially backfires of course, until perhaps the  can eventually find some common ground to stand on if this relationship was meant to be.We're rolling right along with the standard fare for this genre over the first half dozen episodes or so; it's workable and kept fairly tight for the most part as the two leads come together bit by bit. It's all pretty much par for the course, then, BAM (SPOILERS); on a mountain biking date one day, the  stray off course and stumble upon a strange old shop & restaurant in the middle of nowhere. While there, they imbibe a magical potion which causes their souls to switch bodies. As such, a whole new layer to the proceedings then comes into play in this series.While this wacky out of nowhere plot aspect of the show may seem absurd (and it is, of course), it does actually work, and, it works quite well. It both helps to break up the status quo for a typical K drama, and, also serves to further benefit the story as well as a whole. These two characters were having a hard time developing a common ground & relationship the old fashioned way, so perhaps they will find love via this mystical method instead. Accordingly, the two opposites come to understand and appreciate each other more by spending time in each other's body life.The twist provides for a great deal of comedy to be mined here, as the CEO dude now has to lead the life of the poor tough girl, and stunt woman girl has to run a company and be subjected to high society pressures. While they've switched bodies, they also each take the opportunity to investigate the other, turn away the other's potential love interests, see each other's friends and siblings half naked, etc. It's all pretty cute. This is not without problems though, as each time it rains, the bodies are switched back and forth; so, there's a chance he might get caught in her body while trying to perform a risky stunt that he's ill prepared for, or she does something unknowingly that puts him in danger due to his health problems, etc.Eventually, the two leads get down to the business of trying to figure out how to stop switching bodies all the time, so they can get back to their normal lives before somebody finds out or something goes horribly wrong. With some help from their friends and family, and with a little luck, perhaps all will work out in the end, and maybe the two leads will be able to find love along the way. The cast all put in acceptable to solid work, and just about all characters are likable enough. Perhaps the best role is that of the CEO's brother; a K pop star known as Oska, who leads a mostly carefree life of luxury when he's not lamenting the loss of his true love that got away. The stunt woman has a huge fan crush on him that comically belies her no nonsense tough girl persona, to the point of her being elated with scoring concert tickets, sleeping in Oska themed socks, etc. And, though Oska competes with his brother to some degree, he mostly serves as an intermediary for the two leads while they work on their budding romance.All in all, this show is pretty solid. It doesn't go on forever (though it could have been trimmed a little), and it's kept pretty lighthearted for the most part; it's mostly a charming comedy romance drama, with little heavy handed evil plot villain schemes.

Lee Bum Soo is usual awesome with his character but his character is not the central one here, Im Zi Wan is OK but not that great since I barely can feel sorry for him which I supposed I have to since watching the plot the audiences should feel sorry for him but I don't really feel that but after all he is not bad. Baek Jin Hee is plain her acting like I summon you gold is almost similar I cannot expect much from her, while others are so so.The plot is OK and a bit boring since it's mostly about gambling and company power struggle and half of the story I can feel that the plot is changed whereas there should be  main characters then it's only has one which is Kim Jae Joong's character but it's OK since his acting improves a lot after Dr. Jin and Protect the boss, his sadness, his loneliness, his strong heart he gave his all this time and yes Kim Jae Joong should be the lead it's already the time if not because of those bias who said idols cannot acting. The ending is tragic yet happy one of the brother died you can guess who is it? The best soundtrack is sang by Kim Jae Joong, he conveys his feeling well into the lyrics as well since he wrote it himself. other ost are OK but unfortunately because Kim Jae Joong who was acting and singing at the same time for the drama ost so for other ost I cannot listen to it, well because Jae Joong is an amazing and talented singer.

Thirdly and the most importance for me is Eun Sung's acting (actress Shin Rin Ah): I'm in awe how the filming team managed a child, clever indeed, to perform a lot of brilliant scenes, to sustain long dialogues.

It's a matter of whether you treasure romance or friendship more and if you are up to taking the dive and find out the outcome of a relationship. It was as if while watching the drama you will also start to hesitate just like them and wonder whether to take the plunge. The pacing of the drama was smoothly done as we go along with the MCs in their discoveries. I really enjoy the performances of both MCs and their on screen chemistry is just right for the kind of relationship they are having in the drama. The music was just nice and the attraction of perusing French language also quite a sell to this drama.

Unless you've already watched the other  , you'd better pass this one.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "My Girlfriend is a Gumiho is a Korean televised melodrama that aired back in . I've seen a lot these types of shows over the years and this one's not bad. I won't heap the undeserved praise (my opinion) on it that the other two reviewers did, and I feel its current IMDb rating of . stars is a bit on the high side. Nevertheless, it is good enough and solidly watchable.SPOILERS AHEAD!If you don't know what a Gumiho is, you clearly haven't watched much Korean cinema. This is at least the th different Korean movie or show I can think of (just off the top of my head) that involves one; there are probably dozens more of these stories though. A Gumiho is a mythical creature in Korean folklore; a nine tailed fox to be precise. The most similar mythical creature I can compare it to in western culture is a mermaid, and that's because they are both usually beautiful enticing creatures with or without supernatural powers that may or may not lead to your doom if you happen upon one.Gumiho stories and mermaid stories have been overused to say the least, but both legends provide a wide ranging spectrum to craft a story however you like. I've seen some really dark gumiho centric stories, that involve torturing men and eating their livers, bringing about the destruction of the human race, taking over the world, etc. This particular show sits on the other end of the spectrum, and it's basically just a fluffy romantic comedy.I don't really have any problems with this show, it's just that it's pretty forgettable; it breezes right in and breezes right away just as quickly. Shin Min a is your lead actress (the Gumiho). I've always had a thing for her, but that pretty much goes the same for any talented and pretty Korean actress. She's solid enough here. The lead actor is played by Lee Seung gi, who is a young solo singing artist that I don't recall seeing in any acting role before this. He doesn't yet have the star power of Min a, but he did just fine in his role as well. He plays a struggling young action actor who's trying to break into the big time. EDIT   : Seung gi is quite well known now compared to when I originally wrote this review years ago. The story (which I will try to recall from memory) begins with Min a trying to be married off in the Joseon era. Rumors are swirling that she might be a Gumiho though, so she has no takers; everyone fears it will bring doom and destruction upon their village, and as a man, I'd rather slowly destroy my liver the old fashioned way, instead of having it ripped out of my torso and watch it being eaten as I die a painful death. Heartbroken that nobody wants her, Min a realizes she has no place in society and is subsequently banished into a temple painting mural to be stored for all eternity (this is another common Korean legend concerning how immortal and inhuman creatures, beasts, etc...can be dispatched of). I can't remember if she does this voluntarily out of sheer despair, or is captured by a Gumiho hunter.Flash forward to . Min a is getting pretty tired of living in this painting for the last several hundred years, so she tricks our young male lead who happens upon the temple into uttering the right phrase or doing the right thing that will release her. He does so, and from there it's mostly a straightforward mythical rom com (kind of along the lines of the American movie: Splash). There are lots of cute moments that follow where he discovers who what she really is, and where she learns about the modern world and follows him around so she can eat more of her favorite dish (i.e. cow). Her  tails pop out uncontrollably whenever she gets overly excited, and she's helps him out of numerous jams using her super human abilities. At one point, she even saves his life using her special powers.The  leads quickly begin to fall in love, but all is not perfect; other characters find out about, or begin to suspect something is a little off with, Min a, as she and Seung gi try to keep her true identity secret. There's also a modern day Gumiho hunter (who apparently does not understand how shirt buttons work) that's hot on her trail. Eventually, Min a decides she wants to become human and live her life as a normal person with her true love. She's given a magical elixir by the Gumiho hunter that may just fulfill her wishes; it's not without risks though, as she or her new love or both may perish if she takes it. Down the hatch it goes though and let's see what happens.From there, it's a matter of what will happen to the two leads as they wait to see if they'll survive her transformation into becoming a human. And, of course, whether he, she, or both survive is dependent upon how strong their love is for one another.Bottom Line: I don't think this show belongs in the   star range the current IMDb reviews and ratings suggest (again, just my opinion). I've seen a lot of Korean melodramas over the years, so I feel I have a pretty good prospective on this genre. That being said (written), this show is quite enjoyable overall, and I have no problem recommending it. I also think it's a good recent starter show if you're not yet familiar with KTV dramas, as it's not as overly taxing as many other KTV melodramas can often be. It's a light and short comedic romance series that's pretty effective at what it's trying to accomplish, and what's not to like about that?I think  stars is just about right, so that's what I'm giving it!"}, "10": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "740": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "917": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "712": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "851": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1017": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "971": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "Disappointing spin off of the ground breaking IRIS.

This show basically ramps up the same action and intrigue found in Iris, but, it does so at the expense of providing the central dramatic themes that made Iris the more interesting and addictive of the  shows.SPOILERS AHEAD!I did not like this show as near as much as its predecessor, but I did still enjoy watching it. It only very loosely follows the events that occurred in the Iris series, and you don't really need to watch that show first in order to watch this one. Although, there are a couple of crossover characters involved that might make you scratch your head for a couple of episodes as to who they are if you did not watch Iris first. These Iris characters just got in the way here for the most part, and they did not need to be incorporated (somewhat clumsily, I might add) into this show.Frankly, this show would have been better off it if had distanced itself from being an Iris spin off in my opinion. It's not a bad stand alone action show on its own, that would have likely been much better thought of without all the inherent direct comparisons to some other show.This show gets off to a blazing start action wise, and it doesn't waste any time letting you know what you're in for. In the intro,  teams of secret agents are pitted against each other as they battle over a nuclear scientist who defected. Once that's wrapped up, they flash forward a bit, where various new crises are implemented by the baddies over time, while the good guys try to stop them. That's basically it!As with Iris, there are a number of organizations and persons involved that are good, bad, gray, or undecided. They add a few more organizational & personal angles in this show though (which were mostly redundant); this is not confusing per se, but it only serves to unnecessarily try to complicate the plot with very little benefit to the overall story. This show is by no means bad, particularly so if you're looking for an action series. There are a number of action scenes (several of which are quite impressive), and, the acting, production values, etc, are all above average. However, it lacks an underlying story with enough purpose to bring the entire production together to deem it a must watch show.; it ultimately just follows a continuing pattern of: intrigue plot scene, action set piece scene, romance plot scene, then repeat.It's decent enough to recommend as it does more than enough quite well. The first  episodes or so were, indeed, highly entertaining. This show gets bogged down quite a bit once the primary plot kicks in though. There's plenty enough talent and money involved to make it all work, and there are only a very few episodes that are poorly written, directed, or produced. I think where it fails a bit is a result of what seems to have been rush to capitalize on Iris. This show would have been much better served if the writers and story tellers were given some more time to think things through in advance, but that's the way it goes sometimes!Bottom Line: Somewhere in the   star range.

This series is handled with a certain delicacy; a restraint that doesn't prevent or hold back, but depicts the tender beauty of two people in love. I submit that a viewer may find it very difficult to pass judgment, for how does one justify judging love? Can love be judged?To the naive viewer, Sunjae Lee is a young man, barely , who thinks and feels with his hormones. This is a gross misinterpretation and understanding of who he is. Sunjae Lee is a simple young man who knows how to do things in only one way: with love and passion. A gifted pianist, Sunjae is able to captivate his audiences, whether they be a concert hall or a few listeners, not with just the beauty of his play, but with the heart and passion he puts into it. Several viewers are so captivated by his play, that he moves them to tears. It is a bit ironic that a young man of  already knows the secret to love and living simply.Oh Hyewon is a middle aged woman, approximately twenty years older than Sunjae. A renowned pianist when she was Sunjae's age, she has now found herself pulled into the world of wealth and power. She works for a Seohan Art Institute as an executive accountant. She loves the life that her money buys for her, and she has long forgotten the passion and her own love for music. She is married to a university professor, who also works for the institute. They share a house and a life that is more like those of roommates than of spouses. There is little tenderness or warmth in their relationship or in their house, which looks like a cold bastille atop the street. It is somewhat ironic that the only room in the house that has any warmth at all, is the music room.Sunjae's talent is soon discovered, and he's asked to come over to the professor's house to play. Hyewon is asked to listen, given her musical background. Immediately, she is taken back to a time when she used to share the same love and passion for music that Sunjae has. Hyewon can't help but be enamored by the young man, unable to realize that she has already captivated him.There is a certain degree of irony in their relationship, in which Hyewon attempts to teach Sunjae about her world; the world of power and treachery. It is a world that is completely foreign to Sunjae, and he already realizes that he wants no part of it. He is not interested in money or acquiring things. And yet, it is his simple and complete way of loving, that makes him Hyewon's teacher in that regard. The acting performances are all first rate, especially those of Ah in Yoo (Sunjae) and Hui ai Kim (Hyewon). The relationship between these two characters is handled deftly, like a piano piece...full of love, beauty, and grace. Viewers may find themselves longing for their own Sunjae...someone who can love so unequivocally and unconditionally as Sunjae can. His love is all the more profound in the little things that he does to ensure her comfort. One cannot mention this series without the incredible musical performances. Nearly every episode has a piano piece that seems to perfectly coincide with the feelings of Sunjae and Hyewon. Watching this series is like listening to a long concert, and by the end, you feel all the better for it!"}, "958": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Fassbinder's Berlin Alexanderplatz () was a long movie   over  hours long. The Thornbirds, Roots and other early TV mini series were long movies broken into consecutive episodes. I love a mini series as a melodrama that tells a story in the long movie format, as opposed to those that tell different stories in the same setting (like Grey's Anatomy, Mad Men and to a lesser extent Damages, Breaking Bad, and Revenge that change the story at times while keeping to a general story). In this regard, I have discovered some gems in the South Korean TV mini series of recent years.The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back. This me recur in the same story. Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved. If personality dynamics are properly depicted in a valid manner, and if the production is skillful, powerful emotions can be evoked in the viewer. In this way we can live many lifetimes through movies, in our one lifetime   greatly enriching our incarnate experience.These South Korean productions (seen on Netflix streaming) are first class with excellent production and direction, some terrific casting and acting (particularly from some of the females who give some matchless world class performances), brilliant musical accompaniment, and staging. What makes these so good is the way they skillfully evoke deep emotion in the viewer. South Korean movie making is superb   world class.However, the following caveats must be considered by the USA viewer. They are subtitled and some people hate this. The South Korean cultural norms, values and sanctions may sometimes seems silly or old fashioned to the USA viewer. The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation unity   sometimes reminiscence of a old Frank Capra film.Most importantly, in order for the sometimes complicated sub plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing, and this leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people, that sometimes seem to be unlikely by USA cultural standards. The viewer may wonder at times why good but trusting people are so easily manipulated and deceived by bad and selfish people, but con artists do often succeed (just look at politicians for example). However this poetic license of improbability is needed to develop the story   just accept it as occurring even though unlikely at times. Taking these factors into account Will help you become involved and emotionally engrossed. It was hard t for me to quit watching at times so I binged watched.I would rank these as follows but tastes differ and your rankings might not agree:     (hard to say which is best)Shining InheritanceWhen a Man LovesThat Winter, The Wind BlowsSecret Garden. Five Fingers. The Scent of a Woman. The Great Queen Seondeok. A Hundred Years Inheritance. Lie To me. Roof Top Prince. Dr. Jin. The Great DoctorShining inheritance is about family, love, greed, deceit, manipulation, altruism, and other dynamics important in the pursuit of happiness. It is nicely paced over  episodes, in fully developing the story, but the viewer must stick with it at least halfway to get the full emotional impact of the story. Perhaps more coherent than other of the above mini series, it could be your favorite."}, "1330": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "452": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1398": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "155": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1340": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "602": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "570": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "This had the markings of great Korean filmmaking.

His conservative party is all about maintaining the status quo for the ruling body and the nation's elite, and her tiny liberal party is all about reform and the betterment of the lives of the average citizen. Both representatives have fiery personalities and disagree on most everything from the start, but they soon begin to understand each other a little better and begrudgingly find some mutual common ground over time.

It does come with some typical melodrama of course, but I'm warning you right now that there's ultimately very little of that stuff here in comparison to most other K dramas.

As usual, the  secondary leads don't stand a chance to get the guy girl they want, and they basically serve as impediments to the central love story; these characters push the limits of being too antagonistic at times, but hold back just enough so they aren't totally unsympathetic...Park Hee Soon and Han Chae Ah fill these roles effectively enough as Min Jung's character's former step brother, and the spunky reporter girl, respectively.There's a bunch of supporting characters as well, and they all serve their purpose satisfactorily enough. Several veterans and a couple of younger actors are on hand to fill out the roles of various aides and party members; most of these parts are devoted to dispensing advice and or providing a good bit of side humor along the way, and most of this was done well enough...the semi incompetent ruling party spokesman (i.e. porn man) is particularly useful as the never ending butt of jokes throughout this show, and, many of these side characters (at least under a certain age) have their own little romantic relationships to deal with. There's only one child on the scene, and she's mostly hilarious in a limited role as the astute and acerbic niece of Min Jung's character.The behind the camera crew holds up their end quite well. The show is sharply written and well directed, and there's some effective use of post edit screen captions & effects along the way. The soundtrack is pretty solid too, and it evolves nicely over time to suit the nature of the unfolding story. In addition, the transition of the  acts is done rather seamlessly without wildly changing the overall feel of the show (which is a frequent problem with some of these shows).Basically, this show gets all the little things right for the most part, which brings us around to the performance of the two leads, and they are both fantastic. This is a real nice pairing of two stars that have excellent chemistry together, and neither of them disappoint. Shin Ha Kyun is a terrific actor who's starred in a number of big screen productions over the years (several of which are some of my all time favorite Korean films); he hasn't been in many TV dramas to my knowledge until just recently, but he obviously has no problem making the transition to this type of production. For her part, Lee Min Jung is outstanding in her role; she brings a nice mix to the table of everything you could possibly want in your female rom com lead. There are lots of talented and attractive Korean actresses working in this genre, but it's hard to imagine any of them doing a better job with this material than she did.This show is quite good for what it is, and the demographic it's aimed at. There's hardly anything to even grumble about. My only real complaint is the eventual incorporation of a hidden bloodline & secret family back story (which seemed a bit forced and unnecessary). For the life of me, I have no idea why Korean TV seemingly can't make a single show without invoking some type of melodramatic trope like this somewhere along the line; this show was perfectly fine as just a straightforward romantic comedy, and it would have been better served if it just stayed that way from start to finish. There is plenty of opportunity to include that type of melodramatic story line in any number of other shows.This is not the type of show that's likely going to pull in big Korean TV ratings numbers, because it really just doesn't fit the mold for a KTV melodrama that most fans & viewers of this genre are looking for. That being said (written), this show is very witty, and it's often both charming and amusing. Personally, it's one of my favorite K dramas from !Bottom Line; If you're looking for a mostly lighthearted Korean TV rom com series for adults, this show is Totally Recommended! out of  stars!"}, "1150": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "774": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "954": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1341": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "462": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "The Virtual Bride (aka The Eccentric Daughter in Law) is a  episode KTV drama from the summer of .SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: A struggling young idol agrees to star in a variety show in order to gain popularity for her and the girl idol group she's a member of. This fake variety show involves her going to live and work with the mother of the guy she's pretend dating, along with said guy, and their extended family.This shows stars Kim Dasom (I don't know what her actress name or real life name is, but she's a member of the idol group Sistar). I am familiar with Sistar and who Dasom is, but this my first exposure to her as an actress. She has participated in two other TV dramas prior to this, but they were both well over  episodes, and I have neither the time nor inclination to watch shows of that length. The first thing you should know about Dasom is that she is SMOKING hot (just like all of her Sistar idol mates). The entire group is built (ahem) to be as sexy as possible, while still trying to exhibit a cute and fun appeal at the same time; go watch some of their music videos and you'll see what I'm referring to. Can Dasom act though?, and, is this show worthwhile?...well, let's find out!As our story begins, Dasom's character (Oh In Young) makes her way to the variety show set (which takes place in a farm home setting which prepares various traditional Korean food & sauces for restaurants & other buyers). This is a place that requires you to work hard and get your hands dirty. In Young, however, loves her high heels and skimpy flashy outfits and she's ill suited for this environment at first. As such, the family she's moved in with disapproves of her right away, but they've agreed to do the show, and if it's well received, their business will prosper (and so will In Young and her idol group & company). Over time, the show becomes popular as In Young fits in a little better, and starts slowly winning over the entire family and their ever discerning family matriarch. And of course, she and her nerdy but handsome fake show love interest costar begin to have actual feelings for each other.You'll immediately notice this show has a pretty low budget. That's OK, but you must compensate for fiscal restraints by having some combination of a good story, solid writing, proper direction, and stellar acting performances. Unfortunately, this show doesn't really do any one of those things very well. You know you're in for some pain and suffering when the first couple of episodes consist mainly of a midriff baring lead having multiple gassy fart problems, followed by the introduction of several stereotypical self centered & annoying Korean cinema mothers, followed by a bunch of mama boys that need to grow up, followed by younger female characters who are searching for self empowerment. YUK!The second thing you'll notice about this show is that it resembles a long running day time Korean soap opera that's been compressed to  episodes and played on fast forward. Almost every scene consists of a one or two minute interaction between one or more cast members, then it's on to the next one or two minute scene. The way it's scripted and framed doesn't help matters either; it consists mainly of a close up shot of Character A reading a single line, then a close up of Character B reading a single line, then repeat some back and forth like this until the end of their short scene. At the end of each scene, someone references or mentions something about a rd party not involved in the current scene. Then, cut away to said rd party having their own short scene, then continue this formula FOREVER until the show eventually concludes.Because of how the scenes are written, there never seems to be any personal interaction or meaningful communication among any of the character. It feels like everyone is just reading lines and nothing more. All of the characters involved are supposed to evolve over time, but it's a very cumbersome & repetitive process along the way; someone accepts someone, then turns their back on them, then accepts them again; this pattern of behavior is repeated often throughout this show between multiple characters, and, it really becomes tedious and just plain absurd as the show drags on. As a result, this show is severely lacking in any depth, and it fails to ever build any suspense, tension, or momentum.The cast does what they're asked, and they mostly do OK (but just barely). There are several insufferable performances though, and no standout ones. The cast's star power and  or acting prowess (or lack thereof) isn't the problem here though; where this show fails clearly lies at the feet of the writers and the director. Good K dramas build towards their climax and include multiple important scenes where you can't take your eyes off the screen, which in turn, engages the viewer to invest in the story, care about its characters, and look forward to the next episode. Sadly, this show doesn't ever accomplish any of this. As far as Dasom's performance goes, she did all right with what she was given to work with. I doubt she'll ever win any best actress awards, but she could likely make a decent living in this field if given the chance to be aligned with shows that have better stories and some decent writing and direction. Until that happens though, she shouldn't quit her day job with Sistar (which she is excellent at)!Summary: Unfortunately, I have to drop the hammer on this show; it's neither interesting nor intelligent nor original. This is clearly a project that was just designed to quickly fill a time slot and nothing more. In short, it has no heart and no soul. Don't waste your time with this.Bottom Line:  out of  stars!...Not recommended!"}, "519": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "If this movie teaches you nothing else, you will walk away saying there are some shady females out there.

Great addition in the series.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "After  movies the series is still going strong! You can't say this about an awful lot of series, especially not ones within the horror genre. In that regard the series deserves lots of credit but at the same time it also isn't exactly a movie series that stands out with great movies in it. All of them are quite average but certainly original and watchable enough to check out. Also as standalone movies, fore the series its movies aren't really connected to each other story  or character wise.It perhaps isn't fair to call this movie an horror, since it actually focuses far more on the mystery and dramatic elements of the story. This has basically been the case with every movie out of its series but yet they keep on advertising it as Asian horror because that simply is the popular thing to do. It would also be hard to advertise it in any other way really and find the right target audience for this movie. It's a hard sell because all of these movies are basically such unique and original ones within its genre. That's why I always keep enjoying these movies and wouldn't mind seeing more of them being made in the near future. As of yet this remains the last one out of the series but there is no reason to stop here really. There is still plenty of ground to explore and new, different, approaches to take on its concept.But having said this; I don't regard Yeo go goi dam    Dong ban ja sal as an all too solid movie. Out of all the movies this one has probably the most simple script, even though toward the end the movie becomes overly complicated again. It might be because the movie is 'borrowing' too much from its previous movies. The characters are all the same again, even though its a fresh new story with new characters and actors in it and also the way the movie progresses is quite predictable, especially when you've already seen some of the previous movies out of the series. The movie reminded me a bit too much of the first and the third movie; Yeogo goedam and Yeogo goedam : Yeowoo gyedan, which does perhaps makes this a bit of a redundant entry within its series, that doesn't add enough new things.The movie is still good though. It has a pleasant buildup, which is slow but steadily and with every minute starts to show more and more of what is going exactly. In that regard this movie works far better as a mystery than an horror really, even though the movie still has plenty of scares and also bloody moments in it.Thing that didn't worked as well were its actors. Out of all the movies within its series this one probably featured the worst actors in it. Or perhaps it was the directing, since every movie out of the series had featured young, inexperienced actors in it, of which some had never acted before and also never again.It's still a steady movie, that also helps to keep the series a steady one. http:  bobafett.blogspot.com "}, "960": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "Maybe I should have given it an .\nBut I'll stick with .\nIt has a serial killer in it, but it's not about a serial killer.

The very high level of self parody done well that is lauded to the hilt in western efforts like the TV series Chuck is derided unappreciatively as shallow simpering, career trademark of Jim Carrey. Most of all, the production quality, in particular the substantially superior picture resolution & camera work, gets no mention. Again & again, I've been left agape at the beauty of just the picture or scene setting or camera staging in Chinese & Korean production that is so evidently a quantum level above even the best of what I see come out of Hollywood. Much of that seems to utilize the : aspect ratio with a panoramic sensibility missing altogether in western cinema weaned on the : TV screen so cripplingly dependent on the close up of faces. Although I have only watched the first episode so far, I hesitate to binge watch this excellent series because just the one episode was so full of skilled nuance both visually & dramatically. K drama is often derided as overly melodramatic, and I suspect the many lesser productions I never saw that constitute by far the bulk of the genre are such.

She works hard and dreams of becoming a top chef one day, but her life is soon turned upside down when an abrasive new head chef takes over the restaurant she works at and promptly makes everyone's lives miserable. The new chef (Hyun Wook) is a skilled yet demanding boss, and he's also a smug misogynistic prick who belittles everyone he comes across. Inexplicably, Yoo Kyung and Hyun Wook start to develop feelings for each other and soon begin a cautious relationship.From there, it's standard K Drama fare that employs the mismatched budding romantic leads plot, along with two alternative love interests with their own back stories, and a host of side characters along the way. Just follow along with everyone's personal & professional lives to see where it all goes. It's the same pattern as always, only this show takes place in a kitchen restaurant environment (instead of a hotel, hospital, etc.). PROSIt's Predictability: There is something to be said for how comfortably familiar these shows often are. It's like wearing your favorite old jeans or sweatshirt, or, perhaps a better analogy would be eating your favorite comfort food; If you're a regular viewer of these types of shows, you know exactly how this particular show is going to feel & taste right from the get go.Lead Actress: Gong Hyo Jin plays Yoo Kyung; she's become one of the go to actresses for these types of shows in recent years, and she's really good in general at playing the girl just trying to get by in life who stumbles into a romance. However, this is not one of my favorite roles for her.The Food: DO NOT watch this show on an empty stomach!...There aren't many shows that consistently presents food on screen so exquisitely as this one does; we're talking hard core food porn here as this show often focuses on the kitchen chefs creating and producing one fantastic looking dish after another. It's mostly Italian cuisine, with some Korean flair mixed in, along with lobster, filet mignon, fine dining meals, entrees, various presentations, and so forth. And, of course, lots and lots of pasta. Everything looks absolutely delicious!Soundtrack: Nobody does TV show soundtracks & musical scores like KTV does, and I think this is one of the most regularly undervalued aspects of all of these shows. As usual, there are a half dozen recurring melodies or so that are utilized to suit the varying moods as needed throughout this show, plus (if I remember correctly) a couple of a KPop stars on hand to sing a duet or two as per norm. This is not my favorite OST by any means, but I don't know how many times I've watched these shows and thought that's a catchy & appropriate tune, that's a nice song, etc.Pacing: This show does keep everything moving along. There is some repetitiveness to it, but very little of the endless pauses and longing stares of people reminiscing about stuff that just happened. I have very little tolerance for that nonsense in my K Dramas.Ending: It's (SPOILERS) no surprise that everybody lives happily ever after in some fashion or another by the time it all wraps up. CONSIt's Predictability: Yes, this is listed as one of the Pros, but this cuts both ways. If you're hoping for anything out of the ordinary or unexpected to happen here, you can forget it. There is little doubt what will eventually happen to all the players involved by the middle of episode . It wouldn't hurt for a few more of these shows to try to be a little more diverse every now and then.Endless Over Acting: The main characters don't have to endure this too much, but almost all of the auxiliary characters are forced to over act to the point of buffoonery at times. Sometimes this is cute & effective, but it's simply annoying and obnoxious way more often than not.Lead Actor's character: This is by far the biggest problem with this show! The lead male chef character is played by Lee Sun Gyun. He represents the stern teacher figure type that supposed to grow and soften over time as the main love interest, but his evolution is so poorly executed that he rarely ever becomes even an acceptable person (much less a love interest character to root for). What woman in their right mind would want to be with this guy?...He's arrogant, stubborn, childish, condescending, verbally abusive, and offers little in the way of being a desirable mate. And, the stupid smirk he's always wearing on his face doesn't help matters any. By extension, the mere fact that Yoo Kyung actually likes this guy reflects very poorly on her character.Summary: It has its moments, and is by no means terrible, but the Cons often outweigh the Pros IMO. And, it's severely hampered by its choice to write the male lead character as they did; this guy is just way too much of a jerk for the viewer to identify with why the female lead character would ever like him in the first place. If this were real life, these  people would clearly be headed for a depressing relationship, or divorce, or worse, if they decided to be together long term. It would be one thing if this show were aiming for that type of future dismal outlook, but it's not; this is all somehow supposed to be romantic, and you're supposed to be persuaded that the male lead is just perfect for our female lead, and that everything will work out great between them in the end. I, however, think this show fails miserably at trying to accomplish that.Bottom Line:  out of  stars!"}, "305": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "844": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "866": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "860": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "693": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "51": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "This is first time i see korean drama...\nStory, plot, detail, soundtrack, its so amazing!!\n&Maybe, just this my korean drama...\nBest romance film in my life...Uh, I dont know...\nThis film, make me feel falling in love again...", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Just like my headline shows, the acting of the both lead actors......the whole cast is flawless in this drama.

One set of characters (no spoilers here) are a squad of police detectives who are somewhat inept, but in the first episode, that is a bit overdone, coming off a bit too much like slapstick comedy, gone very, very wrong. It just seemed a bit too childish. But, based upon the IMDB reviews, and score, I went ahead and watched the next episode, which led to me quickly being addicted (and the Episode  silliness did not recur). There are just a continuous set of hooks (revelations) that keep you wondering what is going to happen next, and those are all part of a larger story that is woven together, revelation by revelation.Although there are a handful of core characters, this is one of those stories where you have to pay close attention, as the underlying story is a much larger canvas than is obvious up front, and as more details are revealed, and events from different timeframes are woven into the story, there are a lot of things to keep track of (both people and events). Certainly, it works better, IMHO, to be able to watch the series in a shorter timeframe (e.g. binge watching it in chunks), just because it has so much going on.It is the fact that most of the ongoing revelations are not so much adding pieces to the puzzle, as they are turning the puzzle on its head, that makes it so interesting. Those regular twists are also not unrealistic, i.e. (IMHO) they aren't just ridiculous, unlikely plot devices. There are often flashbacks that show events as they happen, to further weave those ever growing plot elements into the larger story. Again, some of those flashbacks involve the same characters, at different ages, so you need to pay attention in order to tie everything together. (Much as with another really great series, Dark, you can't be sitting on the couch, texting on your phone, while you attempt to watch this, or you will quickly find yourself lost.)Anyway, I'm obviously providing no real details about the story, to avoid any spoilers, but suffice it to say that I believe that anyone how watches the first few episodes, will either find themselves as hooked as I was, OR, they will simply decide that it's not a story that interests them at all.

Yes there are lots of characters and it takes a while to sort it out, but the selfish power hungry politicians play chess with all the characters you love (and hate). ) Great villains   Hwang Chul Woong (Lee Jong Hyuk) driven to hard core assassin by chess master Minister Lee (Kim Eung Soo). ) Cutest kid ever, Crown Prince Seok Kyeon (Kim Jin Woo). ) Eop Bok's final stand was very satisfying. What I did not love: ) Mid way the series took a dark turn that was recoverable, but the shock was significant. ) Tough to keep the political story characters straight and politicians are never nice people. ) Who lives and who dies? Even though I'd might have made some changes, the retribution and redemption choices the writers made, rang true for the characters. ) More of an epilog on the final episode to wrap the series up with a bow, much is left to your imagination."}, "655": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1261": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "Ook me yrs to watch but wow what a movie\nLaughs and tears.

Although mentally unfit, the emotion and love of the father is undeniable. And then you have a smart and understanding daughter, who loves his father so much and doesn't see her father differently. Behind that, there is a tragically engaging story    The kind hearted father, as innocent as he is, accused of murder and rape. The prison scenes act as an icing to the story. A place so feared and somber, is in fact where most of the comedy takes place. It shows the positive side of a prison life, and that not all prisoners are gangsters or bad. Everyone has a heart, a good one that is. They have made their prison cell a very bearable place. So much that even Ye Seung, the daughter can hide in it and stay with them.All characters play very important roles to construct the whole movie. It's fun to watch the prison inmates, all having their very own personality. Ryoo Seung Yong portrayed the character of the mentally handicapped father very convincingly. And the child actor, Kal So Won is so cute and sweet and suited her role so much. Even the adult version of the girl turns out to be a real sweetheart and has a very captivating performance. The movie shows us that you can be someone as high up as a Police Commissioner, but a disgusting personality. Or someone as simple minded as the father in this story, but with a good heart. Rankings and positions really does not determine a person. Sometimes things are more delightful when it's not complicated, as long as we know to appreciate and cherish all that we have.This is definitely one of the best Korean movies. Filled with tears and laughters. Yes, you have to prepare some tissues as it gets very teary  eyed towards the end.. and not just once.

Look no further than where the disease started (the king is patient ) and the way that the society tries to deal with their dead; seperating the bodies of the rich from those of the poor, giving proper burial to the rich whereas burning the poor. Instead of dealing with the actual situation they choose to focus on formalities even when those can endanger the living. Not only that but the Confucian principles of not harming the body(burning,cutting etc) are only to be applied to the rich. The society is so much plagued with an archaic system of principles and conduct that they fail to see it for what it actually is, the disease itself, in that sense not only the zombies are infected but everyone.Btw no guns and slow zombies in this one like the Walking Dead. Here zombies RUN, no time to waste and the living ones have to use whatever tools they find, mainly tools used in agriculture and farming!In terms of visual aestetics the series looks stunning!

They consist of two men and two women who I guess are all Gumiho (or whatever their male counterparts are, since I've always known them to be female). Gumihos are nine tailed foxes who live a really long time, have powerful abilities and skills, and can take on human form. In this story, they once lived in harmony with humans in the distance past but were betrayed and soon driven to near extinction. They still live in small numbers in the present however, and many of them have a thirst for human livers in order to survive.Our good Gumihos, need to hunt down the bad Gumihos to keep the humans safe, and they need to this without the humans finding out about them. The four of them have varying skills and use different weapons to do their job (various swords and bladed arms and the like). They are also, naturally, all young and incredibly good looking, and each of them love one of the others in typical Korean melodrama fashion. The lone exception to all of these love angles between themselves, is one girl who gets involved with a human police officer. This cop gets assigned to a secret task force that's aware of the Gumiho's existence, and are trying to destroy them.There's too many story lines involved in this series. In addition to the cops, the good & bad Gumihos, the numerous love stories, and more, the main female charachter also happens to be a special kind of Gumiho that only comes along every  years.

Featuring structures of the traditional 'bildungsroman', snapshots into the grueling lives of salary men and office politics, the show intertwines these concepts with humour, emotion, reflectiveness, wisdom, finely executed through a fitting soundtrack, impeccable cinematography and directing and outstanding acting. A solid show thematically, it handles with great sensitivity and deftness the many delicately captured aspects of human nature and society. The characters and their development throughout the story are extremely well written and by far one of the most impressive aspects of the show, fleshed out by the complexity and subtle nuance of the relationships depicted. Entirely believable in both their strengths and vulnerabilities, the show allows an audience to connect with the characters on a very fundamental level. You will find something of yourself, or someone that you know reflected in the characters of the show, the persistent underdog in Gurae who struggles against all odds, the talented but down to earth Young Yi whose exceptional ability as a woman incurs the resentment of her colleagues, the at first seemingly stoic Oh Sang Sik who over the course of the show reveals his deep capacity for empathy and self sacrifice. Even the 'villains' are never clich\u00e9, one dimensional cardboard cutouts to fill a gap in the story, but all serve towards Misaeng's intimate and moving exploration of the human condition. Misaeng shows many aspects of mundane life, but never itself, becomes mundane, taking the viewer on a at times beautifully poignant, vividly evocative and greatly inspiring journey from start to finish. As I believe this is a show that leaves a viewer of any demographic something to take away, I'd urge anyone reading this to give it a try.

Most intriguing of all is the Korean card game that frames the action   a game that attracts die hard gamblers and a small group of cheats who live off the system. As such, this often feels like THE STING, but with a more brutal core. The narrative is set out in a series of lessons any prospective gambler must learn; with each lesson, the risks become increasingly challenging. The narrative almost manages to support a love story, though there's no room in a gambler's heart for true love. The energy of the narrative is matched by the plot's daunting complexity, but the film journeys into surprising areas.

's I am Happy didn't make me happy. I wasn't really glad with how the South Korean film turn out. Loosely inspired by author Lee Cheong Jonn's short novel 'Mr. Cho, Man deuk'; which tells the story of two people living life at a Korean psychiatric ward. This movie directed & written by Yoon Jong Chan slightly change the novel's story plot to something else; which in return, cause this film to end up, more like a mess than a masterpiece. The movie tells the story of two people; Cho Man su (Hyun Bin) a patient suffering from a mental illness & his nurse, Soo kyung (Lee Bo young). Both are painfully going through some issues, due to the fact, that other people dependent on them. In Cho Man Su's case, he was deeply mistreat by his mother suffering from dementia and his brother addicted to gambling to the point, that he turned crazy. For Soo Kyung, the stress of her work, added to the pressure of taking care of her serious ill, father is causing her to go into a deep depression. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I really didn't like how this movie was market in the United States, as romantic comedy when it clearly not. There is barely any sign of romance in the film at all, between the two main characters. I don't think the main guy even develops a crush on the girl at all. The same with the woman. I never saw the relationship being more than Nurse Patient relationship. So, it was odd to see it, market as more than that. If you're looking for Hyun Bin to be the handsome leading man in a romantic comedy like his 's TV show 'My Lovely Sam Soon' or 's 'The Secret Garden', then you will be sorely disappointed by 'I am Happy'. There isn't even any really funny moments for him to shine in. In truth, there isn't anything, but heartbreaking moments. It was very misleading. That's false advertising, big time! I don't know, why they had to lie, to make audiences want to see it. The movie was still somewhat compelling to watch, with its psychological melodrama. If, there is anything good, about it, the acting wasn't that bad. Yes, the movie has a lot more slow and dull moments, where the actors does nothing, but stare like mindless zombies, but at least, there are some instants, where each of their character can really stand out and shine. Sadly, those intense emotional moments are far too little. Most of the movie is endless amount of talking scenes; which had dialogue that was mostly boring. The pacing for this film is also horrible. It really talks forever to tell, the story of these two. Hardly any action going on. Added to the pressure, is weird way, the film intercuts flashbacks. It's so confusing; one minute, Cho Man Su in the hospital, the next minute, he's running a car repair shop, another second, he's getting out of the hospital. The movie is full of odd place scenes like that. There is no sense of story structure. The movie is also missing a lot of exposition scenes as well. I can see the extent to which a brother with a gambling addiction and mother with dementia could send him over the edge, however, honestly, I still don't know, how Cho Man Su came under the delusion that he was a Swiss Millionaire. It seem like he had no idea, where Switzerland, was before this, nor did he shown any interest in being a millionaire, before then. So where did he get the idea? I also don't get, how his story, relations to the nurse's story. Yes, both people are dealing with illness, but dealing with mental illness is way difference than physical illness. There is hardly any connection with the two story concept. The movie even lose focus at times. One scene, has Man Su trying to stand up against shock therapy as if he is Randle McMurphy from 's One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. This over sense of rebellion, seem a little too out of character for him, even as a crazy guy. It really comes out of nowhere. Also, the sense that he's happy with his craziness is not really established, well. I didn't sense that he was happy with all the blank staring at walls. So I don't get it.

Korean TV drama.  Episodes. Summer of .SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: Teenagers go through their final school years on the way to young adulthood. As adults, they reconvene in  for their  year class reunion; while there, they all reflect on their past while their history together unfolds via back story. It's primarily a life story drama about growing up.A half dozen high school kids or so are focused on throughout this show (some more than others), along with one young teacher, and one set of parents. The vast majority of the story is told from  to  and takes place against the backdrop of the birth of K Pop. The kids meet at high school, become friends, experience awkward first loves, graduate, drift apart, move on in life, etc...The remainder of the story flashes forward in time periodically until it arrives at the present, where you eventually get to see what happened to everybody involved.KTV shows come & go at such a rapid fire pace that it's virtually impossible for a viewer to figure out what's actually going to be good and what's not until a show is well into its compressed run time. Fortunately, it's fairly easy to determine if a show will be suitable to your own personal tastes right away, and I must say I quickly developed a fondness for this particular one. Reply  doesn't have an overly famous cast, a huge budget, or a massive pre air marketing campaign to prop it up, so it has to work a little a harder to prove itself, and figure out how to find an audience along the way. It basically has to rely on smart storytelling, and subsequent word of mouth, in order to be successful, and it did all of this, and then some, really well.Clearly, the best thing this show has going for it is its creativity and intelligence. It's quite well written, and the way it implements a multiple time line is highly effective; subtle hints are dropped at the current day dinner party during each episode, then it flashes back to the past to see how things came to be in the present. This method of storytelling serves to successfully further the plot while keeping you interested in the story & characters along the way. This show also refuses to pander to viewers; it's completely devoid of one note characters and typical antagonists, and it does not rely on being overly formulaic (which is a frequent problem that is inherent to this industry). Its willingness to openly deal with oft addressed topics in a thoughtful, and often hilarious, manner is rather impressive as well.The late 's early K Pop theme is frequently focused on throughout this show, despite the fact that it's somewhat irrelevant to the true heart of the story. This is all implemented exceptionally well however, and while this show could have succeeded without it, it is certainly better off for including it. There's a good deal of nostalgia involved as a result (from an array of props, to the soundtrack of that era, to cameos, period references, and so on), and, everything is nicely woven together into one seamless tale; none of it ever feels out of place, or tacked on, just for the sake of making it part of the overall story. The cast is pretty solid at getting their jobs done, and they're all afforded well rounded roles. While not unrecognizable to most fans of the Korean entertainment industry, this is primarily a very youthful cast without years & years of experience in this field. Several of them are current K Pop industry crossover stars as well, and the irony of having several actual K Pop idols portraying high school kids obsessed with K Pop is not lost on me. The lead role is reserved for Jung Eun ji (of APink fame); she could use a little more seasoning going forward as a drama star, but she is way ahead of the curve already and makes for an oddly charismatic and impressive young actress for someone who's relatively new at this. Everybody gave nice performances throughout, and they were equally believable as both high school kids and their future  year old counterparts. The two parents are even given diverse parts as well (which is rare for these shows); there are usually only a handful of the same tired old roles available to K drama parents elders (i.e. usually you're either: a rich manipulative ass, a drunken deadbeat dad, a poor sick mom, etc). Here, the parents are refreshingly portrayed as regular people going through their everyday lives as a normal middle aged middle class couple. In many ways, the parents practically exemplify what the entire spirit of this show is all about.Summary: All in all, this is a quickly paced and very effective series that I have virtually no complaints about whatsoever. It features a simple and approachable story that should resonate with a wide range of viewers; young old, Korean not Korean, male female, it doesn't really matter. Engaging, smart, funny, poignant; this is a perfect example of how good KTV dramas can be when they aspire to be more than just stylishly status quo.Bottom Line: A real gem for K drama fans that's not to be missed!  out of  stars!...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}, "611": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1116": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "37": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "97": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "More horribly than lovely, this show had a good start but got tangled up all the way till the end.

The mother is killed in front of Cha Yeon Jin and she is gunned down and left for dead.The secret government agency nurses Cha Yeon Jin back to health and recruits her as an assassin. She agrees as long as she is allowed to go after the man who killed her mother.Lots of nudity and violence and just enough differences to make it a interesting show.If you don't mind reading subtitles it's worth a viewing.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Little Girl K is a Korean TV series about a young female assassin that aired in . It goes by so many different names that it's hard to keep track of (it's aka Girl K, Killer K, Sonyeo K). It's worth checking out if you're into this sort of thing.SPOILERS AHEAD!This show is similarly themed to Le Femme Nikita, Leon the Professional, etc. So, you basically know what you're getting here (i.e. young discarded girl trains to become a killer). There's nothing really new or groundbreaking involved, but it is executed & paced quite well, and is packed with lots of typical South Korean cinematic goodness.The lead character (Yeon Jin) is played by Han Groo. She is more than capable enough throughout the show in accomplishing what's asked of her (which is quite a lot actually). She plays a cute & likable, albeit tough, high school girl who lives alone with her single mother. She can't seem to stay out of trouble though, and one day she gets tossed into a series of events that culminate in her & her friends being sought after by some very bad people. Eventually, she gets tracked down by the bad guys and as result, her mother and many of her friends are killed, and she is left for dead.She miraculously survives the onslaught however, and is taken in by an older female assassin who nurses her back to life and then trains her as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Yeon Jin looks to her newfound mentor as somewhat of a surrogate mother that can provide her both guidance and direction in life, and with her back ground in martial arts and desire to seek vengeance, Yeon Jin eagerly & quickly absorbs all the killing knowledge & training she can from this woman.After recovering from her near death experience, and receiving her combat assassin training, Yeon Jin sets out on the most difficult task imaginable; going back to high school as a new transfer student. I found this part of the show to be highly amusing; it's not meant to be funny per se, but the juxtaposition of the two opposite worlds she now inhabits and has to juggle is sufficiently entertaining. During the course of the school day, she reluctantly becomes more and more concerned with fitting in at school, making new girl friends, experiences angst over her feelings for a boy classmate that likes her, etc (i.e. typical high school girl stuff). And, at lunch, she's on the roof of a building with a high powered rifle trying to assassinate someone per her mentor's orders.Everything is moving along swimmingly to begin with, but Yeon Jin eventually discovers that her mentor is not quite who she appears to be and has ulterior motives that simply can't be abided. Even though Yeon Jin has long since become a cold hearted killer, she still knows right from wrong, and is soon pitted against her mentor and the evil organization she belongs to in a fight to death.This show is a little bit unusual in the way it continually tries to straddle the line from sometimes being a simple & cute high school girl drama, and then at the flick of a switch, suddenly devolves into a remorseless & seedy bloodbath. For what is essentially a made for TV Korean melodrama, this show is often INCREDIBLY VIOLENT; you'll find more violent stuff in various movies of course, but I can't recall any previously made Korean TV show that is as delightfully & frequently vicious as this show often is. The producers and director of this show obviously have no problem letting the blood flow here at will, and there's a fair amount of nudity as well if I recall correctly (but not from any of the lead characters). For a TV show that essentially revolves around the dramatic life of a high school girl, it's as down & dirty as can possibly be.Now, this show is only  episodes long, but I don't know why this is; I can't imagine this show was canceled in such a short time for lack of ratings, and the story seems to be purposely made to be completed at the end of the rd episode. Three episodes is very short and highly unusual for KTV, and I can't help but wonder why this wasn't just cut down to a  hour movie format, or wasn't fleshed out into a longer TV show. I'm not even sure if the short run time is actually a benefit or detriment to this show though; on the one hand, everything is tightly paced & compacted by the sheer nature of needing to get everything wrapped up within the  episodes. On the other hand, I enjoyed it quite a bit; so much so, that I would have most certainly watched some more episodes if there were any to be had. This show ultimately ended with a scene that left open the opportunity for some type of follow up show series, or what have you, but I've not heard of anything that might indicate as much as of the writing of this review.As is the case with any action drama TV show, Little Girl K can get a tad over the top and a slight bit corny at times, but it doesn't do so very often. And, with such a short run time, you can easily forgive & forget any such flaws you might find with it in contrast with the overall scheme of things.Bottom Line: I enjoyed this show, A LOT!...If you're looking for a quick fix to quench some blood thirst, and satisfy your need for Korean action melodrama, then this might be right up your alley.

Thought I have to balance the negative review before mine cos I really enjoyed this show ( which, by the way, is called The Undateables on VIKI ).\nFirst though, let's review the components of the K drama formula which you'll soon encounter once you become a regular : TWO GUYS pursuing ONE GIRL, though guy is never totally viable. LEAD MALE is rich & LEAD GIRL is not, with girl introducing guy to the simple pleasures he missed out on. FIRST MEETING OF MAIN COUPLE is angry awkward. LOTS OF ACCIDENTAL occasions early on for main duo to touch hug ( Aaargh ! VERY ANNOYING, by the way ! ). AT LEAST ONE PARENT of main duo is dead. AT LEAST  MAJOR CRISIS for main duo before inevitable happy ending. Yep, sounds like a recipe for boredom but it isn't if you care about the characters.\nSo, there are some exceptions, though this show sticks to most of the template. Formula aside, it's the other stuff that makes a good K Drama, like the story script, emotional connection & quality of the cast. Like a few other under rated K dramas, this one delivers in all areas.\nCentral couple are vital, obviously, & Hwang Jung Eum as the girl & Nam Goong Min as the guy have great chemistry in my opinion. She has some detractors on the VIKI forums which seriously baffles me. The support cast are also good, with Coach Yang a deserved fan fave.\nThe story ? The motley crew of the VIKI title ( as the main duo team up to get them dates ) are consistently entertaining, with the last third of the show being especially effective in that regard.

It's sad to see that some of you are too busy critiquing the lack of complexity in the plot, because it is this simplicity that makes this movie so beautiful. Since many of you have already reiterated the plot, i'll just cut the chase and try to clear up some confusion, hopefully.First of all, to understand why he let the girl go and turns against his boss, the flashback towards the end is very crucial. When she plays the cello, he smiles, and as he is dying, he smiles as he listens to her voice. These are the only two occasions in which he smiles throughout the entire movie. Whether this is love, attraction, or because he was thankful that she made him feel good, is open to interpretation. Given that he is an extremely straightforward and honest character(and also given that in this movie, everything is what you see on the screen  there are no hidden motives, twists, whatsoever), I assume that the reason he doesn't answer (or CAN'T answer) when asked why he did it by his boss is because he doesn't know himself. I think the key to understanding this movie is the title, and the narration at the end of the movie (something along the line of a disciple telling his master that he cries after a sweet dream because he knows it can't come true). For Sunwoo,the girl and his belief(?) that he can kill everyone else and still live are sweet dreams that cannot come true. The reason why he unrealistically gets by after getting shot and stabbed so much, is not simply because he is the main character, but because everything he does after meeting the girl is like a sweet 'dream', a surreal reality(yes, an oxymoron, just like the title  a 'bittersweet' life). The morbid ending is also very fitting  as sweet as the dream was, the more bitter it is when he wakes up from it and faces reality(once again relating to the last narration)."}, "1235": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "122": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "While I normally love K dramas, this one was a rare one in that I simply got bored about half way into the series and couldn't finish it.

Meanwhile Jungu, a not very popular guy in her school, keeps doing so many things from his heart but she is so blind to see them. The guy feels superior during ALL the dorama, at least, I was waiting him to realise he may be a very good student, but she is superior in other aspects but nope... That doesn't happen. He even puts many conditions to her. We will marry if you study more You love me, you can't love another guy You are too ugly for me, but sometimes you are pretty, so it's OK. etc. It's so sad and one feels pity about her. The dorama doesn't 'teach' you anything. Directors should have insisted in the fact that being successful at school doesn't mean you are superior than others, they should have make a situation in which this 'perfect' guy fails... They should have made him suffer like Oh Haani, who is suffering % of the chapters. Even the little brother of him, keeps insulting her. The message of this dorama is so sad, it makes you think that being loved is like winning a prize, HE feels he is a prize, a golden award that SHE has to make a LOT of effort to win. affff, stupid arrogant."}, "91": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "814": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "914": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "181": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1308": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "608": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "I've been watching a ton of Korean movies on NF in the last two years, and now they're starting to get Korean TV shows, so I decided to give this one a try. The first episode was very well done; funny characters, good acting and directing, good music with little or no synths, and an interesting plot. We figured the rest of the series would be the same, but it got kind of repetitive after a while; the same music cues repeated endlessly, sometimes inappropriate for the scene, and almost always overly sentimental. They milked the Dickensian plot for twenty episodes, and it got kind of stupid after a while, but you get hooked because you want to find out who the killer was, who ordered him to kill the mother, etc... The humor (a lot of it unintentional) also kept us watching. It was aimed at a younger audience, so there was nothing in it that wouldn't fit into a G rating.

I've seen worse, but not lately (It's worse than CATWOMAN, even!). I usually find something good to write about in all the Asian films I watch, especially the Korean comedies. This one has absolutely nothing. It's not funny, it's not romantic, and i already have  year old that whines all day long, so why would i want to kill nearly  more hours of my day listening to a grown man do it. The only saving grace is the lead actress, but unfortunately it is for her beauty and not her acting.Save your dollars for the better comedic films like My Wife is a Gangster,  Days with Mr. Arrogant or even Please Teach Me English.

Among many Korean movies I've watched, I think this movie has a little more depth to it then some other Korean movies with simpler plots. This movie takes place in the southern region of South Korea, and about % of the dialogue is in southern dialect, meaning very unique and distinctive words expressions which are very hard to translate in English while carrying the full intended meaning. For example, one of the ending lines of the movie quotes, I will protect her until I paint the walls with my poop, in Korean (before translation) this is a very comical and meaningful line, but when translated in English as above, it sounds rather awkward than funny. In addition, there are parts in the movie which may seem very very strange and weird (or simply difficult to understand or find funny) to viewers who aren't Asian. Some parts of the movie may only be understandable to it's actually intended meaning if the viewer had lived in Asia(??) I have lived in Canada for over  years and can see the different perspectives of the Asian viewers and the other viewers on this movie. Anyways, I found this movie GREAT!!! and recommend it to any viewers looking to look (more) into Asian culture, or are willing to challenge themselves with trying to understand what the actors plot actually mean, other wise I recommend other Korean comedies such as my sassy girl or  days with Mr.Arrogant.

Anyway thisis a must see!"}, "328": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "This show is so annoying I registered an account just to tell you how bad it is. **spoilers throughout** Without a doubt, the worst thing that occurs in this entire show is the dancing with joy for having found a pack of ramen noodles in slow mo scene, which lasts at least   minutes and has romantic background music while the male lead stares at her like he's falling in love. What else is wrong with this scene? Well, the girl is so emaciated it is hardly believable that if she ever eats ramen that she keeps it down. Her clothes don't stop you from seeing her bare bones poking out now and then throughout the series. The acting is so bad, especially while dancing with ramen that you feel like fingernails are scraping out the inside of your brain, it's that painful. Thankfully, streaming allows you to skip a lot by jumping ahead. Oh, right, another thing I had to skip a lot: the fight porn in the first several episodes. Antagonizingly long fight scenes that reminded me of 's movies. Ugh. True bad ass fighters don't take that long to take out a bunch of guys, so it just doesn't work. Oh, and let's not forget the  naked guys in a communal shower fight scene, which also lasted a long time. Skip. Skip. Skip. I know right? And I actually like guys. Didn't anyone ask what is the point of this scene being so long? Shaky cam throughout. Even when totally inappropriate. Yeah, film makers snobbily call it found footage like that makes it more classy, but it's still annoying as hell when not used properly. There were a couple of times it was giving me a headache and I had to look away or skip ahead. Contrived. That style of camera work is best when it fits the action or adds something to the scene. Genre switching like nobody's business. Usually this is a political action thriller type of show, but once in a while they forced the actors to act like they were in a romantic comedy and then there would be cheesy romantic comedy music that didn't fit in AT ALL   and so makes you want to vomit. The characters in those moments had to act so inconsistent to their character from the rest of the show that I felt bad for them. The romance wasn't believable either at all. I don't think that girl is very good, specifically. Except when she's yelling and screaming at people. She seems good at that. The cutesy romantic parts felt like a plot device that the director didn't have the slightest idea how to deal with. Okay, so there's this Snow White theme going on with an evil stepmother mastermind and a magic mirror, which is a little sci fi fantasy, so felt like it was bending the genre a bit as well. However, the evil stepmother character was really well played and pretty interesting. She was so good it made me wish they had just eliminated the female love interest, who was terrible, and just let the evil stepmother carry it. The only reason I'm giving this a  and not a zero is because the stepmother subplot was so entertaining and believable. Unfortunately, most of the side characters were really well acted and believable, but the female love interest was bad enough, shallow enough, superficial enough to ruin the show, and the male lead appears to have been forced to do some shitty scenes on that account. His acting is great when that stupid girl isn't around. :P   Also, you have to suck at making TV shows to make that guy look stupid. Because he is super cute. After the first several episodes they seem to have some of their bad directorial choices put in check as the fight porn gets minimized somewhat or is better incorporated with the story later. There's still some painfully superficial romantic scenes throughout that are not believable. Like   oh, right, when the female love interest is dying from allergic shock and it's this big tense moment of trying to save her and   oh   the guy has to give her some mouth to mouth because she stops breathing   what do you think is most appropriate? None other than trashy romance music exploding out of nowhere, because a girl dying is soooooo sexy. That was probably the most insulting thing I had to watch as a viewer. Really? Someone thinks it's trashy romance sexy when someone is unconscious and dying. F.U. Look though, if you really want to check out this show, a few episodes of Healer will wash that taste right out of your mouth when you're done. No problem.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "I finished the k two weeks ago. I really enjoy this drama very much. The drama has flaws of course but it is very entertaining at least to me. A mercenary soldier was framed for the murder of civilians or his own girlfriend and he was on the run. Later he would be joining to the bodyguards team of one of the president candidate family then he would be called Kim Jeha or the code name K. There he got a job to watch over the candidate secret daughter who could ruin the candidate career if she is made known to the public as his daughter.Go Anna was a secret daughter of the president canditate with a famous actress who died and not with his legal wife Choi Yoo Jin who is one of the main villain of our story. One thing is that she really is ambitious to make her family stronger by making her husband a president. She also kept Go Anna as her victim by not letting her see the father and very manipulating with the girl's mind. She could kill anyone who she think will come into her way. Many people are drawn by this character. The actress playing role is really great. Choi Yoo Jin has reasons for her to become evil. She has soft spot for Kim Jeha since he saved her life though she ordered him get killed at first. Jeha joined her side only they had one enemy or the competent another candidate who got Jeha framed for murder. Jeha was a compassionate upright guy who pity the weak or someone who does not have much power. He pity Go Anna for being the victim of her stepmother and her own father. She was all alone like him to which lead him to fall in love with her i think. They both have childlike behavior too as seen in episode  when he was looking at her eating ramen and dance happily from CCTV. Jeha is very protective of her and she depends on him quite a lot. She dislike her stepmother for keeping her like this and think she also killed her own mother. In the middle of drama the Choi Yoo Jin's half brother try to make her want to revenge against his sister since he hates his sister and want to be more powerful. Anna give in to him for a time. But at the end of day the it was not the revenge she actually want. She is just finding herself and her past. She really depend on Jeha and care for him most since he is most concern with her being. Although he is fierce fighter, jeha is so smitten with her. They were just breath of fresh air in this dark drama. One more thing i do not think Anna was a weak character but a strong one because we see she try to run away from her own situation to find her father who she long for; who she think loves her and she loves. But she got the warmness she long for from Jeha instead. She might be stupid at a time but i think she is very brave in her situation. As for Choi Yoo Jin, her power come from her family. She is destined to be evil. Her father was a ruthless man just like how she became. She was competing with her relatives who hates her. She got a good_for_nothing husband who cheats on her. So yep she become a selfish villain. Yet she was very fond of Jeha; not in a romantic way. She was fond of him for his humanity and bravery and being a super hero. But it was too late for her to become good. I was so into these three characters. The political plots were good too. The only problem is that we do not learn Kim Jeha's background very much which i pretty much want to know.for examples like who his parents were and who is he really. I took one point off for this.

Then you will be rewarded with feisty girls, pretty boy actors (flower boys), excellent cinematography, catchy music scores and sweeping stories like Moon Lovers.The plot: During a total eclipse of the sun, a  year old st century woman, Go Ha jin (Lee Ji Eun), is transported back in time to Goryeo Dynasty. She wakes up in the year , in the body of  year old Hae Soo and there, she encounters the many royal princes of the ruling family. She initially falls in love with the gentle and warm th Prince Wang Wook (Kang Ha Neul), and later with Wang So (Lee Joon Gi), the mutilated th Prince who hides his scarred face behind a mask. He's surnamed wolf dog, because he had to fight wolves when he was still young and was treated badly as a hostage. Now he likes to foster his image as a fearsome beast. There's a fight for the throne going on. Hae Soo finds herself caught between it all. Thanks to her history lessons at school she comes to realize Wang So will win this battle finally. He'll become the future king of Goryeo, and a bloody tyrant at that. Soo loves So, but she also fears him. Can she change her lover into a better ruler in time? The Good: The first meeting of the 'Moon Lovers', Hae Soo and Wang So, sets the tone for the whole series: old fashioned romance but a love that hurts. There's the black Wolf Prince riding his war horse, first endangering Hae Soo but saving her as well by lifting her in the saddle in front of him. Then there's the extended closeup of their faces, sitting opposite each other, bouncing up and down, having their eyes on each other while the music plays their love theme. The next scene he seems afraid of his own feelings and So drops Soo to the ground. Their love is painful, literally.Leading man Lee Joon Gi is simply the best actor available for that kind of TV making. The minute he appears on the screen I am glued to his face and facial expressions despite his mask, that renders all kinds of emotions like joy, pain, embarrassment, hate. Notwithstanding his well performed fighting scenes, he's in danger of becoming a modern Rudolph Valentino, with female fans only. I hope he'll get the chance to proof himself in less romantic roles playing more tormented characters like the lead in Man on High Heels ()for example.The Bad: Moon Lovers is a remake of the Chinese series 'Scarlet Heart' with  episodes. The original version could handle all the princes and their love interests. The Korean production however should have cut some story lines to flesh out the characters of Soo and So, who are the protagonists, giving them more time to develop their romance. Now we were misled thinking Wang Wook was Soo's Prince Charming. Kang Ha Neul gives a stunning performance, so it was no punishment to watch him stealing screen time from Lee Joon Gi. But the story lines became too difficult to tell, leaving plot holes until the very end. Also there are still questions unanswered: is this all about(moon)love? Or altering history? Who knows?Nevertheless I would highly recommend this series.

This doctor soon realizes Shi Ohn's autism allows him to absorb and retain all sorts of medical knowledge that a normal person couldn't. Shi Ohn is encouraged to learn and study everything he can until he grows to adulthood, wherein he's given an internship at a children's hospital to see if he can put his extraordinary mind to use in real world practice.Unfortunately, the autism that makes Shi Ohn so knowledgeable in the first place, also makes it difficult for him to communicate with people and grasp the nuances of social interaction in an imperfect society. He can't express his emotions properly, has trouble understanding his own feelings, and can't comprehend why people act and do the things they do (much less understand lies, jokes, ulterior motives, etc). Since he's both incredibly book smart and socially awkward, he's as equally resented as he is feared by his contemporaries; his genius might be able to solve problems they cannot, but he also might do something incredibly stupid that would put lives and careers at risk. Thus, a tentative relationship is born between Shi Ohn and everyone that now surrounds him to see if he can begin to fit in to society and be of help to the hospital and its patients.This is a little bit of an unusual show for a K drama. It's more of a straight forward drama about the growth of an autistic man, and those around him, more than anything else. It does retain many familiar elements of this genre; there's some melodrama, antagonists, character growth, a little humor, and somewhat of a romantic angle, but if you're looking for some juicy or outrageous or angst ridden makjang drama, this ain't the show for you.Joo Won is the star of the show in his portrayal of Shi Ohn. This could not have been an easy part to play, but Joo Won is up to the task and remarkably believable throughout. He's got all the autistic mannerisms and ticks down pat, but more impressive is the way he's able to convey his emotions in such an effective manner without breaking character. He has to deal with a lot; being bullied, reconciling with his estranged parents, sorting out his first feelings of love, living on his own, making friends, handling disappointment, and overcoming his disability, all while he's trying to prove himself as a capable doctor and basically just get by in life. Joo Won really drives this show with his performance, and the more things progress, the more you can almost sense what he's thinking & feeling without him even uttering a word. Nicely done, Joo Won!Joo Sang Wook & Moon Chae Won fill the other  most prominent parts; Joo Sang Wook plays the head doc in charge of the children's ward, and Moon Chae Won plays the prominent young female doc in the wing. Both of them were quite efficient at portraying opposite ends of the spectrum that help Shi Ohn in their own way. He's demanding and won't approve of Shi Ohn until he's satisfied, and she's kindly and supportive of Shi Ohn at almost every turn.

This doctor soon realizes Shi Ohn's autism allows him to absorb and retain all sorts of medical knowledge that a normal person couldn't. Shi Ohn is encouraged to learn and study everything he can until he grows to adulthood, wherein he's given an internship at a children's hospital to see if he can put his extraordinary mind to use in real world practice.Unfortunately, the autism that makes Shi Ohn so knowledgeable in the first place, also makes it difficult for him to communicate with people and grasp the nuances of social interaction in an imperfect society. He can't express his emotions properly, has trouble understanding his own feelings, and can't comprehend why people act and do the things they do (much less understand lies, jokes, ulterior motives, etc). Since he's both incredibly book smart and socially awkward, he's as equally resented as he is feared by his contemporaries; his genius might be able to solve problems they cannot, but he also might do something incredibly stupid that would put lives and careers at risk. Thus, a tentative relationship is born between Shi Ohn and everyone that now surrounds him to see if he can begin to fit in to society and be of help to the hospital and its patients.This is a little bit of an unusual show for a K drama. It's more of a straight forward drama about the growth of an autistic man, and those around him, more than anything else. It does retain many familiar elements of this genre; there's some melodrama, antagonists, character growth, a little humor, and somewhat of a romantic angle, but if you're looking for some juicy or outrageous or angst ridden makjang drama, this ain't the show for you.Joo Won is the star of the show in his portrayal of Shi Ohn. This could not have been an easy part to play, but Joo Won is up to the task and remarkably believable throughout. He's got all the autistic mannerisms and ticks down pat, but more impressive is the way he's able to convey his emotions in such an effective manner without breaking character. He has to deal with a lot; being bullied, reconciling with his estranged parents, sorting out his first feelings of love, living on his own, making friends, handling disappointment, and overcoming his disability, all while he's trying to prove himself as a capable doctor and basically just get by in life. Joo Won really drives this show with his performance, and the more things progress, the more you can almost sense what he's thinking & feeling without him even uttering a word. Nicely done, Joo Won!Joo Sang Wook & Moon Chae Won fill the other  most prominent parts; Joo Sang Wook plays the head doc in charge of the children's ward, and Moon Chae Won plays the prominent young female doc in the wing. Both of them were quite efficient at portraying opposite ends of the spectrum that help Shi Ohn in their own way. He's demanding and won't approve of Shi Ohn until he's satisfied, and she's kindly and supportive of Shi Ohn at almost every turn.

It's sad to see that some of you are too busy critiquing the lack of complexity in the plot, because it is this simplicity that makes this movie so beautiful. Since many of you have already reiterated the plot, i'll just cut the chase and try to clear up some confusion, hopefully.First of all, to understand why he let the girl go and turns against his boss, the flashback towards the end is very crucial. When she plays the cello, he smiles, and as he is dying, he smiles as he listens to her voice. These are the only two occasions in which he smiles throughout the entire movie. Whether this is love, attraction, or because he was thankful that she made him feel good, is open to interpretation. Given that he is an extremely straightforward and honest character(and also given that in this movie, everything is what you see on the screen  there are no hidden motives, twists, whatsoever), I assume that the reason he doesn't answer (or CAN'T answer) when asked why he did it by his boss is because he doesn't know himself. I think the key to understanding this movie is the title, and the narration at the end of the movie (something along the line of a disciple telling his master that he cries after a sweet dream because he knows it can't come true). For Sunwoo,the girl and his belief(?) that he can kill everyone else and still live are sweet dreams that cannot come true. The reason why he unrealistically gets by after getting shot and stabbed so much, is not simply because he is the main character, but because everything he does after meeting the girl is like a sweet 'dream', a surreal reality(yes, an oxymoron, just like the title  a 'bittersweet' life). The morbid ending is also very fitting  as sweet as the dream was, the more bitter it is when he wakes up from it and faces reality(once again relating to the last narration)."}, "94": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "Devilish Joy is a drama packed with cliche and corny scenes.

I'm starting to lose track of how many of these similarly themed K drama shows I've seen over the years, and, there seems to be no shortage still being made. As the title suggests, this show squarely falls into the woman who will stop at nothing to succeed category.SPOILERS AHEAD!Our story begins in the present, where Joo Da Hae is the wife of Korea's President, and, Ha Ryu is a special prosecutor who's come to arrest her for her misdeeds. These two struggle with a gun until one gets shot (and is presumably dead), but, you can't tell which one takes the bullet. This all happens in the first  minutes of episode , and sets the stage for the story to come. The rest of the show is then told in the past, from the time Da Hae and Ha Ryu first met, on up through time, until they finally arrive back in the present.As the story unfolds, we're introduced to Da Hae & Ha Ryu in their young adult lives as they meet again after not seeing each other since they were children. They begin a relationship, and, they're both fairly likable and make for a really nice couple in the beginning. Things start to unravel for them over time though, and Da Hae soon morphs into a heartless witch with zero redeeming qualities. She eventually takes all of Ha Ryu's money and leaves him & their daughter for a wealthier man without even telling anybody. From there, Da Hae keeps on climbing the ladder of success while stepping on the throats of everyone she comes across.You'll find all the usual tropes that come with this genre; jealousy, family secrets, blackmail, allegiances, & power struggles are the norm. Even knowing what to expect, this show is often ridiculously over the top. Here's a sampling: (SPOILERS) Da Hae gets divorced, gets abducted, leaps from a moving car & goes on the run, cracks a safe & steals secret docs, slams her aunt in the face with a briefcase to make her escape, gives her father in law with the magnificently outrageous toupee a heart attack, gets her brother in law beaten to a pulp, tries to blow up her first husband with a car bomb but blows up her nd husband instead, and, sneaks off to America with the future President of Korea. All of this happens over the course of ONE SINGLE EPISODE!If that isn't enough to convince you how unhinged this show gets, this should do it: (SUPER SPOILERS) Da Hae also, directly or indirectly, gets both her brother and one of her husbands sent to prison, stabs her adoptive father to death and buries him in the woods, gets her own daughter run over and killed by a truck, kills at least one of her husbands in an accident, kills the brother of another husband and dumps him in a river, kills some unlucky medical examiner, and, kills some lady's horse for good measure. There's also various secret family bloodlines, murder suicide mysteries, identical twins, rigged elections, orphan back stories, etc. Whew!!!Your  leads are played by Park Soo Ae & Kwon Sang Woo; they're both experienced and solid throughout. Sang Woo plays Ha Ryu (& his twin brother); he does a fine enough job of portraying the pitiable man who becomes more obsessed with punishing Da Hae as the story unfolds. in addition, his body of work here is also sure to not disappoint the ladies in some of the earlier episodes. Soo Ae is the star though, and she makes for one terrific deceitful crazy woman in her portrayal of Da Hae; her role basically consists of flashing her inviting smile while simultaneously being a devious lying psychopath. She also gets the high fashion treatment throughout this show once her character is afforded some money. She looks great of course, but the sheer number of ensembles she's provided is astonishing; she practically has a new outfit to wear for each separate scene she appears in. I've never seen anything like it; even K dramas centered around the fashion industry pale in comparison to the massive wardrobe afforded De Hae's character here. But, you might as well be fashionable when you're busy killing and or ruining the lives of everyone around you!The secondary cast is suitable enough, but, they're all merely pawns on the board in the scheme of things. More or less, each of the two leads hatch various schemes to accomplish their goals, their efforts are summarily thwarted by the other, then repeat this scenario until we arrive back in the present to reveal the final conclusion. How it plays out from start to finish is outrageous and often amusing though; it can paraphrased as: Sorry your plot to burn me to death in a warehouse fire didn't work out yesterday, but I'll see you at tomorrow's board meeting where I will implement my next plan to destroy you!Ultimately, this is a tale about greed & revenge between a man and a woman; one that is almost completely devoid of any love romance angle once it hits its stride (which is a little unusual for a K drama). Despite all the killings and mayhem, it's really not that violent or action packed either. I honestly can't say this show is all that great, but it does have some enormous appeal on the guilty pleasure scale, and, I did have a good deal of fun watching it. If nothing else, I really have to hand it to the writers of this show for their relentless anything goes approach to overly dramatic storytelling.Bottom Line: It's awfully silly and beyond absurd, but, it's immensely watchable anyway (that is, if you're into this sort of thing).

That was one of the reasons the producers hired her.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Fassbinder's Berlin Alexanderplatz () was a long movie   over  hours long. The Thornbirds, Roots and other early TV mini series were long movies broken into consecutive episodes. I love a mini series as a melodrama that tells a story in the long movie format, as opposed to those that tell different stories in the same setting (like Grey's Anatomy, Mad Men and to a lesser extent Damages, Breaking Bad, and Revenge that change the story at times while keeping to a general story). In this regard, I have discovered some gems in the South Korean TV mini series of recent years.The basic melodrama is the oft repeated formula: Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl Back. This me recur in the same story. Human relations can be complex even if only the boy and girl are involved, but this complexity increases as more people are involved. If personality dynamics are properly depicted in a valid manner, and if the production is skillful, powerful emotions can be evoked in the viewer. In this way we can live many lifetimes through movies, in our one lifetime   greatly enriching our incarnate experience.These South Korean productions (seen on Netflix streaming) are first class with excellent production and direction, some terrific casting and acting (particularly from some of the females who give some matchless world class performances), brilliant musical accompaniment, and staging. What makes these so good is the way they skillfully evoke deep emotion in the viewer. South Korean movie making is superb   world class.However, the following caveats must be considered by the USA viewer. They are subtitled and some people hate this. The South Korean cultural norms, values and sanctions may sometimes seems silly or old fashioned to the USA viewer. The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation unity   sometimes reminiscence of a old Frank Capra film.Most importantly, in order for the sometimes complicated sub plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing, and this leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people, that sometimes seem to be unlikely by USA cultural standards. The viewer may wonder at times why good but trusting people are so easily manipulated and deceived by bad and selfish people, but con artists do often succeed (just look at politicians for example). However this poetic license of improbability is needed to develop the story   just accept it as occurring even though unlikely at times. Taking these factors into account Will help you become involved and emotionally engrossed. It was hard t for me to quit watching at times so I binged watched.I would rank these as follows but tastes differ and your rankings might not agree:     (hard to say which is best)Shining InheritanceWhen a Man LovesThat Winter, The Wind BlowsSecret Garden. Five Fingers. The Scent of a Woman. The Great Queen Seondeok. A Hundred Years Inheritance. Lie To me. Roof Top Prince. Dr. Jin. The Great DoctorFive Fingers is a  South Korean TV series that is a heart wrenching trip for those who watch all  episodes. The beginning episodes set the stage for the emotional fireworks that follow (and develop to the end). The plot explores the complexities of love, hate, revenge, and reparation. If you can immerse yourself in the unfolding drama, it is an emotional roller coaster ride. The many twists and turns in the plot are sometimes implausible as noted above, but ignore this and enjoy the ride."}, "416": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1248": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1147": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1010": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1023": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "669": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Marry Him if You Dare is a  episode KTV drama that aired in late . Be advised, this show has several different English titles; it's aka Mi Rae's Choice, The Future Choice, etc.This show is primarily a rom com drama with a fantasy element to it. These fantasy K drama shows never get old; but, ONLY if it's done right!...This show gets it right for the most part, and it's pretty good overall.SPOILERS AHEAD!Our story begins by introducing the main character (Mi Rae) as a struggling  something year old woman trying to find her way in the world; she's had zero luck in both her personal & professional affairs to date, and her directionless approach to life isn't helping matters any. Enter Mi Rae # ; this is the elder version of our younger Mi Rae. The elder Mi Rae has traveled back in time to stop her younger self from being an aimless loser who continually makes the wrong decisions (the results of which will ultimately be their mutual downfall).Other than the addition of the time travel premise, this show is basically a standard K drama tale involving the relationships between  girls and  guys. Yoon Eun Hye takes the lead as the younger Mi Rae; Eun Hye often plays this type of part, and she is very good in her role as usual. Veteran actress Choi Myung Gil nicely portrays the elder Mi Rae. Together, these two actresses strike a nice balance between older and younger versions of the same woman (although you will have to discount the fact that they look absolutely nothing like each other). Joining the two Mi Raes in their adventures to change the future are your  stereotypical love interest counterparts; they consist of the  hunky male leads, along with the gorgeous other girl. These  are quite good in their roles, and they're about what you'd expect from a show like this. Here's your summary of them:. TV anchorman (Lee Dong Gun): The primary male lead who the younger Mi Rae must not get involved with at all costs. He's a bit older and polished, and he quickly takes a liking to Mi Rae when she joins his broadcast team. He can be a little temperamental and stubborn at times, but is mostly appealing enough as a suitable love interest for our heroine.. Rich young business heir (Jung Yong Hwa): He's pretending to be an anonymous VJ at his family's broadcasting company while he learns the business from the ground up. He's a good looking charmer that's very reasonable despite some occasional immaturity. He represents the younger potential love interest available to Mi Rae, and, he falls for her right away too.. Reporter Girl aka the gorgeous other girl (Han Chae Ah). She just can't seem to find someone, anyone, to love her no matter how hard she tries. Suitable partners should be lining up around the block to catch this woman; alas, such is the life of being the gorgeous other girl in these K dramas. She's a bit of a sly fox when it comes to trying to land herself an appropriate guy of course, but she's far from being overly loathsome.This show gets off to a pretty decent start. The entire cast interacts really well with each other right from the get go, and no one is made out to be a true antagonist; nobody's perfect by any means, but they're all fairly amiable and well meaning for the most part. The story is fairly interesting and economically paced as well, and there's little to no time wasted on irrelevant & or pointless side plots. There's also loads of amusing extras deftly sprinkled in that provide some nice touches to the entire proceedings (from bleeped out cursing, to post production screen visuals & sound effects, to voice overs & first person camera angles, etc). Everything is kept light and tight from the beginning, and as a result, this show had all the makings of huge winner (ratings notwithstanding).Unfortunately (and, perhaps, inevitably), this show slowly begins to go in a different direction as it subtly changes its tone from mostly rom com to mainly drama. The transition is actually handled pretty well here, but the show does become a lot less charming as it progresses. It never gets terrible or overwrought with too much melodrama, but the nuances that made it incredibly appealing from the outset get stripped away one by one; gone are the comedic aspects, the catchy tunes to whistle along to, the general camaraderie and playfulness that permeated the early part of the show, and so forth. After a while, the elder Mi Rae becomes somewhat of a th wheel as the 'future implications' story line is deemed less important, and, the Reporter Girl is soon rendered irrelevant to the plot as well. Eventually, even the romantic appeal to the show disappears, and, all that's left is to watch the M & F leads slog through their regular routines for a while as the story winds down.All in all, I did rather like this show, and I will recommend it. However, I'm a little disappointed that it wasn't committed to staying its original course. I sat down and started watching a witty romantic comedy with a time travel sub plot, and ended up watching a rather mundane drama about the daily lives of everyday people. The odd thing is the drama part was pretty good; it's not over the top and much closer to reality than most K dramas, and I absolutely loved how the relationships & lives of everyone involved were ultimately resolved (in the life goes on sense). I really don't have any practical complaints to levy at this show, but, it did somewhat ruin all the fun I was having (and was further expecting) when I started watching it in the first place.Bottom Line: . out of  stars."}, "1019": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "345": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "The only reason I watch this because of my favourite actor Lee.

Wow, are they bad.The first thing noticed with Korea TV shows is that they all look cheap and quickly made. Yes, there is crane and dolly work, and they seem to frown on the detestable shaky cam that plagues Western TV nowadays, but it's as if somebody said, Hey, I have a K camera, let's make a TV programme, and to hell with aesthetics.The second thing   which is also quickly noticed   is how bad the dialogue is. Films are seemingly honed to near perfection, whereas dialogue in Korean TV programmes (or, at least, in the handful I've tried to watch), meanders, repeats itself and is plain corny.City Hunter, unfortunately, isn't an exception to the above. I got one and a half episodes in before I had to question why I was subjecting myself to such nonsense!The plot plays out like a teenage melodrama disguised as an action thriller, but ridiculous coincidences, bad characters, slow pacing and action sequences massively below the level I was expecting (not to mention how infrequently their occur), soon nailed its coffin shut. There's also the tiny factor of complete implausibility, as some kid who was effectively raised in the jungle somewhere near Cambodia, is speaking with modern Korean dialect and accent, and posing as an American computer genius... despite not being able to speak a word of English or having ever seen a computer!Oh, and working for and interacting directly with the Korean president is a given, when you have a fake degree from MIT.So, if you're a fan of Korean TV already (not that I can fathom why), you may be able to overlook all the stupidity and badness and enjoy the tall lead with his spiffy hair, or the admittedly gorgeous character of Kim Na Na, regardless of how preachy and imposing she acts, but for those who love Korean cinema and are looking to give their TV a go, look elsewhere (and I hope that you find higher quality programmes than all the recommended ones that I did).", "Highest Sentiment Review": "I've been making the rounds here on IMDb offering up reviews of Korean TV shows over the last year or so (because they're sorely lacking), and tonight it's review time for City Hunter. This show aired in the summer of , and it's not half bad.SPOILERS AHEAD!I see four other people have reviewed this series already (to some wildly ranging opinions). I watch these shows all the time, and have a pretty good handle on them, so perhaps I can be of some help in providing a more balanced review. Basically, this show is standard fare for the genre; it's neither ground breaking nor spectacular, but it is mostly watchable and worth checking out if you like this sort of thing. It's pretty decent overall.Here's your story: It's late 's or early 's, and North and South Korean tensions are mounting. A group of hardened South Korean marines are tasked with infiltrating the North to kill a number of prominent military leaders at the behest of  South cabinet members and high ranking officials. During the raid, the  South leaders who masterminded the plan reverse course for political reasons, but it's too late to stop the mission. As a result, they must now eliminate the team they sent north without a trace, and they must do so at all costs in order to preserve national security and peace between the  nations.The South Korean leaders appear to be successful in eliminating their own marines. One member of the team survives the onslaught however, thanks to his long time friend in the squad who saved his life. Obliged to fulfill the wishes of his dying friend, and fearing that his friend's entire family may also be killed, he absconds with his friend's newborn son and goes on the run. This surviving team member is upset (to say the least), and he's not a man to be trifled with. He disappears into the Golden Triangle where he raises his friend's son while he rises to power & wealth in the drug supply trade. All the while, he plots eventual revenge on the  leaders back in Korea who killed his comrades in the past, and, he plans on one day using his adopted son to help him accomplish this goal. As such, the adopted son is essentially groomed from birth to carry out this plan in the future.Flash forward to  or so. The son he raised is now fully grown and inserted back into Korea. He's rich, well educated, good looking, and armed with all the training he needs to ruthlessly take revenge on the people who caused the death of his father. The  men he must dispatch have since risen to great power and are now well entrenched politically and financially, and one of them is now the South Korean President. Undaunted, father and adopted son set about their task to eliminate these evildoers one by one.Some problems arise though; the son is not the ruthlessly driven killer his adopted father is, and he starts to question and waiver on the task at hand over time. He also takes a liking to a pretty young girl along the way, who turns out to be an up and coming secret service agent in charge of protecting the president (i.e. the main target). Ahhhh!...this is a staple of KTV melodrama...everybody is somehow involved with somebody else, and all story lines & plot points intertwine & intersect with one another somehow. And every character is a rival to someone else; old against new, weak against powerful, good against evil, father against son, son against love interest, etc. How will this particular show play out these themes in the end?...Watch and see for yourself!There's a god bit to like about this show. It's often quite entertaining and fairly interesting, but it does get bogged down a little bit during its run time. It would have benefited from trimming its  show format down to about   episodes or so, but, I've been over this same ground too many times with other similar shows I've watched & reviewed; it's just the nature of airing KTV dramas, and, you're just going to have to get used to it if you endeavor to watch them.Bottom Line: I liked it for the most part, and it's certainly watchable. It is not deserving of its current lofty . rating, nor its two glowing  star ratings from the previous reviewers. But it's certainly not a  star rated pile of crap either.

This is a story that seemingly begins in the year  when a young Park Hae Young witnesses a girl getting kidnapped. The case remains unsolved as Park Hae Young's attempts to explain what really happened to the police are met with indifference.That in combination with a case very personal to Park Hae Young are enough to make him mistrust the police and the transparency of their procedures. He grows up to become a criminal profiler and one day he crosses paths with detective Cha Soo Hyun. Cha Soo Hyun has spent the last fifteen years looking for her missing partner Detective Lee Jae Han who was facing criminal charges for bribery extortion. After  years of no trace we finally get a clue of what happened to Jae Han when through his old, non functioning walkie talkie he communicates with an understandably confused Park Hae Young.

Their relationships also make me SO emotional. Especially the unusual friendship between Park Hae Young and Lee Jae Han who until the very end never meet properly and yet they grow to love each other so much.For me the most powerful and downright heartbreaking scene was when (MAJOR SPOILERS) they were both going (again seemingly) through their final moments and we had a flashback to their dialogue when each wished that the other would be happy.

I don't know where the line was drawn between being way too much and way too little. This isn't to knock the acting at all, don't get me wrong   I think all actors and actresses did really well with what they were given for the show, I think the script and character writing could have just balanced it out a bit more. I keep saying this does have a bit of a cringe factor, and truth is, if the characters had been toned down a notch or toned up a notch then I think that wouldn't have occurred   this is my own personal opinion, I know quite a few people who love it how it is.This is a show that definitely has charms. When I say it has a potential rewatch factor, there are some episodes I will definitely watch again, namely the last three. I wouldn't watch the entire season again, it's too much   especially the first few episodes. The storyline was well written, but again, it all came down to the characters themselves on why I wasn't too keen on this. Incheon Gal was way too over the top; I know she was supposed to be but it did quite get on my nerves.All in all, I think at least every EXO L should give this a try.

Think Notting Hill longer version.The show is entertaining, funny and has some great one liners and words of wisdom. I am on my second time around watching this show. Even though it took me a long time to find this show, I kept searching for it as it is a warm romantic comedy. The story builds from one crazy scene to another that's gets the main character in more and more hot water as the show progresses. As well the music really blends into the scenes very well.Why I like this show is because it still allows us (the audience) to think realize that there are still honest humble respectful people in the world. It's very easy to relate to the main character as most of us are probably like him. Spoiler Alert: The entire premise is truly unrealistic (down to earth guy meets famous actress) but it worth watching as it does get emotional at times.The story is practical from the sense that rich guy meets girl (famous actress) father doesn't approve because of his career (he is running for office). So the son has to get involved with and arranged marriage.Next enters a simple humble guy who tries to be a scapegoat for the two of them in public.

I was pretty much blown away by this series, why? Firstly acting here is superb, Ji Sung (or Ji Seong) in main role plays orphan who wants to make his way up from scum to success and live a better life. I can't understand why isn't he amazingly popular actor already, his acting was really convincing and he is also good looking fellow, which probably ain't bad thing when it comes to becoming popular either. Also gotta mention Sung Yu Ri (or Seong Yoo ri), who also makes marvelous role here as a girl with a dream and is just damn beautiful too. Rest of the cast also does great job, if I'd had to mention someone else besides ones above, it gotta be Jun Kwang Ryul (or Jeon Gwang Ryeol), who makes great role as bitter and heartless old man. As story goes on motives and ambitions of characters change, so it isn't just some simple story about thug who isn't happy with his life and wants money and success.Secondly plot is really nice and complex and there's some action in it too, it's really not basic romance drama.

Such movies like Back to the Future or Terminator are such examples of writing that gets it right. However, when they are done poorly, they are usually a hotbed of contriving, convoluted messes. And Nine: Nine Time Travels is one that gets most everything wrong.You'd think that it's bad enough to have plot holes so huge that you could drive a Sherman Tank through it, but the performances from nearly everyone in the cast is one dimensional, and in some cases, so goofy and silly that you can't help but roll your eyes and laugh.You will also laugh out loud at the worst hammer vs. baseball bat sequence ever shot. You also get a man who's struck by a car, while inside of a phone booth. If he wasn't killed on impact, he'd be rendered unable to do much of anything, assuming he was even conscious. And yet, he is able to record five messages on his phone, and have a conversation with a little girl who laughingly asks, Mister, are you hurt? Covered in blood, even an eight year old wouldn't have to ask such a pointless question. These are just two examples of characters and situations being written so badly that you can't help but chuckle. Believe me, there are plenty more in this series!Any time you sacrifice rational character actions for the sake of the plot, you've already made a mistake. This is basic plot development ! The acting by Jin Wook Lee (Sun Woo)is largely unimpressive. He manages a stoic look in nearly every situation that he's in, and a goofy smile that doesn't look real or genuine. It's like he has to try...and fails miserably!Yun hie Jo (Min Young Joo) is either flirting (badly), crying (at least have of the time) or speaking in a pouty tone that is beyond grating. Her romantic scenes with Jin Wook Lee completely lack chemistry and the girl has no clue how to do a kissing scene. Tight lipped, it's almost pathetic.Still, the worst performance easily rests with Dong Hwan Jung (Jin Chul Choi), the nemesis of our story. He has only one facial expression for nearly every situation. I don't believe he is intentionally trying to be goofy, but that's how he comes across. He is unimpressive and unbelievable in the role. I'm not sure that they could have found a worse actor for this part. I've now watched a number of Korean series. Descendants of the Sun is still, by far, one of the best series I've ever seen. Stranger is nearly equal to it. This series was a complete waste of my time. I will say that, despite the sub par terrible performances by the actors, the story held my interest for a time before everything fell apart. If you want to see one of the best time travel shows in recent years, watch Japan's Erased. You can find it on Netflix, and it is absolutely terrific!Do yourself a favor, and go with something else. Stay clear of Nine: Nine Time Travels. I'll wager that given twice the time, they'd still never get this one right.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Nine Times Time Travel is a  episode Korean TV show that aired in early . This is another modern Korean fantasy drama, albeit one that it is unusually understated and low key in comparison to most of its more melodramatic & or romantic brethren.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your basic story: A man receives a visit from his older brother shortly before said brother passes away. The older brother appeared to be insane during the visit and was claiming he had found a way to alter time. The man goes to retrieve his older brother's body and investigates his death, and he soon finds that his brother was not crazy at all; he actually had discovered the means to travel back in time via some magical incense sticks. The younger brother collects the remaining incense sticks ( of them), and thus now possesses nine chances to alter the past. Light a stick and you'll go back in time to an exact set date for  minutes until the incense burns out, then you're zapped backed to the present day (where whatever you've just done in the past is instantly reflected in the present).The story focuses primarily on the young brother, who experienced a family tragedy when he was a teen that forever impacted his life and everyone he loves. He therefore decides to use the time travel incense to change crucial events in his family's history in order to prevent this tragedy from happening in the first place. He has the best of intentions, but altering the past soon becomes much more complicated than he imagined. Every change he makes for the better in the past creates unexpected future results, and he soon finds that various friends & family members lead vastly different lives or no longer recognize him in the present. As such, he keeps going back to the past to try to undo the unintended future changes he created, but things only seem to be getting worse and soon are spiraling out of control, and, he's quickly running out of magic incense sticks to rectify the situation.From there on in, it's just a matter of seeing if this guy can somehow set things right before time runs out. Moral of the story: It's probably best to not mess around with the past no matter what your intentions are.Lee Jin Wook plays the lead and primary focal point of the show, and he's quite good in what is an understated role. Everyone else is mostly a supporting character, and they're pretty good in their roles too (particularly the love interest in the present, and the younger versions of everybody in the past). Although, I must say I could've done without some of the overacting from the evil scientist dude and the lead's doctor friend...and, while I'm on the subject, I've never understood why the directors of some these KTV shows would want or allow actors to perform in this manner. In this medium, overacting occurs far too often with the some of the side characters; constantly flashing a clumsy menacing stare or wildly waving your arms around does not help make a character more evil or funnier, respectively. It doesn't work and its distracting more than anything else, and you usually end up occasionally chuckling at the supposed bad guy and growing annoyed of the guy who's supposed to be the friendly comic relief. A lot less brooding & mugging, and a little more subtlety for these  particular characters is definitely in order here, as is also true with many other non protagonist characters on many other Korean dramas.This show doesn't seem to have a whole lot of money to throw around, but it never looks overly cheap; productions values are solid for its given budget, but there is very little excess in any form or fashion to be had here. It's paced well enough, and the story & writing is quite good as well; it almost seems that this was written in advance (and, not on the fly, like most K dramas are). The interactions across time, between the younger and older versions of the same protagonist, are quite well done in particular.There's definitely a minimalistic feel to this entire show (which I found to be somewhat refreshing for this genre), and this approach extends itself to the story as well; it retains many familiar melodramatic elements & themes & story lines that you'll find in this genre, but it does so w o love quadrangles, meticulously styled auxiliary antagonists, etc. For Korean TV, this is basically a no frills drama about the implications of trying to change your past, and overall, it is quite good at accomplishing this.Summary: This is a subdued, and rather well done, KTV time travel melodrama that I rather enjoyed for the most part. Yeah, it's got some flaws, but what K drama doesn't? I can see that it might not play all that well to some of the masses that most K dramas are geared towards, as it's just neither a very flashy, sexy, or romantic soap opera type of show. There's nothing wrong with flashy sexy romantic K dramas, and I like some of those shows too, but if you don't necessarily need or want a show like that, while still getting your K drama fix on, this show might work quite well for you.Bottom Line: . out of  stars!Very Well Recommended!"}, "1349": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "149": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Surprisingly an enjoyable drama.

No dignity for pilots and mechanics. This movie didn't do justice to them. What I want is serious piloting and commanders showing tactical thought, excellent mechanical understanding of aircraft, excellent weapons systems mix between missiles and dogfights, with clear plausible combat scenarios.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "While Top Gun  never made it off the ground, given the passing of Tony Scott, and more importantly, the lack of a credible rogue nation enemy (even Top Gun had the pilots battle unidentified enemy bogeys that had generic communist markings on the MiGs), the clear and present danger that South Korea faces in the threats from the North, gives it the bandwidth to craft a scenario that's fully plausible, with the film industry taking certain liberties with the maneuverability of the planes they feature, but hey, it's movie making, so a little fantasy to spice up some aerial dogfights is more than expected for entertainment's sake.For fans hungry for air combat scenes, this film featured plenty of stunts, effects, and battles that really made Top Gun look very dated, especially in its adoption of more fanciful camera work that seemed to fluidly move around the aircraft when it's in rapid motion in the air. Views are offered in and around the cockpit bubble, sometimes slowed down for somewhat comical staring of daggers between opponents. There's the usual dogfights between planes   having the F  do battle against its arch rival the MiG    is pure delight for any combat aviation fan, and if my eyes didn't play tricks on me, look out for the MiG's fabled cobra maneuver   I'd almost jump out of my seat with disbelief and glee when that happened.Soar into the Sun has a whole host of arsenal deployed and missions to fulfill, such as air to  air, surface to air, air to surface missiles, anti aircraft guns, and missions from routine patrols, infiltration, and search and rescue all making it one holistic look at the workings of an air force. And what's more, not only do fighter pilots get in on the action, but attention being paid to the ground technical crew who keep the planes in tip top condition in between sorties, as well as ground commandos in extraction missions using their fixed wing aircraft, trained to rescue pilots who are downed behind enemy lines   and yes, this is yet another subplot that managed to find its way into the narrative, based on the John Moore film in  starring Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson in his rare outing as an action hero.Rain completed this film before heading toward his obligatory national service, and here he plays hotshot (what else?) pilot Jung Tae Hoon, who's the youngest in the acrobatic Black Eagles team, flying the FA  T Golden Eagle (flown by Indonesia and South Korea's air force only), which is a trainer and multi role fighter. But his decision to spice up a routine air show wasn't appreciated, and he also becomes the fastest to get sacked from the acrobatic team, being redeployed to an operationally ready squadron because its commanding officer believes that his talent with an aircraft shouldn't be gone to waste.What is probably unheard of if this is done by Hollywood, is to admit that the main protagonist isn't the perfect all rounder he is. It's established early on that Tae Hoon is the specialist in low flying, so he isn't quite cut out, as scenes would prove, that he's dogfight material. so this means Rain having to step aside and share the limelight with Yu Jun Sang as Major Lee, who is their squadron's ace. And although the F K variant here is obviously the aircraft of choice and the superior fighter in the film, it's a nod toward Korean pride to have its lead fly the FA  T  Golden Eagle for his final, all important mission that delivered the payload.The money shot is of course what you've caught a glimpse of in the trailer, where two F s are hot on the heels of a MiG , or at times, vice versa, as they storm through the skyscape of Seoul. The stunt and visual effects team did a great job to create that urban battle scenario, and yes I'm raving about that cobra maneuver again. Aerial combats in the film are sleekly choreographed, and the brownie points come in watching this in a theatre with optimal sound, because you'll be able to hear the roar of the planes' afterburners when they kick in.So I guess it's enough on the hardware and the technical aspects of Soar into the Sun, so what about the storyline? It's perfunctory to say the least, with balance achieved in providing the myriad of characters their particular idiosyncrasies and one note role in the narrative. There's the token love interest for Tae Hoon in Sergeant Se Young (Shin Se Kyung), the prettiest and most competent technical ground crew around, her boss and comic relief played by Oh Dal  Su, fellow co pilot Yoo Jin (Lee Ha Na), and the rookie (Lee Jong Suk) whom I do not know how he'd pass the pilot qualifying tests for his frequent fainting spells when subjected to high G forces.Soar into the Sun, also known as RB: Return to Base, is pure entertainment, where the story didn't really do much, with odd screwball comedy thrown around, it does provide one heck of an adrenaline ride. Rain fans will celebrate at an obligatory scene where their idol appears topless, but the real stars of the film, are the military hardware on display. And this scores from every angle you're seeing this film from. So I'd give it a biased definite recommendation!"}, "1292": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "849": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "819": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1067": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1090": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "579": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "359": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "A light romance drama, which was based, however, on a silly idea.

But this detective is also on a quest to exact revenge on the man who violently ruined his family's life  years ago. The journey will inevitably take some unexpected turns. This is a film that may divide audiences, due to its off kilter approach to a number of different genres, time periods and visual styles, using the framework of a hard  boiled detective story to metaphorically glance at various hardships Korea has endured over the past  years. It takes a little while for the film's rhythm to take hold, but once it does and you completely click into its particular point of view, it becomes more entertaining as it goes on. Writer director Jo Sung hee, who impressed with the minimalist, post apocalyptic END OF ANIMAL and the romance drama fantasy A WEREWOLF BOY, again moves down a different path, with a film that is heavily influenced by comic books and pulp crime novels. His smart blend of camera technique, lighting schemes, CGI animation, and set design makes this a feast for the eyes, and if it is screening at a cinema nearby, then I highly recommend that you go and experience it on the big screen.Lee Je hoon, who caught people's attention with his performances in the first rate but appropriately titled BLEAK NIGHT and the acclaimed Korean War drama THE FRONT LINE, is very good as detective Gil dong, and the relationship that develops between he and the two girls is genuinely affecting. However, he doesn't quite command the screen in the way needed to make a film like this truly soar (say like Park Hae il), but on the strength of his work here, you know that day is not far away. Kim Seong gyoon proves intimidating as the brutal Kang Sung il, but the film is stolen by young actors Kim Ha na (as Mal soon) and No Jeong ee (as Dong yi), who are utterly charming as Gil dong's hindrance come helpers. The director gets remarkably natural and confident performances from the two youngsters, thankfully free of cloyingly sweet mannerisms and cheap sentimentality.The less you know about the plot details the better, as Jo Sung hee's final vision may be somewhat contrary to what you might be expecting. But it's a surprise that definitely leaves a smile on your face when the end credits begin to roll, and has you already looking forward to what this talented film maker will do next."}, "730": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "One of my non mainstream (being neither Asian nor living there) TV pleasures is Korean dramas   I first got hooked on the historic costume dramas (e.g. Jumong and Emperor of the Sea) about  years ago, and more recently have also started watching some of the contemporary ones. The local K TV cable channel recently ran The Queen of Office (sic), a Korean adaptation of the  Japanese drama Pride of the Temp in a late night time slot. It's a funny, enjoyable office comedy romance farce, but with a serious tale of the rise of a  tier workforce as a backdrop. Here is the title sequence narration:It's been  years since the Asian financial crisis. Korea now has  million contract workers. South Koreans' foremost dream is no longer national reunification. It is getting a permanent position. While everyone else yearns for a permanent position, there is someone who has consciously opted to be a contract worker. Ms. Kim is Korea's first ever contract worker by choice. Ms. Kim never works for free. She doesn't forge cumbersome interpersonal ties. After her three month contract period, she always leaves Korea. But no one knows how she's come to call herself Ms. Kim and chosen to be a serial contract worker.First, some comments about the more serious job market backdrop for the series. In this fictional play, Ms. Kim does the exact opposite of what at will employment for low pay and zero job security or prospects of advancement generally results in   she manages to amass the kinds of experience in each  month stint which normally requires decades of work at a job and the kind of dedication that results from employer employee reciprocity, the latter being a near extinct beast in the modern 'globalized' jobs landscape. But the series does a good job conveying the financial employment parlousness suffered by Ms. Kim's less exceptional fellow contract workers. The popular Naked Capitalism blog, whose motto is Fearless commentary on finance, economics, politics and power, refers to the ever increasing number of workers who have seen what were formerly steady jobs with decent benefits replaced by low paid, at will, benefit less contract positions as the precariat, in reference to the precariousness of their employment and, as a result, their lives in general. We can thank the global neoliberal economic project for this trend. Is it any wonder that the world is seeing   belatedly, to be sure   a large scale backlash against this elite greed driven system, in the form of things like Brexit and the rise of populist and anti globalization political figures such as Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in the U.S. and Marine Le Pen in France?But, back to the merits of the TV series   because of the strong element of farce in the series, viewers expecting any form of plausibility in the relationship between the two lead characters, Ms. Kim (Kim Hye Su) and the curly perm sporting chauvinist Jang Gyujik (Oh Ji Ho, who many fans of Korean drama will be familiar with by way of his more recent serious turn in the heartrending  family drama My Fair Lady, and whose character name here is a pun on the Korean phrase for permanent employee). Nevertheless the writers manage to balance the comedy with a slower developing long story arc about a deeper hidden connection shared by the two leads. There are also fine performances by the supporting cast, most notably in form of the characters Mr. Mu (Lee Hee Jun), Gyujik's extremely reserved longtime colleague and friend at Y Jang Food Company, and Jang Ju Ri (Jung Yu Mi), a young female contract worker from a second tier university hired around the same time as Ms. Kim, but whose situation more realistically depicts the lot of the temp worker. My personal favorite episode is the one in which Ms. Kim, Gyujik and Mr. Mu are dispatched to appear in a role playing exercise for the benefit of an audience of young schoolchildren at the nearby Soybean Paste Academy, wherein Mr. Rice Straw has an unfortunate run in with Ms. Lump of Raw Bean Paste, and hilarity ensues. I rate this show  , more on the strength of its strong physical comedy aspects than its character relationships and dramatic aspects."}, "70": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "976": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "652": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1024": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1276": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "804": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "The first time I saw a trailer of this on Youtube, I thought it was something related with that Walking with Dinosaurs movie from the year . Anyway, this wasn't anything particularly memorable, having many predictable clich\u00e9s from other movies about Dinosaurs: I guess the Disneyfied plot and anthropomorphic behavior exhibited by the dinosaurs in this film would have been more tolerable if it wasn't for the incredibly annoying voice over narration, which constantly explains the viewers what is already happening on screen. Besides of being obvious and redundant, it makes all the most dramatic and intense moments of the plot to lose its effect, feeling more like a forced attempt to make the story more kid friendly. And that is a shame, because there were a couple of genuinely interesting scenes which had the potential to made this movie something much more interesting than it actually turned out to be.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "(Note, this review MAY contains Spoilers!)I remember watching this movie on YouTube two years ago. I was initially pessimistic about it, considering that this movie is Korean. As I watched more, I couldn't help but find myself liking this film. After all, I am a lover of dinosaurs and its quite badass having a Tarbosaurus as the protagonist.To start off, the story is basic: The life of a Tarbosaurus named Speckles. Initially having a happy life, his family and life is shattered when a Tyrannosaurus named One Eye appears usurps their territory, killing them in the process. What follows is the tribulations and struggle of Speckles who tries to survive during his lifetime. Overtime, we get to see his character mature as he grows up.So, what are my thoughts of this film? As stated before, I like this film. For kids, it is an enjoyable dino flick and I think the film is suitable for families of all ages. However for dino nerds and professional critics, its a hard watch as many usually point out the lack of logic and the excessive flaws of any film possible (Even the best ones).The Good: To start off, I like the character of Speckles. You can quickly empathise with him and his maturity and growth over the course of the story is very well done. Other characters include Blue Eyes (Another major character), Speckles's family and One Eye (The antagonist) who while somewhat generic, seem to serve their purpose quite well. One Eye is a character that you WILL hate, so that's a good plus for me. The animation is brilliant and that's what I think is the movie's best element, considering that Speckles was meant to be a D film. The story is simplistic, but I think it works and flows with the coming of age genre quite decently. Aside from the titular Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, there are also several dinosaurs not known to the public (E.g. Tsintaosaurus, Therizinosaurus, Pukyongosaurus and Charanosaurus) featured which I think helps the film in being colourful and more diverse in establishing different fauna. Lastly, the music of the film is superb in my opinion. It catches the mood quite effectively and provides a sense of adventure and thrill in this film.The Bad: Not every film is perfect.The same can be said for Speckles. Firstly, the film's story is shown through narration, which goes through different voice overs depending on Speckles's age. Needless to say, it was insipid (Especially the narrator for infant Speckles) and I felt it was distracting and a juvenile attempt to make the film more geared towards kids. While there is a good species number of dinosaurs in this film, its easy to point out that several of them are actually FROM North America (Tyrannosaurus, Torosaurus and Ankylosaurus for example). Some animals are even over exaggerated (One species reaching lengths of a  feet, despite being way smaller!). One Eye also seems to resemble Scar from The Lion King (Notice that BOTH have scars) and are cunning, but I'd say both are good villains in their own right.In conclusion, Speckles the Tarbosaurus results in it's pros slightly overpowering its cons to make itself known as a film kids could enjoy. There are heart warming scenes which while depressing, also makes the story a little bit more forced when it comes to empathising with Speckles, but they are sad nonetheless. For dino nerds, its a mixed bag and its a tough call when it comes to watching something realistic about dinosaurs. However, Speckles the Tarbosaurus makes for a good substitute and I'd say its an enjoyable film. For anyone who was kids who love dinosaurs, I'd say give them a watch. You'll let me know :).For my evaluation in terms of story, characters, music, animation and my own personal enjoyment, I would give Speckles a . out of ten. My best recommendation is that you should rather watch the movie on YouTube rather than just buying it. Kids will love this film and adults will find it heart warming and depressing Overall, its a good dinosaur film albeit with its own set of flaws and a nice departure from NOT using well known dinosaurs (E.g. Apatosaurus) as the protagonist, having shifted to a lesser known species (Tarbosaurus) for a boosting popularity."}, "1142": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "The Virtual Bride (aka The Eccentric Daughter in Law) is a  episode KTV drama from the summer of .SPOILERS AHEAD!Story: A struggling young idol agrees to star in a variety show in order to gain popularity for her and the girl idol group she's a member of. This fake variety show involves her going to live and work with the mother of the guy she's pretend dating, along with said guy, and their extended family.This shows stars Kim Dasom (I don't know what her actress name or real life name is, but she's a member of the idol group Sistar). I am familiar with Sistar and who Dasom is, but this my first exposure to her as an actress. She has participated in two other TV dramas prior to this, but they were both well over  episodes, and I have neither the time nor inclination to watch shows of that length. The first thing you should know about Dasom is that she is SMOKING hot (just like all of her Sistar idol mates). The entire group is built (ahem) to be as sexy as possible, while still trying to exhibit a cute and fun appeal at the same time; go watch some of their music videos and you'll see what I'm referring to. Can Dasom act though?, and, is this show worthwhile?...well, let's find out!As our story begins, Dasom's character (Oh In Young) makes her way to the variety show set (which takes place in a farm home setting which prepares various traditional Korean food & sauces for restaurants & other buyers). This is a place that requires you to work hard and get your hands dirty. In Young, however, loves her high heels and skimpy flashy outfits and she's ill suited for this environment at first. As such, the family she's moved in with disapproves of her right away, but they've agreed to do the show, and if it's well received, their business will prosper (and so will In Young and her idol group & company). Over time, the show becomes popular as In Young fits in a little better, and starts slowly winning over the entire family and their ever discerning family matriarch. And of course, she and her nerdy but handsome fake show love interest costar begin to have actual feelings for each other.You'll immediately notice this show has a pretty low budget. That's OK, but you must compensate for fiscal restraints by having some combination of a good story, solid writing, proper direction, and stellar acting performances. Unfortunately, this show doesn't really do any one of those things very well. You know you're in for some pain and suffering when the first couple of episodes consist mainly of a midriff baring lead having multiple gassy fart problems, followed by the introduction of several stereotypical self centered & annoying Korean cinema mothers, followed by a bunch of mama boys that need to grow up, followed by younger female characters who are searching for self empowerment. YUK!The second thing you'll notice about this show is that it resembles a long running day time Korean soap opera that's been compressed to  episodes and played on fast forward. Almost every scene consists of a one or two minute interaction between one or more cast members, then it's on to the next one or two minute scene. The way it's scripted and framed doesn't help matters either; it consists mainly of a close up shot of Character A reading a single line, then a close up of Character B reading a single line, then repeat some back and forth like this until the end of their short scene. At the end of each scene, someone references or mentions something about a rd party not involved in the current scene. Then, cut away to said rd party having their own short scene, then continue this formula FOREVER until the show eventually concludes.Because of how the scenes are written, there never seems to be any personal interaction or meaningful communication among any of the character. It feels like everyone is just reading lines and nothing more. All of the characters involved are supposed to evolve over time, but it's a very cumbersome & repetitive process along the way; someone accepts someone, then turns their back on them, then accepts them again; this pattern of behavior is repeated often throughout this show between multiple characters, and, it really becomes tedious and just plain absurd as the show drags on. As a result, this show is severely lacking in any depth, and it fails to ever build any suspense, tension, or momentum.The cast does what they're asked, and they mostly do OK (but just barely). There are several insufferable performances though, and no standout ones. The cast's star power and  or acting prowess (or lack thereof) isn't the problem here though; where this show fails clearly lies at the feet of the writers and the director. Good K dramas build towards their climax and include multiple important scenes where you can't take your eyes off the screen, which in turn, engages the viewer to invest in the story, care about its characters, and look forward to the next episode. Sadly, this show doesn't ever accomplish any of this. As far as Dasom's performance goes, she did all right with what she was given to work with. I doubt she'll ever win any best actress awards, but she could likely make a decent living in this field if given the chance to be aligned with shows that have better stories and some decent writing and direction. Until that happens though, she shouldn't quit her day job with Sistar (which she is excellent at)!Summary: Unfortunately, I have to drop the hammer on this show; it's neither interesting nor intelligent nor original. This is clearly a project that was just designed to quickly fill a time slot and nothing more. In short, it has no heart and no soul. Don't waste your time with this.Bottom Line:  out of  stars!...Not recommended!"}, "376": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "Actually this tv series deserve at least  but because of high volume music behind the scenes just ruin the every episodes.

The story of this drama is as compelling as interesting. The one twist follows the other, as the story unfolds slowly its layers. The first part deals with the mystery of the ghost. Then, it starts focusing on the past affairs, as well as the currant ones. It's amazing how the film makers managed to present the medley of past present so beautiful, without confusing the audience or tiring them.

Lastly, the performances were great, and you can't help but eventually get emotional (even though, with most ghost dramas you kind of expect that to happen) towards the end, which, unlike other dramas that usually the story ends in episode  or  and the last one is just there to complete some side stories, this one was as entertaining as the rest. Probably, the only thing that didn't appeal to me as much as the rest of the stories, was the today's romance. The couple seemed to lack some of the chemistry they had compered to the past story.

One look at those soft, ideally feminine Asian facial features and one moment of listening to her alluring female voice was all it took to melt me. I'm glad that one of the local Korean language cable TV channels here in my part of the Eastern United States decided to broadcast this series, for I may never have discovered her otherwise. The drama itself is probably average or somewhat above average    it revolves around a love triangle involving Shim Hye won (Miss Son), a young woman who received a heart transplant and who struggles to emerge out of a sickly childhood to live a normal life and experience the normal range of human experiences and emotions, such as true love. Someone get the tissue boxes ready, 'cause tears are gonna be a flowin' on both sides of the screen.What may set this drama apart is the beautiful rustic South Korean scenery in which some key scenes are set and the wide range of stunning appearances that Son Ye jin adopts throughout this drama. She's a pretty and energetic schoolgirl one minute, a sweet young maiden in conservative dress wandering in the woods the next, and a darling bride to be at yet another instance. The combination of breathtaking natural scenery and youthful smashing girl can indeed be a potent and poignant one from a cinematographic point of view. The musical score of the series is somewhat impressive, I must say, and merges harmoniously with the theme of the drama and the scenes in which the music is played. Even when the action in the series becomes dull, redundant, and excessively emotional, the mere chance to gaze at Miss Son washes away all other concerns about the drama. If you want to see what a comely and pleasant goddess from the Orient should look like, check out Summer Scent and fixate on the uber attractive Son Ye jin as Shim Hye won for all  episodes.

I'm not going to talk about filming and directing as I know nothing about all that. I will tell you about what I saw and more importantly what I felt. First, let me say I've been a big fan of Korean dramas for the past few years. I have never thought much of Ji Sung prior to this. I thought that his acting skills were okay moderate in his previous dramas. Either he had never previously been given the opportunity to really flex his skills or he has matured with experience over the years. I was blown away by his performance in Kill Me Heal Me. It would be an ambitious project for any actor to portray  distinctly different personalities. He not only does so but accomplishes it with such depth that you actually forget that they are personalities. You begin to see them as separate people and grow attached to each character. You feel their pain and joy and root for every single one of them. This bond with the characters, without giving away any plot points is a crucial factor in the emotional roller coaster journey throughout the drama to its conclusion. Ji Sung's skills were so incredible that it got to the point where you are able to identify the personality switch just by minute changes in his facial expression even without dialog, hair and clothing changes. I cannot say enough about the amazing performance he put forward in this project. Whether you are a fan of the story or not, you can't help but admire what he accomplished with this. If he doesn't win the Daesang for this, there is something seriously wrong with the judging system. The rest of the cast, Hwang Jung Eum, Park Seo Joon and the other supporting actors all give strong performances and there are no weak links. By that I mean, you don't feel let down or bored as the plot line switches to secondary plot threads. You will laugh and cry hard in this drama. For those of you not accustomed to the Korean style of humor in many dramas, it can sometimes get slapstick and over the top which is not everyone's cup of tea. However the humor in this drama will appeal universally. There are moments that will make you laugh so much you will cry and then there are others that will break your heart and make you cry for real.If you are looking for something that is a scientifically accurate portrayal of multiple personality disorder and you are going to nitpick every little inconsistency, then skip this.

It's workable, but there are some problems.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Mi ri and Hee joo arrive separately at an orphanage as children. They get to know each other, then Hee joo is soon off to be adopted, but Mi ri ends up being the one adopted instead by mistake. A short time later, Hee joo is also adopted by a different set of parents. Then, flash forward in time to when these two girls are now young women. Hee joo got adopted by a great set of parents that enabled her to get a stellar education and basically lead a normal productive life. Mi ri got adopted by some degenerates though, and she had to grow up under less than ideal circumstances. Mi ri eventually escapes her crappy existence and reunites with Hee joo by chance. The  young female leads soon get involved with two male hoteliers, and the story is off and running from there.Mi ri is played by Lee Da hae (the main focus of this series). She plays the woman who's determined to get by on hard work & persistence going forward in life, but she has little choice to fall back on her street smarts & looks just to survive. Her actions soon lead her down a path of continued success born of small lies at first, then bigger lies, then outright greed. Mi ri is someone you'd like to see succeed because of the crappy hand in life she's been dealt, if only she would just cease devolving into more and more of a manipulative person that can't stop working every angle & person she can to get ahead.Kang Hye Jung is the other female lead who's cast as Hee joo. She's the cheerful & hard working girl who's poised to soon get her big break as an aspiring design artist, if she wasn't a complete klutz who can't ever seem to get out of her own way. She welcomes Mi ri back into her adult life only to ultimately find that Mi ri is really not a very nice person. Nevertheless, she does her best to help Mi ri due to the past debt she feels she owes her (for the adoption mishap that occurred years ago), and, just because she's simply a warm hearted person. Hee joo is easy to root for, but you do want to slap some sense into her for letting Mi ri walk over her time and again. She clearly needs to stand up for herself and start taking charge of her own life.Kim Seung woo plays male lead #  (Myung hoon). Myung hoon is a no nonsense hotel manager who's fresh off his divorce from his rotten ex wife when he rebounds into a relationship with Mi ri. Considering his recent romantic experience, he should've seen through Mi ri from a mile away, or been somewhat leery of her motives at the very least. I guess some men never learn though; he's all too willing to fall victim to the whims of another pretty face who offers a few kind words when he's vulnerable. You hope this dude will get it together before he gets in too deep with Mi ri.Park Yoo Chun plays male lead #  (Ta ka). Ta ka is the young heir to the hotel chain that's soon set to take over the hotel that Myung hoo works for. He pretty much has it all, but he quickly falls for Mi ri too. Once Mi ri finds out who he really is, she sinks her teeth into him quick and hard, and, he's powerless to resist her charms. He should also know better to fall for Mi ri (just like Myung hoon) , but Ta ka is a little young & dumb when it comes to true love, so I guess he can be given a pass in regards. However, he's also clearly an idiot for not realizing that he should be with Hee joo instead; she likes him, and she's pretty and kind and honest, and the two of them would likely make for a great couple if only Ta ka could get his head out of Mi ri's ass long enough to realize this.Our four main leads are thrown together, and it's just a matter of time to see how far Mi ri will go; will she make it to the top, will her lies destroy her and everyone around her, will she be able to make amends for all the trouble she's caused, etc?Story is pretty solid and moves along nicely for a good chunk of this  episode show, that is, until the pacing hits a wall past the midway point and the plot eventually starts spinning out of control! DAMN YOU K dramas directors & writers!...when are you going to learn how to bring these shows to a better conclusion on a more regular (and less ludicrous) basis?...There are eventually back to back episodes of  separate characters suffering brain injuries,  characters find out they're blood related (which was a hinted at story line that I was praying wouldn't come to fruition as feared), etc. All this climactic nonsense & poor final planning hurts this show significantly, and I'm downgrading it some as a result (because I'm really getting tired of this crap).I did like a solid majority of this show though, and the  main leads got their jobs done quite well, which is a big help in the overall scheme of things; I've also really taken a liking to Lee Da hae, in particular, over the years as an actress. I'm very much looking forward to see if she can pull off her lead role in the upcoming Iris sequel. We shall see!Bottom Line: this particular show is probably in the   star range.

No, although well filmed and acted, I didn't feel good watching this drama, hence low rating", "Highest Sentiment Review": "I've been watching movies and television for over  years. I only recently got into some Japanese and Korean shows. One of the best that I've ever seen was Descendants of the Sun.My Love Eun Dong starts off with a great premise of a young high school boy who meets a  year old girl who changes his life and how he lives it in a most profound way. It's clear that there is a love there, but she is suddenly forced to move away with her step parents. Ten years later, they meet again, and as they finally strike up a relationship, Eundong disappears, leaving Hyunsoo heartbroken and wondering what ever became of her.Another ten years go by, and Hyunsoo, who is now one of Korea's top actors, uses his fame and influence to try and find Eundong. What Hyunsoo and Eundong both end up discovering is a web of lies and fabrication by her current husband and his mother, as well as her own step parents, because Eundong has lost her memory due to an accident, and so she is given false memories to maintain the charade of what really happened. As the story gets going and becomes intriguing to the viewer to find out how Eundong will get her memory back and reunite with Hyunsoo, it suddenly collapses like a house of cards by unsympathetic and largely unlikable characters as well as too much melodrama. There's enough melodrama to fill three seasons of any regular show.I will say that the performances are very well acted, despite nearly all of them playing characters with such weak and mostly unlikable personalities.The stand out here is Jaeho. He is the only paraplegic character that I've ever seen who is about as cowardly and despicable as the worst villains in any TV show or movie that I have seen. The director tries to make the viewer sympathize with him, but he's devoid of anything approaching having good character qualities except for how he treats his son. Eundong is a woman who is unable to truly think for herself and find her own power within. She makes decisions mostly based on what others tell her to do. She suffers from being abused by others largely because she has little self respect and self esteem. She's a woman with a big heart for everyone but herself.And Hyunsoo, the character that we're supposed to sympathize with as much as Eundong, is an immature lout who barks orders at everyone, including Eundong. He's a + year old man who acts like a teenager. He has fits of temper that would turn off any woman who had any self  respect. There are a number of scenes that make you wonder how Eundong could ever be with someone like that, but after seeing Eundong's own issues, it's not hard to understand.The acting and production are well done, but the story and characters, which had so much potential, largely fail across the board. This isn't romantic or loving, as the story tries to make the viewer believe. This is about power and control, two things that have nothing to do with love. You wade through half of the series waiting for things to work out, and then finding at the end, a very empty and unfulfilling resolution, which causes the viewer to say, I watched this whole thing for this?!If you want to see a Korean production worthy of your time with memorable, likable characters, and love that has integrity and value, I highly recommend Descendants of the Sun. Don't waste your time with this one."}, "472": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "It's really refreshing to experience this series as a romance, tv soap, spiritual ghost story and a crime thriller. They fit together so well it doesn't feel like anything in the story was made up like weird coincidences or odd conversations to skip any possible plot holes.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Oh My Ghost (aka Oh My Ghostess) is a  episode  KTV drama. The story involves a lowly kitchen worker who wants to become a chef, the head chef as the romantic interest, and a ghost who wants to settle her grudge. There's also a murder mystery angle involved.SPOILERS AHEAD!Our story revolves around  young women; one is a lonely restaurant assistant who has a crush on her boss, but is too shy to act on it. She also happens to have the ability to see ghosts, which ain't helping her any in her personal or professional life. The other woman is a ghost who can't find her way to the afterlife because she's resentful that she died a virgin. She can't remember how she died and doesn't really care at first., she's just looking to inhabit any living woman she can in order to lose her virginity so she can finally leave this world. Ghost girl meets living girl and discovers that the chef she has a crush on is one of the few living men who can handle her supernatural sexual powers. Thus, ghost girl plans to quickly enter living girl's body to have sex with this chef in order to satisfy her desires before departing earth forever.What happens here is ghost girl periodically inhabits living girl in order to accomplish her main goal (i.e. getting laid). This creates all kinds of problems for the living girl, as she can't remember anything that occurs when the ghost girl takes over her body. Furthermore, these two women are polar opposites in terms of their personalities; living girl is timid and lethargic, and ghost girl is an aggressive loud mouth. Thus, everyone around living girl now thinks she's suffering from some multiple personality disorder as she switches back & forth from quiet & reserved to boisterous & outgoing (depending on whether her body is being occupied by the ghost girl or not).Unfortunately for ghost girl, this chef she's trying to seduce has old fashioned values and wants to take the slow approach to a relationship. She just wants to hop in the sack with the guy, but he won't acquiesce, and this frustrates her to no end. Left with few options, ghost girl and living girl team up in order to find a solution for each of their separate problems; ghost girl helps living girl blossom as an all around woman and win over the man she likes, and living girl allows ghost girl to continually try to accomplish her goal while also helping her out in other ways. It doesn't take long before these two girls become BFF's while also balancing out each other's personalities.Everything is going according to plan, but problems eventually arise. Ghost girl starts falling in love with the chef over time (which was not her intention), and living girl discovers that ghost girl's grudge may not be related to being a virgin at all. There's also an attractive career woman vying for the chef's affection that must be dealt with, and someone who might be inhabited by an evil spirit that eventually represents your main antagonist on several fronts. From there, it's just a matter of following along with the story to see how everything will play out.As usual, you need to give these K dramas some breathing room to see how they evolve before casting judgement. The first few episodes are a little rocky but the story does settle in quickly, and it's mostly entertaining for the bulk of its run time.There's a lot to like about this story and this show, and it's helped greatly by the performance of the two lead actresses. I'm quite familiar with Park Bo young (who portrays the living girl, and is the main star of the show), and she just kills it in a role that requires her to start out acting on opposite ends of the spectrum and slowly blending them into some middle ground over time. Kim Seul gi plays the ghost girl, and this isn't the first time I've seen her play a bit of a manic character in a supporting role, but she's quite good at it, and somebody needs to give her shot at as a lead actress asap. These two actresses drive this show from start to finish, and they interact so well that you'd think they've been working together for years.Jo Jung suk plays the chef and lead love interest. He's fairly likable and effective (especially when compared to the asshole head chef character portrayed in 'Pasta') and, of course, he's pretty easy on the eyes. The rest of the cast of characters not mentioned above consist of the ghost catcher lady with a soft spot for the ghost girl, an assortment of fit subordinate chef dudes ranging from reasonable to obnoxious and that get shirtless for no reason (other than to obviously appease the female viewers), along with a few others of import.This show utilizes several cooking related segments throughout, and a few ghostly special effects as needed, and while both of these of aspects are employed rather sparsely, they do serve their purpose. Production values are solid enough for this type of show, and it's competently written and directed as well (though you'll have to excuse the lack of rules of what a ghost can or can't do). There is a bit of lag during some of the middle episodes, but not so much that it doesn't comply with my number one rule for any K drama (i.e. Don't Be Boring!).Summary: Is it great?...Of course not!. But there are a number of things to like here. It does ultimately work quite well for what it is, it's also pretty well paced, and there's a nice mix of drama, humor, poignancy, suspense, love, etc. Personally, I thought it was very nicely done!Bottom Line:  out of  stars on the K Drama scale!...Solidly Recommended!"}, "1172": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "831": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1275": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "1246": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "N/A"}, "100": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "I never thought I was going to like this Kdrama.

It's (spoilers) a melodrama!SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Our main lead stars as a young single civil service worker that's tired of seeing her old school friends getting married, achieve more than her, leaving her behind, etc. She thinks she's becoming one big failure in life, while everyone else she knows has gone on to bigger and better things. There's one particular close girl friend of hers that continually enjoys rubbing salt in our main lead's wounds time and time again. Finally fed up with the increasing peer pressure from her friends, and what she perceives as her own shortcomings, our young heroine eventually cracks and she one day impulsively blurts outs a silly off handed lie to all her friends that she just got married to a rich, handsome, perfect, young, hotel heir (who is the male lead in the show).Quickly realizing her mistake, and mortified by her momentary act of childish stupidity, our young lead wants to rectify the absurd situation she's created for herself as best she can, but she has her pride at stake, and the damage has already been done anyway. Rumors about the marriage soon start spreading across Korea like wildfire, and she inadvertently impresses a hugely important future business partner as the fake wife of the young hotel heir along the way. As such, the two leads soon find themselves thrust together as a result of the circumstances at hand. Our young heroine wants to impress her friends, and our young hotel heir needs to impress his future business partners, so the two of them agree to pretend to be married to help each other achieve their own goals. The two leads couldn't be more different from one another. He's polished, well to do, smart, and reserved. She's ordinary, perky, frank, and full of heart. The fake marriage & web of lies they've both agreed to implement becomes increasingly harder to maintain as time goes on, and, they eventually need to find a suitable exit strategy asap. But, of course, they've both now fallen in love with each other during their time together, so parting ways is not that simple or easy when it comes time for the both of them to do so. Our young male lead is played by Kang Ji hwan. Gosh he's good looking, and he strikes a real nice balance between what's needed to be the leading man in his role as the young hotel heir and romantic interest. There is little, if anything, to not like about his performance or the character he plays. He does a terrific job all in all, but there's no questioning who the star of this show is; that would be Yoon Eun hye. I can't stress enough how impressive Eun hye is in her role here as the earnest hard working normal girl who eventually falls for the male lead. I can't vouch for her acting range outside of this genre, but she's pitch perfect and adorable here, and the performance she gives makes her character, and this story, almost impossible not to like & root for. The two leads occupy more and more of the main storyline as this series progresses, and they make for a great on screen couple. There's a host of other side characters, some of which you're sure will morph into the main evil bad person sooner or later, but that never really happens! What passes as the antagonists in this story (the Aunt, the brother, the former love interest, the bitchy girlfriend) don't ever get around to being overly unreasonable, or become an overbearing problem that must be dealt with via typical melodramatic methods. In fact, though not without their faults or occasional schemes, you'll likely find yourself hoping these antagonists all make out well for themselves when all is said and done.This show is about as cute as can be. From the story, to the script, to the performances of everybody involved, to the soundtrack, etc. This type of stuff is not really my cup of tea, but, I must confess that I rather liked this show quite a bit more than I thought I would.If you're a fan of KTV melodramas, you'll probably like this show. If you're unfamiliar with the genre, but are wanting to check out a pretty solid romantic love story, look no further!Bottom Line:  out of  stars!

Then, when it was explained properly his story, it became more humain and closer to a slice of life drama than a fantasy. However, I found the leading character dull. Not that the actor did a bad job with his performance. But the character was only presented as a man who hated his currant condition and was in love with the leading lady.

But like most films reaching for greatness, this is most admirable for its striking details.The filmmakers here craft a taut, careful, and delicately strung together motion picture that relishes in its amazing development of mood, place, and character.First, the mood: Haunting cinematography (rain falling on a small village at night, shadows darting across a thick field of grass, figures lurking in the woods, a masterfully choreographed hot pursuit scene on foot), a poignant music score (aided by the creepy use of a Korean pop song that accompanies each murder), and no nonsense direction (peppered with fabulous doses of comic relief  how Shakespearan!) keep the film more and more intriguing at each turn and fascinating to watch.Second, the place: South Korea, circa the late 's, and apparently under some sort of militia rule. This is inspired by the true story of Korea's first publicized (and still unsolved) serial killer case. This unique time and place serves as a wonderful respite from the typical American big city setting of so many other films of this ilk.Finally, the character development: The small details revealing the haunted souls of the detectives on the case is nothing short of brilliant. Witness the tiny executions of minutae: The cloth one rogue cop wraps around his boot so as not to leave scars when he kick boxes suspects into submission, the harried chief of police checking his own blood pressure while trying to keep his off the cuff detectives in line or fighting to keep headline starved reporters at bay, the young female officer desperately trying to showcase her abilities in crime solving between serving the chauvinistic detectives cups of fresh coffee, the outsider detective from Seoul's insistence that documents never lie (and the brutal irony at the climax that challenges his entire sense of being), and the main village detective's scathing speech on the difference between American FBI agents and Koren policemen. The beauty is in the details, and this film, like all the great ones, revels in their uncovering.One flaw is that some might find the film a bit long in the tooth, but this is not to be missed for fans of serial killer thrillers and police procedural movies.

The story revolves around two main leads trying to discover if they love each other, along with  other characters which are battling for the leads affections.SPOILERS AHEAD!The two leads are played by Gong Hyo Jin and Cha Seung Won. The former plays a washed up past girl band member just trying to stay relevant and milk her few waning seconds of fame. The latter plays the biggest star in Korea at the top of his fame.Hyo Jin is really good in her role as Ae Jung. Ae Jung has long been forgotten by most everyone following the Korean entertainment industry, and, those few people that do remember her can't stand her. Image and perception play a big part of many of the character arcs and story lines in this show, and Ae Jung's public image is that of a plain awful troublemaker. In reality though, she's just an earnest and charming sweetheart with virtually zero faults, who's just trying to get by in life.Seung Won plays the role of Go Jin. There's no two ways about it; Seung Won has a commanding screen presence; he's tall and ripped, with a deep voice and rugged features. He can be considered good looking I suppose, but he's also one downright menacing looking dude. As such, I wonder if he just takes these types of roles in order to solely avoid getting forever typecast as the ass kicker villain rogue cop etc that he appears to have been genetically engineered to play. He's quite impressive here as the narcissistic and tyrannical superstar on the outside, with a soft spot on the inside.The two other characters are played the lovely Yoo In Na and the terribly handsome Yoon Kye Sang. In Na portrays Ae Jung's former band mate who's become hugely popular in the  years since the group disbanded. She's also the host of a dating show that matches eligible Korean bachelors to various female stars. Kye Sang plays a rich young doctor that's a little slow on the up take with the ladies, and is completely uninterested in the ultra image conscious Korean entertainment industry.The story has Ae Jung and Go Jin inadvertently bumping into each other time and again. Feeling a little sorry for her, he uses his star power to help her career out some by throwing her a bone; this eventually results in Ae Jung being one of the suitors on the dating show that In Na's character hosts. The doctor is the bachelor contestant on the dating show.Meanwhile, In Na's character and Go Jin are a popular couple in the entertainment world (but are not actually a couple in real life). Go Jin slowly takes more and more of a liking to Ae Jung as time passes. In Na's character has been absorbed in the entertainment industry life for so long, that she's taken aback and soon smitten with the doctor she has to work with on the dating show that has no idea who she is and treats he like an everyday person. The doctor gets more and more inclined to select Ae Jung as his match on the dating show, because her personality and approach to life is most suited to his own. You can tell where all this is headed from there; all you have to do is just follow along to see who will be and won't be with whom, and for how long, and why.There are a number of sides stories sprinkled in, one of the cuter (although not major) ones, being the bond between Go Jin and Ae Jung's cute seven year old chunky & dorky nephew. The interaction between these  characters is pretty amusing as Go Jin continually tries to use this child to get closer to Ae Jung. At first, Go Jin (who knows nothing about children) is mostly an obnoxious and manipulative brute who frequently and openly makes fun of this kid (which he refers to as Ding Dong). Over time though, Go Jin comes to look at this nephew as his little adopted brother who he takes under his wing and gives life lessons to, helps become more popular at school, etc. In turn, the nephew becomes sort of a surrogate friend to the arrogant superstar who really doesn't have any friends of his own or anyone to confide in.This show is pretty standard fare for this genre (i.e. it's a romantic drama with a bit of humor thrown in). You'll likely find it fairly agreeable if you enjoy this type of stuff. It's a  episode love quadrangle, with a number of side back stories, and one of the characters might be dying of heart failure, so you should know by now what you're in for here if you watch this.There's a good bit to like here. The four main cast members all put in good work and interact well together, writing is mostly solid, and it maintains a nice comedic romance feel for the bulk of the series. I was not particularly fond of how this show incorporated the plot regarding the heart problems of the one character, however; it couldn't seem to decide whether this should be used for comedic or dramatic effect or how much of an integral part it should play. Also, I think they dropped ball a bit over the last few episodes trying to wrap up all the story lines, but that's the way it goes sometimes with many of these shows.Entertaining and plenty enjoyable overall...it's more than solid enough to recommend. I'd rate it in the   star range, and, I may have closely considered giving it the elusive  star rating I only rarely give out, if they'd tightened up the ending a little.

Please let me expand explain....\nSince I started watching K Drama about  months ago, I've gradually wondered if I'll ever get to see a perfect show.

Entwined with that feeling is the emotional impact : I find myself thinking of certain scenes and tearing up because they're so well written acted. Basic equation : Great Art = Exhilaration !\nI recall trying to watch Sister Is Alive recently & giving up after  episodes because most of the characters were horrible. With  But , all the main cast are lovely & it's so enjoyable to spend time with them.\nPivotal to everything is the charming & wonderful Shin Hye Sun as the talented young violinist Seo Ri, stuck in a horrific traffic accident who wakes from a coma at the age of  with her youth stolen and a virtual orphan. Yes, the scenario is somewhat manipulative yet the story is intriguing and touching nonetheless. It's a truly heart breaking yet nuanced performance and I constantly wanted to reach through the screen and give her a hug ! The boy who might've saved her but for random chance is unfairly devastated by guilt from then on, though when she re enters his life he has no idea of who it really is and Yang Se Jong as the adult man is equally great as poor Mr Gong. It does hurt when he speaks to her harshly early on yet we know why and don't hate him. He's in a zombie like coma of sorts, and to see him come out of his shell as his affection for her deepens is profoundly satisfying.\nSuperb support cast ? Check ! Ahn Hyo Seop as Gong's nephew Chan is sweet and caring with a huge heart ( his  rowing friends are also good value ); Ye Ji Won is terrific as Jennifer the eccentric housekeeper & even Seo Ri's musical rival is not the one dimensional horror she might've been in another show. And....the people playing the leads as teenagers are delightful.\nThat said, the script is the engine that drives any movie or TV show and this one is extremely impressive on various levels. Pacing symmetry is tip top. It's also very creative, skilful and thoughtful in terms of action & dialogue and carefully building the central relationship. Many scenes are supremely memorable ( eg Choco Pie, onions, fountains, Seo Ri moving out to name just a few ), plus there's ample humour & a pleasing affection for the joy of music. There are feints and trickery, and I was pleasantly surprised with the choices made in certain scenes. Above all, I felt that the writers really loved the characters and I'm sure the actors responded to that. Much love flows from many scenes and the sight of Seo Ri's surrogate family taking shape is a sight to see and cherish.\nTISSUE WARNING ! chances are very good that you will cry; I cried a lot, since many of the events are sad yet some have a positive impact too. Anyway, fans of K Drama know full well that you have to go through Hell before you get to Heaven. And though the inevitable tsunami of revelations in the final third produces an ocean of tears, it's bearable because the main couple's, um, love boat is seaworthy ( anyone for an aquatic metaphor ? sorry ! ) & you know they can handle anything.\nNow, having built my Cathedral of Praise, I do have ( sigh ) a couple of very small complaints. The gorgeous ex model Jung Yoo Jin ( so under used in W & suits, please give her a show of her own ! ) does a good job here as CEO Kang, yet could've done SO much more. We see her dismounting from a big motor bike on one occasion ( such fertile ground for development ! ) so make her cute young assistant have a crush on her. Maybe he comically fantasises about rescuing her from a bunch of thugs or cooking her a lavish dinner ? Or, dressed in tight pants or shorts, she might get off that bike & toss her hair in sexy slo mo, then we see him removing his helmet in slo mo with just a little scooter next to him. Why not even have them discover a shared interest & start real dating ? Chan's big solo swim race also annoyed me slightly because I wanted him to put his cocky opponent DOWN ! And you don't really need words : just let him offer a little sly smile when he's taunted & follow it with a wink. But, I should mention the tech side as a balance, since the show is nicely shot and quite beautiful at times ( thanks DP ). So, my gripes are obviously minor flaws & I'm feeling a bit disloyal now !\nAlright, time for some more acclaim ! I'm so grateful to the cast & crew for creating this excellent show. A beautiful work of art can be admired for its construction and for the way it connects with our emotions. This one combines both. When you're down and thinking, what's the point ?, art like  But  can bring real pleasure and make a difference to someone's life.\nBack to the P word I used at the start ( & don't worry, I'm almost done ! ).

There were so many great opportunities that were set up and there were good characters, a lot of good twists and turns as the series continued, I could almost overlook the constant shaky cam., the choppy editing, and the odd direction. However, the show peaked around episode  or so and then rapidly declined at the end. The main failings were the plot, which became pretty convoluted towards the end, the lack of resolution of major plot points and the subsequent forgetting absence of said plot points, and the plot holes that require you to suspend your disbelief and logic in order to follow what's going on and have it make sense. Then there is the final ending scene.

How are more people not upset with this? I understand that this was a tragic show and people died, but it seemed as though they wrapped up the main plot of the story, and LBH and KTH were going to get their happily ever after....except just kidding, he gets mysteriously shot and the show ends with no explanation whatsoever. That is not a befitting ending for the characters and his death was not set up at all and seemed to be a quick fix to the LBH issue and a chance to get in one last death for shock value.Giving this five stars because the plot was good towards the beginning and had some good performances in the lead roles.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Wikipedia gives the following information: Iris is a South Korean espionage television drama series broadcast by KBS in . With a budget in excess of  billion won ( million USD), it, along with its spin off Athena: Goddess of War, share the record for the most expensive Korean dramas ever produced. Premiering in October , the series was a critical and commercial success, with an average viewership of over % in addition to ranking as the top program consistently every week after its debut. The series also took home many of the highest honors at the  KBS Drama Acting Awards, including Byung hun Lee winning the top recognition, the Daesang Award. Among other nominations and recognitions, Lee and Tae hee Kim were also named as one of the best on screen couples. My Review In One Breath: This series ( episodes,  minutes each) concerns a National Security System agent who attempts to take down a secret organization. After the introductory opening episodes, the missions are similar to what one would find in the American  series (excluding the real time element), with agents attempting to stop terrorist attacks with the use of satellites and information support technicians. Of course, this is in the Korean style with some romance and melodrama blended in. Acting is top notch, with Byung hun Lee in the lead role and a very good supporting cast: Tae hee Kim (his love interest and fellow agent), Seung woo Kim (a North Korean agent) and So yeon Kim (as the gorgeous North Korean sniper). Production values are slick, the scoring is great at times, and the pacing is very fast for a K drama with plenty of shootouts (a few of which are fantastic) and suspense. Storyline is clich\u00e9d but the secret organization is intriguing and represents a brilliant little twist on the North South Korean conflict. Consequently, the relationships between the characters change significantly in exciting ways and the viewer will have an emotional investment in the protagonists.

In many ways, it often feels much more like a Japanese life lessons drama for teens, or an older American type after school special, than it does a modern Korean melodrama (except, it goes on a crazy revenge tale bender for a while in the middle of things).Here's your story: Choi Ji Woo stars as the titular character, and she is one strange housekeeper to say the least. She's hired by a recently widowed husband with a family of  young kids to be maid nanny cook of the household. The Housekeeper is essentially a mirror image of Mary Poppins; she can do everything and anything and even comes with a magic bag from which to pull whatever is needed for any given circumstance. She's also very precise, never smiles, and is completely devoid of emotion. As such, at first blush, it would almost appear she must be some type of sentient android or ghostly reincarnation or what have you.After a rocky start between them, the kids eventually take a cautious liking to their new housekeeper while their dad is busy trying to get his sh*t together; the dad is primarily portrayed as a cowardly man & absentee father for much of the early part of this show. Thus, the kids start to rely on the housekeeper more and more, and since she obeys EVERY order requested of her, they quickly find she can be quite useful. Being kids though, they frequently make some awfully rash requests that entail killing, sex, & or general mayhem. SPOILERS NOTE: there is no actual killing or sex involved, since the kids come to their senses & or chicken out before any real damage can be done.Over time, the housekeeper helps the kids learn & heal & grow via some often unconventional methods; the kids then slowly come to think of her as more of a mom than a housekeeper, and they eventually want her to join their family to replace the mom they just lost. First though, they need to figure out what happened in her past to make her so emotionless and help her become more a loving human being once again. Along about this time, a maniacal businessman is introduced into the story; the housekeeper is convinced this is the person responsible for ruining her life, and she sets out to make him pay for his perceived sins. This amounts to a very strange interlude to the tone of the original story, but it nevertheless serves as the means to uncovering the housekeeper's history and having her heal her own past wounds.That's basically it. Otherwise, it's just a matter of following along to see if kids & dad can grow closer and move on with life, see if housekeeper can resolve her past & present issues with the mysterious businessman (if she doesn't outright kill him), and to see if housekeeper is willing & ready to become part of a new family.Choi Ji Woo is rather good as the housekeeper, but this is such an unusual role; she's afforded few opportunities to break from her rigid character, though she is quite effective while acting within it. Lee Sung Jae adequately portrays the flawed man that tries to become a better dad & person over time. The businessman guy and love interest girl do their jobs well enough. There are a couple of other side characters as well: the clutzy aunt, the father in law & the housekeeper agency boss with their own relationship,and some neighbors, that are primarily on hand for some filler and buffoonery. Then, there are the kids, and, well, Yikes!The kids are focused on considerably throughout (particularly the  girls); each of the kids get their own story line, and the eldest daughter gets her own recurring sub story as a member of the lamest group in the history of KPop. The purpose of this story line isn't really focused on their music, but they are laughably bad performers nonetheless; however, the young actress that played this role did give a very nice performance overall throughout this show. The rest of the kids get progressively younger though, and they often have some difficulty handling the subject material in a satisfactory manner. I'm not going to sit here and bash a bunch of child actors actresses, but it's awfully hard to expect what looks like a  year old girl to keep up with the manic shooting pace of a KTV drama, let alone sufficiently pretend to comprehend and deal with her mom's suicide, a crappy dad, and all the other adult themes swirling around her; this poor little girl can barely even read her lines, yet she's practically THE central figure in trying to build a familial relationship with the robotic housekeeper, and this obviously creates some considerable problems during some of the more dramatic scenes involving the two of them.All in all, I didn't think this show was all that great, though it does have its moments here and there. It's such an unusual mix of flavors, tones, & story that I'm not even sure who the target audience for this thing is supposed to be; it's often too mature for kids, likely not flashy or sexy enough overall for late teens & young adults to identify with, and, it's somewhat unsuited for more seasoned K drama viewers looking for a traditional melodrama fix. In addition, I think this probably would have been a far better show if the housekeeper businessman relationship was completely omitted in lieu of focusing solely on the life lesson family value personal healing aspect that serves as its foundation.Bottom Line: . out of  stars."}, "688": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "If you like watching thriller series, this is perfect for binge watching.

His ex girlfriend has tracked him down because the little girl has leukemia and desperately needs a bone marrow transplant. When a blood test shows that he can save her life, he suddenly has a purpose for living, but then he is framed for murder because of the way he has been living. He has two weeks to prove his innocence (while being hunted by both the police and a ruthless assassin) so he can save his daughter and redeem his life.All the main actors are talented and good looking, but Lee Jun Ki is so outstanding, the series is worth watching just for his performance. He became a super star in Asia in  for his performance as the beautiful minstrel (clown) in the record breaking film The King and the Clown. Since then he has been (among other types) a playboy, a delinquent, a secret agent, a Robin Hood type legend, a journalist, and a Josean era magistrate who can see ghosts. Once again LJK is playing a role completely different from any of his previous roles and creating an unforgettable character.The Koreans like to give acting awards for Best Couple each year. There are plenty of great relationships in this story, but I wouldn't be surprised if this year saw the first Best Couple award for a father daughter relationship for LJK and the adorable little girl who plays his daughter.

The families are close knit and decisions by an individual may be subject to family approval. Social distance is maintained where formal speech is used, and personal speech forms are reserved for close friends or family. There is a strong work ethic and community cooperation unity   sometimes reminiscence of a old Frank Capra film.Most importantly, in order for the sometimes complicated sub plots to work, people fail to communicate with each other as might be expected, keeping many in the dark as to what others are doing, and this leads to misunderstandings and error judgments of some people, that sometimes seem to be unlikely by USA cultural standards.

It goes by a few other names as well: Damo; The Undercover Detective, Female Detective Damo, etc.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: It's Joseon era Korea, and various law enforcement factions throughout Korea are looking to rid the country from crime and corruption. This story focuses on the daily inner workings of one of the state police sections, which include  of the  primary characters of this series. One of these characters is the handsome, young, righteous police commander played by Lee Seo jin. The other character is the Damo, who is played by Ha Ji won.A Damo is a low level police servant, who is usually from a less than stellar upbringing and is of poor social status. However, this particular Damo has become a highly skilled, smart, ambitious, loyal, likable, ass kicking, beauty. As such, she soon rises from a nobody to a trusted & respected member of the police force. She's done all she can in life to get ahead on her own, but, much of her accrued knowledge, abilities, and current status are due specifically to her section commander, who took her under his wing when she was a young orphan, and helped her become who she is in the present.Ha Ji won is soon sent undercover to infiltrate a band of thieves; there she meets their leader who's the rd primary character involved in the story (played by Kim Min joon). Like the police commander, he's also a handsome, righteous, young man, except he operates on the opposite side of the law. He's not a bad guy per se however; he's more of a Robin Hood type who fights for the people, and helps the poor and sick from being marginalized and mistreated by the powers that be.Being a Korean melodrama, the  male leads fight for what they believe is right, while they compete for the affection of the female lead in some fashion or another. There's also the sibling angle at play here as, unbeknownst to everyone, the Damo is actually (SPOILERS) the long lost sister of the leader of the thieves. In addition, the police commander is sort of a surrogate brother to the Damo, as they've spent much of their lives growing up and living & working together. From there, it's just a matter of which of the two leads will win out, and which man the Damo will choose to side with in the end. I liked this show pretty well overall, and, it holds up surprisingly well even a decade after it aired. There's a fair amount of swordplay and wire fu involved on occasion, and although the budget couldn't have been too enormous, the action rarely looks overly silly. The  main leads all do a solid job, as do several other secondary cast members. And, the story is fairly interesting and quickly paced for the most part over its  episode run time.One of the better aspects of this show is that the  main male leads are both treated fairly equally. These are both mostly honorable men, and this makes it difficult for the Damo to decide which side she wants to be on. The story, smartly & effectively, never lets you clearly delineate which side (& man) is right and which side (& man) is wrong.One of the more odd aspects of this story, is that it occasionally tends to want to be a romantic love story. The police commander begins to fall in love with the Damo, but she is somewhat of an adopted little sister to him. The Damo begins to fall in love with the leader of the thieves, but he is her actual brother. I guess one could argue that's just the way it was in that era in regards to the commander Damo relationship, and since the Damo didn't initially know the thief was her actual brother, it provides an excuse for her to begin to fall for him. Nevertheless, I found this dual sibling vs love interest angle bordering on being a little creepy at times. One more thing, please stop with the female fighter disguising herself as a man in various Asian martial arts period pieces. You can cover up a girl's hair and rub dirt on her face all you want, but it is impossible to mistake any of the actresses they typically do this with (and Ha Ji won is no exception) as anything other than beautiful women, in any time period.This show has a few minor problems here and there, but what KTV melodrama doesn't?...All in all though, it is enjoyable and entertaining enough to recommend. It flows along pretty well throughout, it's written well enough to get the job done, and, it's not afraid to do what they wish (dramatically wise) to one or more of the characters you've invested in by the time it all wraps up.With all due respect to the other  IMDb reviewers of this show to date; A) this is not a  star watch by any means or rational, and, B) the other reviewer completely misunderstood how the Damo and her brother ultimately resolved their story line.It's plenty watchable though.

So I looked at a few reviews to see if I should keep watching, and found all these raves saying it was Hitchockian and full of twists and turns. So I thought, well, it must get more interesting. And yes, if you slog through the first hour, it does get more interesting. The story picks up, and in the last half hour there are a couple of moderately surprising twists and some genuine intensity.But comparing this to Hitchcock is just weird. Yes, the score has a bit of Hitchcock in it, but the movie is nothing Hitchcock would do; it's more of a wandering mother drama tied around a murder case rather than a suspense movie. I know the director has made genre movies in the past, but I think if a different director not known for such films were to put this same movie out, it wouldn't even be described as a suspense film.The movie also has one twist that is completely unreasonable. A similar twist was used years ago in a mystery book, and it was castigated as unfair, yet it was far more fair than the way it was done in this movie. It's not really a twist at all. A twist is when you are lead to believe one thing and then you get a new perspective that makes you see it differently. This was just a cinematic lie, and not remotely clever.The movie is watchable, and because it gets progressively better as it goes along, I have a more favorable impression of it than if I'd given up during the tedious first half. If you could edit the first hour of this movie into about fifteen minutes, you would have something short but pretty entertaining (but still unfair). Overall this was just a waste of my time.", "Highest Sentiment Review": "It's too bad that because this film is ostensibly about an old lady it must be considered a smaller film in Bong's oeuvre. It's not. It is every bit as brilliant, and as large, as Memories of Murder, in my opinion.In many ways this is the natural, and equal, follow up to Memories of Murder. It's every bit the caper film that one was, and, although slightly more somber in tone, the film keeps unraveling in directions you don't expect making it much more a plot driven movie than a character study. Kim Hye ja is, however, magnificent as the titular (gawd I hate that word but I'm using it anyway) mother. There is a scene in this film where she tells the family of the victim her son didn't do it and her eyes are so electrically charged it made me jump back from the screen. Mother fires on all cylinders. The direction, cinematography, script, and acting are all grade A. It's one of those films where each of the secondary characters steals the show for a brief period. (How 'bout that cop who kicks the apple from Won Bin's mouth?) Bong does a remarkable job of populating the world of this film with real people and manages to give them depth and development in a very short period of time. I confess to having a little trouble tracking the other female characters in the film, but no matter. There is a scene (without spoiling anything here) where Kim Hye ja asks the other 'retarded' kid if he has a mother and it's one of the most complex and heart rending scenes in cinematic history. Hyperbole notwithstanding, just freakin' WOW! on that one when you ponder just why she is crying.I wasn't sure where Bong was going to end up going as a film maker. Barking Dogs Never Bite was a reasonable debut. Memories of Murder, a masterpiece. But was it a lucky shot? I'm glad I don't have to consider the dismal Antarctic Journal a Bong film if I don't want to. The Host was lots o fun, but that's the one that worried me. Maybe he was going to start making blockbuster type films. But now, after recently seeing his contribution to Tokyo!, and now Mother, I have every reason to believe he is going to kick my butt with interesting film for a long time."}, "752": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Sirius is a  KTV special series; it's a  episode crime based melodrama concerning the changing lives of two twin brothers. It clearly lies on the grim side of K drama, but it's pretty solid overall & quite entertaining.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Two twin brothers kick off the show during their high school years; one of the brothers (Shin Woo) is timid and gets picked on by his classmate, while the other brother at different school is a strong willed, albeit decent, guy. The tougher brother (Eun Chang) is fed up that his twin is being bullied, and sets off to teach Shin Woo's tormentor a lesson. Unfortunately, Eun Chang ends up accidentally throwing the bully off the school roof top and is subsequently arrested for murder & sent to jail.Flash forward a few years when Eun Chang is being released from prison. Shin Woo is there to greet him with the news that their mother is now dead. It's clear the two brothers have both grown and changed a lot during Eun Chang's incarceration. In many ways, it's almost as if the two have switched personalities over time. Shin Woo is now a coldhearted, high ranking police detective, who relentlessly pursues drug trafficking crime rings. Eun Chang on the other hand, is a repentant and more kindhearted soul, who realizes he wasted some of the best years of his life on a momentary rash decision, and now has little to look forward to in the future as a result.The star of the show is Seo Jun Young, who plays both the twins (from high school on up to the present). He gives an impressive performance, and it's a good thing he did, because this show borders on being a one man play. I'm scratching my head trying to think of other K dramas that put as much emphasis on one single actor actress, and I really can't recall too many others that can even compare. Jun Young delivers in spades in his role(s), and, there were a few times I had to remind myself that it was the same actor playing both twins (even though there is virtually no effort to make them not look identical). He effortlessly switches from one personality to another throughout this show; from  young high school siblings, to two young adults who were shaped by the same tragic event, to grown brothers who need to switch personas & portray each other in order to eventually accomplish their goals. Seriously, the guy should win some award or something, or at least get paid double for all the work he had to do acting opposite himself in order to carry this show on his back.The secondary cast is effective enough, and include: the sinister crime boss, the mother of the twins, some cops, and the  female love interests. No complaints; they all get the job done, but they mostly all get lost in the wash compared to the importance placed on lead character of the show!There are a few flashback scenes along the way (usually at the start of each episode) that help better explain the history & growth of the family dynamic among the twins and their mother over time. I thought this was remarkably well done, and, it was a really creative way (due to the series' short run time) to fill in the familial back story blanks that would normally take up several episodes in other comparable, and more linear, K dramas stories of greater length.Be advised that this show is often quite bleak in nature, and there's a fair amount of violence involved. I won't go into details at length, but for a TV melodrama, it is surprising, and sometimes shocking, what this story is willing to do to some of its characters along the way. Despite all this, Sirius is still primarily a drama about two brothers drifting apart & coming together over time, and, it nicely mixes this aspect of the show within the overall tone of its somewhat darker story line.The series can get a little outlandish, but not really any more so than many other melodramatic shows. It is quick and to the point, and, without lot of money to throw around, it has to make do with a minimum of frills to make it all work. It accomplishes its goal though, and features a rare open ended finale that doesn't wrap everything up neatly with a big bow on top. You just have to decide for yourself what the future might bring for any of the characters that are still standing in the end.Bottom Line: I thought this show was exceptionally well done. It's tightly paced with an interesting story that is compelling throughout. And as with other shows of similar minimal length, if you don't like it, it'll be over before you know it.Bottom Line: Solidly recommended.  out of  stars!P.S. I'm really starting to develop a fondness for these special drama shows that are essentially a quick miniseries in the  to  hour range. I've seen a bunch of these shows in various formats over the last few years, and, I very much enjoy this approach to storytelling. I would like more please!"}, "827": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "This drama was awesome because of many reasons. First of all the scenery was winter which made it perfect for the characters to dress fashionably. The characters were also really cool. I liked the way the characters were all very extreme, and that there were no boring characters. You either liked the character in the drama or you hated their guts. The music (noon ae kouth snow flower) in this drama is awesome too.In addition, this series is not too long ( episodes), so you could watch it in just one day. The drama is good from the start, but there was one part that I did not like, which was the episodes  and . But the ending of episode ... !!! but the ending of episode  really gets you back into the series. Another thing that I did not like about the series was that in about  scenes the microphone can be seen. However, this drama is truly still the best I have ever scene and I have shown this drama to my family and friends, and none have not liked it. Man I cant describe why this series was so great, but one thing I do know is that everybody should watch this drama. It will probably change the way your live and think forever. All the winters will remind you of this drama... No winter will ever be the same...", "Highest Sentiment Review": "Sorry, I Love Youis usually be called MISA for short in Korean. It is the best Korea drama I ever seen. Korea drama is usually sad, but most of them are not sadder than this. The chief actor's acting is impressive. I think Ji seob So did good a job. Cha Mu hyeok must be one of the most miserable roles in Korea drama. The chief actress is Su jeong Lim. I have watched A Tale of two sisters before, her performance is perfect in that film, but I love Song Eun chae more. She is so lovely in MISA. The fans in MISA are called MISA disabled person.

The reason? Not only can I relate to the story and the characters, but every movie making element I see is flawless in my mind. The acting is superb (with Lee Jung Jae sweeping the Lead Actor Awards in ' and gaining superstardom) and the direction is worthy of a standing ovation.Like Kim Sung Soo's previous movie Beat, this movie represents the lost generation in Korean society. The two main leads (one a boxer, the other a con man) are extremely different from each other but both depend on each other to survive in the harsh reality they live in. Together they go through life, only they both find out that greed, love and pride is just waiting to ruin their friendship.Gritty, realistic, funny, it's a film which viewers from all around the world should enjoy.

JEON Tae il is one of Korea's two leading martyrs in the creation of labor unions in Korea.  A poor young tailor, who was appalled at the abuses of the workers (mainly young girls) in sewing sweat shops    and struggled through legal code (written in old fashioned Chinese characters, rather than in the alphabet most Koreans learned to read) to find the provisions that guarded the rights of such workers.  He (with his friends) succeeded in getting the press to pay attention (briefly) to both the abuses of employers and governmental neglect of its regulatory duty.  But once the press got bored, scornful labor department officials told them they were unpatriotic for complaining and the employers simply cracked down harder.  To try to get greater attention, JEON set his copy of the legal code, and himself, on fire    and ran through the streets of downtown Seoul shouting We are not machines, enforce the labor code.  His death apparently mobilized other young workers, leading to the creation of unions powerful enough to get a hearing on the issue of workers' rights.None of the above should be viewed as a spoiler.  The film maker assumed his audience would know (at least vaguely) the historical facts.  Park takes the story of JEON (set in      filmed stunningly with some of the best black and white cinematography I've seen) and interweaves this with the fictional (and told in color) story of KIM Young su (and his pregnant girl friend Shin Jung sun), set in  (during one of the most repressive periods of military dictatorship). Young su is a young law school graduate who is now on the run, trying to write a book on Jeon Tae il. Jung sun is leading a drive to unionize her own workplace.  HONG Kyeong in is extraordinary as Tae il    and MOON Keung soon is very fine as Young su.  The script by director Park, LEE Chang dong and Hur Jin ho (who was also an assistant director) and others is first rate.  The cinematography is excellent (at least).  The film ends with several minutes of scrolling names    supposedly , in all.  These, it turns out, are the names of the working men and women who contributed what they could to the making of this film.  Their investment was well spent.  A masterpiece."}, "806": {"Lowest Sentiment Review": "None", "Highest Sentiment Review": "This is one of the most tear jerking, and brilliantly written pieces of writing I've ever seen.

Easily one of the greatest shows I've ever seen, not only out of Korean dramas, but in the world. During the entire drama, I was never left scratching my head, questioning what happened to the ___, or why does ___ happen, that made no sense.
